<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to semiconductor integrated circuit devices and manufacturing architectures of the same. More particularly but not exclusively, the invention relates to those technologies adaptable for use with semiconductor integrated circuit devices having dynamic random access memory (&ldquo;DRAM&rdquo;) modules. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Currently available DRAMs are typically designed to include an array of rows and columns of memory cells-as disposed in a matrix form on a principal surface of a semiconductive substrate at those cross points or &ldquo;intersections&rdquo; between a plurality of word lines and a plurality of bit lines, wherein each of the memory cells consists essentially of a capacitive element for accumulation of information and a metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor (MISFET) for use in selecting a single memory cell, which is serially connected to the capacitive element. The memory cell selecting MISFET is formed in an active region of the semiconductor substrate which is surrounded at its periphery by an element separation or isolation region. The MISFET is generally designed to consist of a gate oxide film and a gate electrode integral with a corresponding one of the word lines plus a pair of semiconductor active regions for use as a source and drain of the transistor. A bit line is disposed to overlie the memory cell selecting MISFET in a manner such that it is electrically connected to one of the source and drain which is commonly shared by two memory cell selection MISFETs. The information accumulation capacitive element is laid out at a location overlying the memory cell select MISFET and is electrically coupled to the remaining one of the source and drain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A DRAM device with the memory cell structure of this type has been disclosed in Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-291532 and other publications. The memory cells of the DRAM as disclosed therein are designed so that word lines are increased in width or made &ldquo;fat&rdquo; in active regions (the regions in each of which a word line serves as the gate electrode of a memory cell select MISFET) and reduced in width or &ldquo;thinned&rdquo; in the remaining regions in order to retain the required gate length when miniaturizing or &ldquo;downsizing&rdquo; the memory cell select MISFETs while at the same time minimizing the pitch of word lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In addition, the DRAM memory cells as taught by the Japanese Application above is arranged so that the bit lines are partly fattened to extend up to those portions overlying the active regions and that a planar pattern of such active regions is designed into a gull-wing shape with part of it being bent toward the bit line side in order to achieve successful electrical conduction of more than one contact hole for use in connecting between one of the source and drain of a memory cell select MISFET and its corresponding bit line operatively associated therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Regrettably the DRAM memory cells taught by the above Japanese Application is faced with a problem as to an inability to provide any excellent size/dimension accuracy when partly increasing the widths of word lines and bit lines or when employing the gullwing-shaped planar pattern of the active regions due to the fact that presently available photolithography techniques suffer from difficulties in accurately achieving ultra-fine resolution of curved-line patterns and/or folded-line patterns in cases where the minimal fabricatable size becomes at or near a limit of resolution in photolithography processes as a result of further progressing in microfabrication or miniaturization of such memory cells. Another problem faced with the prior art DRAM device is that as a through-going hole for use in connecting between the lower-side electrode of an information accumulation capacitive element and the remaining one of the source and drain of its associated memory cell select MISFET is inherently disposed between a bit line and a bit line, partly fattening the bit lines makes it difficult to attain the intended through-hole opening margin, which leads to incapability of assuring elimination of unwanted electrical short-circuiting between the lower-side electrode within a though-hole and its associative one of the bit lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a specific technique for enabling achievement of further miniaturized memory cells of a DRAM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects and inventive features of this invention will become more apparent in the following description and accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings below. Note that in the following description, like reference characters are used to designate like parts or components with similar functionalities and any repetitive explanation will be eliminated for purposes of brevity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 1 ) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating electrical equivalent circuitry of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As shown herein, the DRAM chip includes a memory array (MARY) that is configured from a plurality of memory cells (MC) organized into a matrix form at those intersections between a plurality of word lines WL (WLn&minus;1, WLn, WLn&plus;1 . . . ) and a plurality of bit lines BL. A single memory cell for storing therein a 1-bit information or data is comprised of a serial combination of a capacitive element C for information accumulation and a metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor (MISFET) Qs for memory cell selection. The memory-cell selecting MISFET Qs has its source and drain, one of which is electrically connected to the information accumulation capacitive element C and the other of which is electrically coupled to a corresponding one of the bit lines BL. The word lines WL are connected at certain ends thereof to a word driver circuit WD whereas the bit lines BL are coupled at their selected ends to sense amplifier circuits SA operatively associated therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram schematically depicting an enlarged plan view of part of the memory array integrated on the semiconductor substrate; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an enlarged plan view of part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows at its left-hand portion a cross-sectional view as taken along line A-A&prime; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and also shows at its right-hand portion a sectional view along line B-B&prime; of the same. Note that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> indicate only those conductive layers (expect plate electrodes) which make up the memory cells while illustration of any dielectric films between conductive layers and on-chip leads overlying the memory cells is eliminated therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The memory cells of the DRAM are each formed in a p-type well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that is formed on the principal surface of a semiconductive substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of p-type conductivity. The planar size of each memory cell is, for example, 0.46 &mgr;m&times;0.46 &mgr;m. Although not limitatively, the p-type well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the memory cell formed therein (memory array) is electrically separated from the p-type semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by an n-type semiconductor region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is formed beneath the well in order to eliminate the influence of noises from circuitry formed in the other regions of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (such as for example an input/output circuit as part of peripheral circuitry). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The memory-cell select MISFET Qs of a memory cell may be an n-channel type one which is formed in an active region L of the p-type well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, this active region L is designed to have an elongate island-like shape that linearly extends along the lateral direction (X direction) in the drawings, wherein its size in the X direction is 1.16 &mgr;m whereas the size in up-down direction (Y direction) is 0.24 &mgr;m. In case the active region L is designed into such simple straight line pattern, any hard-to-resolve ultrafine pattern will no longer take place even when downsizing or miniaturization is done to the extent that is equivalent to a limit of resolvability in photolithography techniques, which makes it possible to achieve good dimension accuracy required. It is noted here that the dimensions of the active region L and of respective constituent components of a memory cell as will be discussed later are mere examples and should not be used for purposes of limitative interpretation of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an element isolation region surrounding the active region L consists essentially of an element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which may be a shallow groove defined in the p-type well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> embedded therein. The silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> buried in the element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is planarized so that its top surface is substantially identical in height to the surface of the active region L&mdash;namely the film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is flush with active region L. As the element isolation region comprised of such element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has no sharp edges known as &ldquo;bird&apos;s beaks&rdquo; in the semiconductor art at terminate end portions of the active region, the effective area of the active region L may be increased as compared to the same-size element isolation region (field oxide film) as formed by the conventional local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) process (selective oxidation method). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In each active region L, two neighboring memory-cell select MISFETs Qs are formed and aligned in the X direction with either one of the source and drain commonly shaped thereby. One memory-cell select MISFET Qs consists mainly of a gate oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and an insulated gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as well as a pair of n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> forming the source and drain thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the memory-cell select MISFET Qs is formed integrally with a corresponding one of the word lines WL to extend straightly (linearly) in the Y direction up to the terminate end of the memory array with the same width and same distance or interval retained along the length thereof. The width of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL), or gate length, is arranged to have a size (0.24 &mgr;m, for example) capable of suppressing the so-called short-channel effect of the memory-cell select MISFET Qs to thereby allow the threshold voltage to be more than or equal to a prespecified value. In addition, the distance or interval of two neighboring gate electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word lines WL) is set designed to be a minimal size determinable by the photolithography resolution limit (0.22 &mgr;m, for example), which is shorter than the gate length of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL). In case the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL) is designed into such simple straight line pattern, it is possible to achieve excellent size accuracy even when the distance thereof is highly miniaturized or shrunk down at the photolithography resolution limit level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL) is constituted for example from a multilayer structure (polymetal structure) of a low-resistivity polycrystalline silicon film with a chosen n-type impurity such as for example phosphorus (P) doped thereinto and a tungsten (W) film insulatively stacked thereover with a TiN film sandwiched between them. In case the gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (word line WL) is partly comprised of such low-resistivity metal (W), the resultant sheet resistivity may be reduced to approximately 2 &ohgr;/&square;, which in turn enables suppression of any possible word line delay. Additionally, as such word line delay may be suppressed without backplating the gate electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (word line WL) by use of any low-resistivity metal lead, it becomes possible to reduce by one the requisite number of those lead layers as formed overlying the memory cells involved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The gate electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word lines WL) are covered at their upper portions by a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, wherein another silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed on the side walls of this silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and of gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL) and also on the surface of the element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A double-layered structure of silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed to overlie the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that covers the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL), the upper film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of which is planarized in such a manner that its surface is substantially identical in height with respect to an overall surface area of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> At a location overlying a pair of n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> making up the source and drain of a memory-cell select MISFET Qs, contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed which extend through the silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and gate oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to reach the n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. These contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are filled with plugs (conductive layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> embedded therein, which are made of low-resistivity polysilicon film components with a chosen impurity of n-type conductivity (phosphorus (P), for example) doped therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the plugs (conductive layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed so that each is self-aligned with the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> against the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL). More specifically, the diameter of each contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the bottom portion thereof in the X direction is equal in dimension to a distance between the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the sidewall of one of two neighboring gate electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word lines WL) and the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the sidewall of a remaining one thereof. It is required that the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&apos;s thickness in the X direction be at least a specific film thickness capable of preventing leakage between the plugs (conductive layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> within the contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and gate electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word lines WL), which thickness typically measures 0.05 &mgr;m. Accordingly, where the interval or pitch of the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word lines WL) is set at a size determinable depending upon the photolithography resolution limit (here, 0.22 &mgr;m), the X-directional diameter at the bottom of each contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is given as 0.12 (&equals;0.22&minus;(0.05&times;2)) &mgr;m, which is less than the resolution limit even at its maximal value. Additionally the along-the-x-direction diameter at the upper part of each contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is set at 0.24 &mgr;m, or more or less. In this way, where the contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are each formed in self-alignment with the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word lines WL), it becomes possible to ensure successful prevention of any electrical shortcircuiting between such contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and gate electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word lines WL) even when the distance of gate electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word lines WL) is reduced through advanced microfabrication processes down at the photolithography resolution limit level. In another word, since the contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the plugs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (conductive layers) are each formed in self-alignment with the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word lines WL), the distance between the word lines can be set to be a minimal size as determined by the resolution limit of the photolithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The contact hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is one of the above-noted contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, has its diameter in the Y direction that is the same as the size (0.24 &mgr;m) of the active region L in the Y direction. In contrast, the along-the-Y-direction diameter of the remaining contact hole (a contact hole overlying the n-type semiconductor region <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as commonly shared by two memory-cell select MISFETs Qs) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is set at a preselected value (0.48 &mgr;m, for example) that is greater than the diameter of the active region L in the Y direction (0.24 &mgr;m). In other words the contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is designed to have a substantially rectangular planar pattern wherein the diameter in the Y direction is greater than the diameter in the X direction (at the upper end portion thereof), part of which is arranged to go out of the active region L and extend up to the upper portion of the element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> A silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed overlying the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed therein; further, the bit lines BL are formed overlying it. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> the bit lines BL are disposed overlying the element separation grooves <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in a manner such that they extend straightly (linearly) in the X direction up to the terminate end of the memory array with the same width and same intervals kept along the entire lengths thereof. The pitch of two neighboring bit lines BL is the same as the memory cell size (0.46 &mgr;m) in the X direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The bit lines BL are such that the distance or interval therebetween is longer than the width thereof in order to maximally reduce any inherent parasitic or stray capacitance that will possibly be formed between adjacent ones of the bit lines BL to thereby improve information reading/writing speeds. In other words, letting the bit lines BL decrease in width for widening the distance between neighboring bit lines BL makes it possible to reduce any possible parasitic capacitance. The distance of bit lines BL is typically set at 0.32 &mgr;m. In this case the width of each bit line BL is at 0.14 &mgr;m (&equals;0.46&minus;0.32), which is less than the minimum size determinable by the photolithography resolution limit value. Where the bit lines BL are designed into such simple linear pattern, it is possible to attain good size accuracy even when the width thereof is reduced by microfabrication down at the photolithography resolution limit level. In addition, letting the distance of bit lines BL be greater than the width thereof makes it possible, even when the memory cell size is shrunk, to reserve the required opening margin of through-going holes (those through-holes each connecting between an information accumulation capacitive element C and its associated contact hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> each disposed at an intersection between a bit line BL and its associative gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The bit lines BL are each constituted from a multilayer structure of a TiN film and an overlying W film laminated over each other. In case part of bit line BL is made of a certain low-resistivity metal (W), its resultant sheet resistivity may be reduced down at about 2&OHgr;/&square; thereby enabling information reading and writing to be performed at high speeds. In addition, as those on-chip leads of peripheral circuitry of the DRAM are manufacturable simultaneously at a process step of fabricating the bit lines BL, it is possible to simplify the manufacturing processes of such DRAM. Further, in case the bit lines BL are comprised of specific materials (W, TiN) of greater electro-migration durability, it is possible to reduce the rate of open-circuit defects even when miniaturizing the width of the bit lines BL down to a minimal level at or near the photolithography resolution limit level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The bit lines BL are arranged so that each is electrically connected to the plug (conductive layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> within said contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> via a through-hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as formed in the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is further electrically coupled through this plug (conductive layer) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the n-type semiconductor region <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (one of the source and drain) as commonly shared by two memory-cell select MISFETs Qs. The through-hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for use in connecting between such bit line BL and its associated plug (conductive layer) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> within the contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed immediately beneath the bit line BL as disposed overlying the element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and is designed to have a diameter that is greater than the width of bit line BL. In this way, letting the Y-directional diameter of the contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> be greater than its X-directional diameter while at the same time causing part of it to extend up to a location overlying the element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may ensure successful electrical connection between the bit line BL and the n-type semiconductor region <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> without having to designe either to partially fatten the width of bit line BL and let it extend up to the location overlying the active region L or to fold part of the active region L in the direction of bit line BL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are provided to overlie the bit lines BL; further, a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed overlying such films. The silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is planarized to ensure that its surface is kept substantially identical in height over the entire area of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Formed over the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is the information accumulation capacitive element C. The information accumulation capacitive element C is formed of a lamination, called a stacked structure in the art to which the invention pertains, of a lower-side electrode (accumulation electrode) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an intermediate capacitor dielectric film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> plus an upper-side electrode (plate electrode) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in this order of sequence as looking at from the lowest layer. The lower electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and upper electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are each made of a low-resistivity polysilicon film with a chosen impurity&mdash;phosphorus (P) for example&mdash;doped thereinto whereas the capacitor dielectric film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is of an insulative film with high resistivity such as tantalum oxide (Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>) by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the lower electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the information accumulation capacitive element C is designed to have an elongate pattern that linearly extends in the X direction shown in the drawings, wherein it measures 0.77 &mgr;m in size in the X direction and 0.31 &mgr;m in Y direction. Additionally a distance between neighboring lower electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is 0.15 &mgr;m in both the X direction and Y direction. In case the lower electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is arranged to have such simple straight line pattern, any resolution-difficult ultrafine patterns will no longer take place even when the distance is reduced down to the photolithography resolution limit level, which in turn makes it possible to attain good size accuracy required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The lower electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the information accumulation capacitive element C is electrically connected to the plug (conductive layer) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> residing within said contact hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via a through-hole <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as formed to penetrate the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> plus the underlying silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and is further electrically coupled via this plug (conductive layer) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the remaining one of the source and drain of the memory-cell select MISFET Qs. As the through-hole <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for use in connecting together the lower electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the plug (conductive layer) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> within the contact hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is laid out between a bit line BL and another bit line BL next thereto, the opening area of such through-hole <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is determinable by the distance of bit lines BL. Where the bit lines BL are designed so that each linearly extends in the X direction with the same width and same interval retained along the overall length thereof in the way stated supra, it becomes possible to ensure elimination or preclusion of any unwanted electrical shorting between the lower electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within the through-hole <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and its associated bit line(s) BL due to the fact that the required opening margin of such through-hole <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is obtainable even when the memory cell size is shrunk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Although not specifically depicted in the drawings, an interlayer dielectric film is formed overlying the information accumulation capacitive element C while letting one or a couple of metal leads be formed to overlie such interlayer dielectric film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> An explanation will next be given of one exemplary manufacturing method of the memory cells arranged as discussed above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> in the order of process steps. Note that ion implantation conditions and those values as to thermal processing temperatures in the following explanation are mere examples and thus should not be used for purposes of limitative interpretation of the invention as disclosed and claimed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Firstly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> semiconductive substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of p conductivity type is prepared which is subjected to thermal processing to form a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the surface thereof; thereafter, a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Then, form on the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> a photoresist film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> covering an active region and having more than one opening defined therein as an element isolation region, which photoresist film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to pattern the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Next, after having removed away the photoresist film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, etch the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> being as a mask therefor, thereby forming a groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a depth of approximately 300 to 400 nanometers (nm) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is deposited by CVD techniques on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is then subject to thermal processing for densification (sintering) at a temperature of about 1,000&deg; C.; thereafter, use known chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques to abrade or polish this silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> while allowing the groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to reside inside of it, thereby forming an element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and active region L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> After having effectuated wet etching using hot phosphoric acid for removal of any residual components of the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the active region L, form in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> an n-type semiconductor region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>; subsequently, fabricate a p-type well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at a shallow portion of this n-type semiconductor region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The n-type semiconductor region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is manufacturable in a way which follows: The semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is doped with a chosen impurity, such as phosphorus (P), by ion implantation techniques at a dose of approximately 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>12 </superscript></highlight>atoms per square centimeter (cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) with an acceleration energy of 500 to 1,000 kilo-electronvolts (KeV); thereafter, the resultant structure is then subject to thermal processing for activation at a temperature of about 1,000&deg; C. The n-type semiconductor region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is continuously formed at a level beneath a plurality of memory cells. In addition, the p-type well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fabricated in a way such that a specific impurity&mdash;here, boron (B)&mdash;is doped by ion implantation techniques into the n-type semiconductor region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a dose of about 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>13 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>with an acceleration energy of 200 to 300 KeV; then, the doped boron (B) impurity is activated through thermal processing at a temperature of about 950&deg; C. When this is done, simultaneously perform ion implantation of an impurity (typically, boron fluoride or BF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) for adjustment of the threshold voltage of a memory-cell select MISFET Qs at a dose of about 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>12</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>with an acceleration energy of 40 KeV or therearound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, after having removed by wet cleaning techniques any residual components of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the surface of the active region L, fabricate on the surface of the p-type well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the active region L a gate oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the memory-cell select MISFET Qs; then further form thereon a gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL). The gate oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed through wet oxidation of the surface of the p-type well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at a temperature ranging from 800 to 900&deg; C. The gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL) may be formed by a method that includes the steps of depositing by CVD techniques a phosphorus (P)-doped polysilicon film <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, depositing thereon a TiN film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and W film <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by sputtering techniques, further depositing thereon a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by CVD techniques, and thereafter patterning these films through etching treatment with a photoresist film used as a mask therefor. As previously stated, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL) is formed so that it extends like a straight line segment in the Y direction up to the terminate end of a memory array while maintaining an identical width (0.24 &mgr;m) and equal interval (0.22 &mgr;m) along the length thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, after completion of fabrication of n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (source, drain) in the p-type well <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the active region L to thereby form the memory-cell selecting MISFET Qs, use CVD techniques to deposit on this memory-cell select MISFET Qs a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and two silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may be formed by a method including the steps of doping by ion implantation a phosphorus (P) impurity into the p-type well at a dose of approximately 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>with an acceleration energy of about 30 KeV, and thereafter applying thermal processing thereto at a temperature of about 900&deg; C. for activation of the phosphorus (P) impurity doped. The overlying silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is planarized to ensure that its surface is virtually identical in height with respect to the entire area of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, etching is done with a patterned photoresist film <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> used as a mask to remove selected portions of silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which overlie the n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (source and drain) of each memory-cell select MISFET Qs. This etching process is performed under the condition that the etching rate of silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with respect to the silicon nitride <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes greater while preventing unwanted removal of the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> overlying the n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, etching is done with the photoresist film <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as a mask to remove away selected portions of the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and gate oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> overlying the n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of memory-cell select MISFET Qs to thereby fabricate a contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at a location overlying one of the source and drain and also a contact hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> overlying the other of them. As previously discussed, the contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed into a pattern of substantially rectangular shape with a diameter in the Y direction greater than that in the X direction whereas the contact hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed to have a pattern with its diameter in the Y direction almost equal to that in the X direction. This etching is done under the condition that the etching rate of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to certain silicon oxide film (gate oxide film <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> within the element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) becomes greater while eliminating deep cutaway of the n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This etching is also designed so that the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is anisotropically etched causing a portion of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to reside on the sidewall of a gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL). Through such etching treatment the contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed in self-alignment with the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the sidewall of gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL). This formation of such contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as self-aligned with silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may alternatively be carried out by a method including the steps of anisotropically etching in advance the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and then forming a sidewall spacer on the sidewall of gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Next, after having removed the photoresist film <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, form plugs (conductive layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> within the contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. These plugs (conductive layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are manufacturable by depositing on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> a polycrystalline silicon film with an n-type impurity (for example, phosphorus (P)) doped therein by using CVD methods and thereafter applying chemical-mechanical polishing processing to this polysilicon film thereby letting portions thereof reside inside of the contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. During later thermal processing at high temperatures, the n-type impurity doped in the polysilicon films constituting the plugs (conductive layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> behaves to outdiffuse from the bottom portions of the contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (source, drain) thereby lowering the electrical resistivity of such n-type semiconductor regions <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, use CVD methods to deposit on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; thereafter, etch the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a patterned photoresist film <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> used as a mask to thereby form a through-going hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> overlying the contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As previously stated, the through-hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed at a location that overlies the element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and is out of the active region L. Optionally a plug comprised of a conductive film made of a polysilicon film or W film may be buried in this through-hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Next, after having removed the photoresist film <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, fabricate regularly spaced parallel bit lines BL on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; then, let each bit line BL be electrically connected via the through-hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The bit lines BL are fabricatable by depositing a TiN film and W film by sputtering techniques on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and then patterning these films through etching with a photoresist film used as a mask therefor. As stated supra, the bit lines BL are so formed as to straightly extend along the X direction at an equal width (0.14 &mgr;m) and an equal interval (0.32 &mgr;m). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Next, after having removed the photoresist film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, etching with a second photoresist film <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> used as a mask is done to form a contact hole <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> overlying either one of the source and drain of a memory-cell select MISFET Qs and also form a contact hole <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> overlying the other of them. These contact holes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are each formed to have a pattern that causes a diameter in the Y direction to be virtually equal to that in the X direction.

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Next, after removal of the photoresist film <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, make use of the same methodology as in said Embodiment 1 to form plugs (conductive layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> within the through-hole <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the contact holes <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, use the same method as in said Embodiment 1 to form a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; after fabrication of through-holes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by etching of specified portions of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> overlying the through-holes <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>; form bit lines BL on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Where appropriate, a plug comprised of a conductive film such as a polysilicon film or w film may be buried in each through-hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The following process steps are the same as those in said Embodiment 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> According to the manufacturing method in accordance with the illustrative embodiment, forming on or over the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL) the through-hole <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> having its diameter in the Y direction greater than the diameter in the X direction while forming beneath this through-hole <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> the contact hole <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with its diameter in the Y direction almost identical to the diameter in the X direction permits the area in which the plug (conductive layer) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> buried in the contact hole <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the sidewall of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL) oppose each other to becomes less than that in said Embodiment 1. This makes it possible to reduce the parasitic capacitance possibly formed between the plug (conductive layer) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and gate electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (word line WL), which in turn enables suppression of word line delay accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 3 ) </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In this case, after having first formed a contact hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of substantially rectangular shape and contact hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of almost square shape at locations overlying the source and drain of the memory-cell select MISFET Qs by use of the same method as in said Embodiment 1 as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> (a schematical plan view of a semiconductor substrate for indication of part of the memory array thereof) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> (its left-side portion is a sectional view along line A-A&prime; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> whereas the right side part is a sectional view along line C-C&prime; of the same) and then having formed plugs (conductive layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> within them, etch a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> deposited on the contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to form a through-hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> overlying the element separation groove <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at a location out of the active region L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, form bit lines BL on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; then, make electrical connection between the bit lines BL and the plugs (conductive layers) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> within the contact holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> via respective through-holes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The bit lines BL are manufacturable by depositing on the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> a TiN film and W film by sputtering techniques and then depositing on the W film a silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by CVD techniques and thereafter patterning these films through etching with a photoresist film used as a mask therefor. The bit lines BL thus formed are such that they straightly extend in the X direction at an equal interval with an identical width kept along the length thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The bit lines BL are specifically arranged so that the distance or interval between adjacent ones thereof is greater than the width of each bit line in order to minimize any possible parasitic capacitance as formed between neighboring ones of the bit lines BL for improvement of information read/write rates. For instance, the interval of bit lines BL is set at 0.24 &mgr;m. At this time, let the pitch of two neighboring bit lines BL&mdash;namely the memory cell size in the Y direction&mdash;be set at 0.46 &mgr;m, which results in the width of a bit line BL being substantially equal to 0.22 &mgr;m (&equals;0.46&minus;0.24), which may be about the same as the minimum size determinable by a limit of resolution in photolithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>, form on respective side walls of bit lines BL sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> each made of a silicon nitride film; thereafter, use CVD techniques to sequentially deposit on or over the bit lines BL a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> plus silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in this order. The sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be fabricated by anisotropically etching the CVD-deposited silicon nitride film overlying the bit lines BL. The silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is subjected to chemical/mechanical polishing processes to ensure that its resultant surface is kept substantially identical with respect to the entire surface area of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>, etch away more than one selected portion of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> overlying said contact hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a photoresist film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> used as a mask. This etching process is done under the condition that the etching rate of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> relative to the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> becomes greater while preventing removal of the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, after having removed the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through etching with the photoresist film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> used as a mask, etch the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> under the condition that the etching rate relative to the silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> overlying the bit lines BL and the sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> comprised of silicon nitride film on the sidewalls thereof becomes greater to thereby form through-holes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> overlying the contact holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in self-alignment with the bit lines BL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>, fabricate an information accumulation capacitive element C with a stacked structure overlying the through-hole <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> by the same method as that used in said Embodiment 1, which element consists essentially of a lamination of a lower-side electrode (charge accumulation electrode) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and capacitor dielectric film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> plus upper-side electrode (plate electrode) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> So far, the present invention made by the inventor(s) has been described in detail based on some illustrative embodiments; however, it should be noted that the invention should not be limited only to such embodiments discussed above and may alternatively be modifiable and alterable in a variety of forms without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Industrial Applicability: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> According to the method for manufacturing a semiconductor of the present invention, it becomes possible to retain the required size/dimension accuracy along with resolution margins of photoresist films while at the same time enabling successful reduction of any limits as to on-chip layout of integrated circuit components. This makes it possible to reduce or &ldquo;shrink&rdquo; both the pitch of gate electrodes (word lines) and the pitch of bit lines thereby enabling miniaturization of DRAM memory cells, which leads to an ability to accomplish further enhanced on-chip integration density. Another advantage of the invention lies in the capability of reducing the area of a semiconductor chip, which in turn makes it possible to increase production yields of DRAM devices. </paragraph>
