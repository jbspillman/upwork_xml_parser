<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART STATEMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a dust collector and method for collecting dust, which is used to remove dust, mist, and the like contained in a gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In order to efficiently collect fine dust (submicron particles), mist, and the like, the applicant has before proposed a dust collector in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 10-174899 (No. 174899/1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This dust collector includes charging means for charging a substance to be collected such as dust and mist contained in a gas, spray means for spraying a dielectric on the substance to be collected charged by the charging means, electric field forming means for forming an electric field for dielectrically polarizing the dielectric sprayed from the spray means, and dielectric collecting means for collecting the dielectric which has arrested the substance to be collected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The above-described dust collector has a high voltage applied electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a ground electrode <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, as the electric field forming means, and allows an exhaust gas containing the substance to be collected such as dust and mist (in this example, SO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>mist indicated by the black dots in the figure) <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and a dielectric (in this example, water mist) <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> sprayed from the spray means to flow between the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The substance to be collected <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has been charged, for example, negatively in advance by the charging means. On the other hand, the dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is dielectrically polarized by a direct current electric field formed between the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the substance to be collected <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is collected by the dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by means of the Coulomb&apos;s force acting between the particles of dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When an alternating voltage is applied between the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the polarization polarity of the dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> changes with time, and the charged substance to be collected moves in a zigzag form. Thus, the substance to be collected <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is collected by the dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by means of the Coulomb&apos;s force acting between the particles of dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to this dust collector of the earlier application, submicron particles can be collected efficiently despite the compact configuration. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to further increase the efficiency in collecting the substance to be collected <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, it is necessary for the dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to exist enough up to the upper part (rear part) of the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In the conventional collector, however, the dielectric shows a tendency to rarefy at the upper part (rear part) of the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The inventors found that the aforementioned tendency is ascribed to the charging of the dielectric sprayed from the spray means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the particles of dielectric sprayed from the spray means are charged positively or negatively because the particles of dielectric exchange charges at the boundary of a pipe through which the dielectric itself flows. Therefore, the dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> having been charged positively or negatively is sprayed from the spray means, which is a cause of bringing about the aforementioned tendency as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the circle mark applied to the side of the particle of dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> indicates the charging state of the particle of dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. If the charged dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is supplied between the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the positively charged dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is attracted to the electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the negatively charged dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is attracted to the electrode <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by means of the Coulomb&apos;s force. Therefore, most of the dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is collected by the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> before it arrives at the upper part (rear part) of the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows a case where an alternating electric field is applied to between the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In this case, the charged dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> goes while being swayed to right and left with the change cycles of alternating electric field. At this time, the particles of dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> having a positive and negative charge are attracted to one another and aggregate, so that the distribution concentration of the dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> decreases toward the upper part of the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. That is, even if an alternating electric field is applied to between the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the dielectric <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> rarefies at the upper part of the electrodes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in view of the above situation, and accordingly an object thereof is to provide a dust collector and method for collecting dust in which the rarefaction of dielectric at the rear part of electric field forming means is prevented, whereby the collecting efficiency can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a dust collector, comprising charging means for charging a substance to be collected, such as dust and mist, contained in a gas; spray means for spraying a dielectric on the substance to be collected charged by the charging means; electric field forming means, having first and second electrodes for forming a direct current electric field, for dielectrically polarizing the dielectric sprayed by the spray means by means of the direct current electric field; dielectric collecting means for collecting the dielectric which has arrested the substance to be collected; and grounding means, provided in the spray means, for electrically grounding the dielectric before being sprayed, wherein a charge of the dielectric is caused to escape by the grounding means so that the dielectric is made electrically neutral. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, since the electrically neutral dielectric is sprayed from the spray means, the arrest of the sprayed dielectric by the electrode of the electric field forming means is restrained. Therefore, a shortage of dielectric in the rear zone of an electric field forming section is prevented, so that the efficiency in collecting the substance to be collected is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A metallic net is used as the grounding means, and the net can be disposed in a flow path of the dielectric in the spray means so as to traverse the flow path. With the use of the metallic net as de-electrifying means, a satisfactory de-electrifying effect can be achieved without obstructing the flow of the dielectric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Also, the present invention provides a dust collector, comprising charging means for charging a substance to be collected, such as dust and mist, contained in a gas; spray means for spraying a dielectric on the substance to be collected charged by the charging means; electric field forming means, having first and second electrodes for forming a direct current electric field, for dielectrically polarizing the dielectric sprayed by the spray means by means of the direct current electric field; and dielectric collecting means for collecting the dielectric which has arrested the substance to be collected, wherein a plurality of corona discharge sections arranged in the flow direction of the gas at given intervals are formed on the opposed surfaces of the first and second electrodes to generate band-shaped uniform corona discharge perpendicular to the gas flow, and the dielectric is provided with a charge of reverse polarity alternately by the corona discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the dielectric goes in a zigzag form to the rear zone of the electric field forming means under the action of the charge developed by discharge of the corona discharge section, so that the substance to be collected can be collected very efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The arrangement interval between the corona discharge sections on the first electrode and the arrangement interval between the corona discharge sections on the second electrode are preferably set so as to be equal to each other. Also, both of the corona discharge sections are preferably provided so as to have an arrangement phase difference of &frac12; of the arrangement interval in the flow direction of the gas. According to this configuration, corona discharge on the electrodes of the electric field forming section does not oppose, so that the occurrence of spark discharge can be restrained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The rear parts of the first and second electrodes can be extended, and a plurality of the corona discharge sections can be formed in the flow direction of the gas on one of these extensions only. According to this configuration, the dielectric can be collected at the extension of the electrode of the electric field forming section, so that a demister can be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides a dust collector, comprising charging means for charging a substance to be collected, such as dust and mist, contained in a gas; spray means for spraying a dielectric on the substance to be collected charged by the charging means; electric field forming means, having first and second electrodes for forming a direct current electric field, for dielectrically polarizing the dielectric sprayed by the spray means by means of the direct current electric field; and dielectric collecting means for collecting the dielectric which has arrested the substance to be collected, wherein the distribution of the dielectric sprayed by the spray means is set so that the distribution of the dielectric at the rear part of the first and second electrodes is uniformed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the dielectric can be caused to exist uniformly in the rear zone of the electric field forming section, so that the collecting efficiency is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Sill further, the present invention provides a dust collector, comprising charging means for charging a substance to be collected, such as dust and mist, contained in a gas; spray means for spraying a dielectric on the substance to be collected charged by the charging means; electric field forming means, having first and second electrodes for forming a direct current electric field, for dielectrically polarizing the dielectric sprayed by the spray means by means of the direct current electric field; and dielectric collecting means for collecting the dielectric which has arrested the substance to be collected, wherein the spray means is provided with charge providing means for providing the dielectric before being sprayed with a charge having a reverse polarity of the charging polarity of the substance to be collected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a repelling force acts between the particles of sprayed dielectric, so that the aggregation of the particles of dielectric in the electric field forming section is prevented, thereby increasing the collecting efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The charge providing means can be configured so as to supply ionized air to the dielectric before being sprayed. According to this configuration, the dielectric is charged via the ionized air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Also, the charge providing means can be configured so that magnetism in the direction perpendicular to the flow direction of the dielectric is applied to the dielectric before beings prayed. According to this configuration, the dielectric is charged by the action of the magnetism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the dust collectors described above, a plurality of stages of the pair of the spray means and the electric field forming means can be disposed. According to this configuration, the substance to be collected is collected in a dust collecting section of each stage, so that a very high dust collecting efficiency can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, fresh water is sprayed from spray means of at least the most downstream stage of the plurality of spray means, and circulating water is sprayed from spray means excluding the spray means which sprays fresh water. According to this configuration, since fresh water is sprayed from spray means of at least the most downstream stage, the collecting efficiency is further increased. Therefore, this configuration is especially advantageous in preventing the outflow of harmful substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The spray means of the most downstream stage can be provided with a nozzle for atomizing the fresh water to an average diameter not larger than 50 &mgr;m. If such a nozzle is provided, the nozzle is not clogged, thereby maintaining a high dust collecting efficiency, and the quantity of fresh water used can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The dust collectors described above can be configured so as to further comprise a dielectric circulating system for supplying the dielectric from a dielectric storage tank to the spray means and for returning the sprayed dielectric from the spray means to the storage tank; dielectric supply means for supplying a fresh dielectric to the dielectric storage tank; dielectric discharge means for discharging the dielectric in the dielectric storage tank; absorbent charging means for charging an absorbent in the dielectric storage tank, the absorbent being used to absorb a reaction product produced by a substance in the gas; and control means for controlling the quantity of dielectric supplied by the dielectric supply means and the quantity of dielectric discharged by the dielectric discharge means so that the concentration of the reaction product exhibits a value within a given range and for controlling the quantity of absorbent charged by the absorbent charging means so that the pH value of the dielectric exhibits a value within a given range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to this configuration, the deterioration in dielectric can be prevented, and also harmful gas can be absorbed and removed positively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A method for collecting dust in accordance with the present invention comprises a first step of charging a substance to be collected, such as dust and mist, contained in a gas; a second step of causing the gas having undergone the first step to flow from the downside to the upside; a third step of spraying a dielectric on the substance to be collected contained in the gas flowing from the downside to the upside; a fourth step of dielectrically polarizing the sprayed dielectric and of causing the dielectric to arrest the substance to be collected by means of the Coulomb&apos;s force created by the polarization; and a fifth step of collecting the dielectric which has arrested the substance to be arrested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the gas in which the substance to be collected has been charged is moved from the downside to the upside, so that a nonuniform distribution of the substance to be collected caused by the action of the gravity is not formed. Therefore, the substance to be collected is distributed uniformly, and is collected efficiently.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic longitudinal sectional view showing a general construction of a dust collector to which the present invention is applied. This dust collector has a preliminary charging section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The preliminary charging section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plurality of ground electrodes (positive electrodes) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> arranged in parallel and discharge electrodes (negative electrodes) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disposed between the ground electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The discharge electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is configured so that a plurality of (three, in this example) conductive rods <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are disposed vertically in a plane parallel with the ground electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a large number of spine-like portions <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged in the vertical direction of the rod <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at appropriate intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, provided with a large number of nozzles <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for spraying a dielectric, which are arranged under the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The nozzles <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are formed on a plurality of pipes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> arranged horizontally at appropriate intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is connected to a dielectric storage tank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> via a pipe <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Therefore, if a dielectric (water in this example) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the storage tank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is drawn up by a pump P interposed in the pipe <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the mist-like dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sprayed from the nozzles <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> plurality of ground electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> arranged in parallel and high voltage applied electrodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> interposed between the ground electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the dust collector constructed as described above, as indicated by the arrow mark in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exhaust gas from which dust is to be removed (for example, an exhaust gas generated when coal, heavy oil, or the like is burned) is introduced into the preliminary charging section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The exhaust gas passes between the ground electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the discharge electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. At this time, a substance to be collected such as dust, mist, and the like contained in the exhaust gas is provided with a charge by corona discharge occurring between the electrodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In this example, by the provision of the charge, the substance to be collected is charged negatively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The exhaust gas having passed through the preliminary charging section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> flows into a gas absorbing zone <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and then, after flowing upward, it is introduced into the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> together with the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sprayed from the spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The sprayed dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is dielectrically polarized by a direct current electric field or an alternating electric field acting between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the negatively charged substance to be collected sticks to the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of the Coulomb&apos;s force acting between the particles of dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The dielectric to which the substance to be collected has stuck is recovered in a dielectric collecting section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> consisting of a demister or the like. Therefore, a clean gas from which the substance to be collected has been removed is discharged from the dielectric collecting section <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Since this dust collector is applied to the treatment of a harmful gas, the sprayed dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> absorbs some of the harmful gas. Specifically, for example, in the case where the dust-containing gas contains a harmful gas such as SOx, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> absorbs the SOx during the time when the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used by being circulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> If the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> absorbs a harmful gas in this manner, the pH value of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> decreases, so that a problem of corrosion etc. arises. In this dust collector, therefore, in order to solve the above problem, there are provided a fresh water supply pipe <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in which a valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is interposed, a discharge pipe <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in which a valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is interposed, an absorbent supply pipe <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in which a valve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is interposed, and a controller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> or the like for controlling the valves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the storage tank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> contains a reaction product according to the absorption amount (treatment amount) of SOx or the like contained in the dust-containing gas. Therefore, the controller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> controls, based on the output of a concentration sensor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> for detecting the in-liquid concentration of the reaction product, the valves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so that the in-liquid concentration exhibits a value within a given range. That is to say, the controller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> regulates the quantity of fresh water poured into the tank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the quantity of dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> discharged from the tank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Also, the controller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> controls, based on the output of a pH sensor <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for detecting the pH concentration of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the tank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the valve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> so that the pH concentration exhibits a value within a given range. That is to say, the controller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> regulates the quantity of absorbent (for example, NaOH and Mg) charged into the tank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to absorb the reaction product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> If the in-liquid concentration of the reaction product and the pH value of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are controlled as described above, not only the corrosion or the like can be prevented, but also the harmful gas can be removed positively by utilizing the harmful gas absorbing function of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Although the in-liquid concentration of the reaction product is controlled based on the output of the concentration sensor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the above description, the concentration control can be carried out without the use of the concentration sensor <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Specifically, since the average degree of increase in the in-liquid concentration is known in advance by an experiment etc., the quantity of fresh dielectric (fresh water) poured into the tank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the quantity of dielectric discharged from the tank <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which correspond to the degree of increase, are determined in advance, and the valves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are controlled so that the poured quantity and discharged quantity are attained. Thereby, the in-liquid concentration of the reaction product can be made within a given range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> First, embodiments in which the direct current electric field is formed between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 1) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As described above, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sprayed from the spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has been charged positively or negatively. When the direct current electric field is formed between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the charging of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> decreases the efficiency in collecting the substance to be collected for the aforementioned reason (sticking of the dielectric to the electrode) explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Thereupon, in the dust collector of embodiment 1, the spray section is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This spray section is configured so that an earth net <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is disposed in the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and an earth net <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed at a slightly downstream position from the position where the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is disposed in the pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The earth nets <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which are made of a metal, are provided so as to traverse the flow path of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are grounded, so that the earth nets <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> fitted to these elements are also grounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The charged dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> flowing through the pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is de-electrified during the time when it passes through the earth nets <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As a result, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that has been de-electrified, that is, that is electrically neutral, is sprayed from the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The de-electrified dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having been sprayed from the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is not subjected to the Coulomb&apos;s force created by the direct current electric field between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> when it is introduced to between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Therefore, most of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves toward the upper part (rear part) of the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> without being arrested by the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As a result, even at the upper part of the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the substance to be collected is efficiently collected by the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> With the use of the earth nets <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as de-electrifying means, a satisfactory de-electrifying effect can be achieved without obstructing the flow of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a two fluid nozzle as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> can be used. For this two fluid nozzle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is introduced from the side of the nozzle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> via an introduction pipe <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, a pressurized air is introduced via an air supply pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> continuous with the lower part of the nozzle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, so that the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be sprayed from the tip end of the nozzle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> When this two fluid nozzle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used, an earth net <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disposed at the outlet of the introduction pipe <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and an earth net <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is disposed at a slightly downstream position from the position where the nozzle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is disposed in the pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the de-electrified dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sprayed from the nozzle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as in the case of the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 2) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an embodiment in which a plurality of corona discharge sections <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> arranged in the flow direction of the gas are formed on the opposed surfaces of the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively. In this embodiment as well, the direct current electric field is formed between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the corona discharge sections <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are located at intervals of L, and have an arrangement phase difference of L/2 with respect to each other in the flow direction of the exhaust gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The corona discharge sections <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> each have a configuration in which small protrusions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are disposed closely with a pitch P in the direction perpendicular to the gas flow. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> band-shaped corona current can be supplied from the corona discharge section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) to the opposed electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, when its initial charging polarity is negative, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> going between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is transferred to the electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the Coulomb&apos;s force created by the direct current electric field between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The corona discharge sections <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> release the positive and negative charges, respectively, by corona discharge between the electrodes. Therefore, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> transferred to the electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is charged positively by the charge released from the corona discharge section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, with the result that the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is transferred to the electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> transferred to the electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is charged negatively by the charge released from the corona discharge section <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, so that the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is transferred again to the electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. That is to say, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> transfers while being provided with a charge of reverse polarity alternately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Thus, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (water mist in this example) goes upward between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while transferring in a zigzag form, and is dielectrically polarized by the electric field acting between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the particles of substance to be collected (SO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>mist in this example) 9 indicated by the black dots scarcely move in the direction such as to traverse the gas flow (right and left direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). As a result, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> goes in a zigzag form while collecting the substance to be collected <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by means of the Coulomb&apos;s force acting between the particles of dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The above-described operation such that the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> collects the substance to be collected <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> while going in a zigzag form is attained by a difference in the quantity of charge given to a unit weight per unit time. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows a distribution mode of dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the case where the direct current electric field is formed between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sprayed from the spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is charged negatively. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the distribution of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is uniform in the lower zone of the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but much of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is distributed on the side of the electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the upper zone thereof. The reason for this is that the negatively charged dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attracted to the positive electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as it transfers to the upper part of the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of the present invention in which the above problem is solved. In this embodiment, the distance between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is increased, and the right and left nozzles <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the spray section are substantially shifted from the middle position between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a position close to the electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> According to this configuration, since the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sprayed from both of the right and left nozzles <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is supplied to the periphery of the electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, much of dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is distributed on the side of the electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which has been charged negatively, transfers upward in the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> while being subjected to an attracting force from the positive electrode <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which has initially been distributed more on the side of the electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is uniformly distributed at the upper part of the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment 3, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be caused to exist uniformly at the upper part (rear part) of the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so that the substance to be collected <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be collected enough even at the upper part, resulting in an increase in the collecting efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Even in the case where the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is charged positively, the distribution of the dielectric sprayed from the spray section is set so that the distribution of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made uniform at the rear part of the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Next, an embodiment in which the alternating electric field is formed between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 4) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> When the alternating electric field is formed between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, there occurs a phenomenon that the particles of dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> aggregate each other. In order to prevent the aggregation of the particles of dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it is necessary only that the mist <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> be charged in advance so as to have the same polarity. This is because the particles of dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> repel each other due to the charging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Thereupon, in the dust collector of this embodiment 4, the spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is configured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. This spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a charging section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> provided at a slightly upstream position from the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to obtain the charged dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The charging section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> includes an air supply pipe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> whose tip end is open in the pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, an electrode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> projecting in the air supply pipe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a direct current source <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for applying a high voltage to the electrode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> When pressurized air is introduced into the air supply pipe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the air is provided with a positive charge from the electrode <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, so that the air is ionized positively. The positively ionized air is injected into the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as bubbles from the tip end of the air supply pipe <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, so that the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positively charged by the positive ion of the air. As the result, the positively charged dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sprayed from the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The positively charged particles of dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are subjected to a repelling force therebetween, so that they do not aggregate between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> exists enough even at the upper part of the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, thereby increasing the efficiency in collecting the substance to be collected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> uses a magnet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as a means for obtaining the charged dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The magnet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is disposed at a slightly upstream position from the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> so that the tip end portions thereof are opposed to each other in the pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The magnet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is housed in a case <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> having electrical insulating quality and non-magnetism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Between the tip end portions of the magnet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a magnetic flux B is produced as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The dielectric (water in this example) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> flows in the X direction perpendicular to the Z direction of the magnetic flux B, so that an electromotive force e in the direction (Y direction) perpendicular to the X and Y directions is created. The electromotive force e is created based on Lorentz&apos;s law. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Ions and electrons in the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> move in the direction of the electromotive force e or the direction opposite to this according to the polarity thereof. Electrodes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B are disposed on one side and the other side of the flow path of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to be perpendicular to the direction of the electromotive force e. The electrode <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A, which is located in the direction opposite to the direction of the electromotive force e, is grounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes through an electric field formed between the electrodes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B by the electromotive force e. Therefore, the negative ions and electrons in the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> flow out via the grounded electrode <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A. As a result, positive ions remain in the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having passed through between the electrodes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B. That is to say, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is charged positively by passing through between the electrodes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The positively charged dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is supplied to the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, so that the positively charged dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sprayed from the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the positively charged dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> transfers up to the upper part of the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> without being aggregated, as described above. Therefore, a shortage of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the upper part can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is charged positively based on the fact that the charging polarity of the substance to be collected <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the preliminary charging section is negative. In the case where the charging polarity of the substance to be collected <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is positive, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is charged negatively. In this case, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be charged negatively by using charging means corresponding to the charging means shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment 5) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows an embodiment in which a plurality of stages (two stages in this example) of the pair of the spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are disposed in the direction of the gas flow. This embodiment can be applied to both the case where the direct current electric field is formed between the electrodes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the case where the alternating electric field is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> According to this configuration, the substance to be collected that has not been collected in the first-stage dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is collected in the second-stage dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, so that a very high dust collecting efficiency can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, circulating water is used as the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supplied to the first-stage spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and fresh water is used as the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supplied to the second-stage spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, the outflow of harmful substances contained in the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the demister <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be restrained to the utmost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment as well, as in the case of the dust collector shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there are provided dielectric supply/discharge means and absorbent charging means, having the valves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the sensors <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and the like. Therefore, the concentration of the reaction product in the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be controlled so as to be a concentration within a given range, and also the pH value of the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be controlled so as to be a value within a given range. In this embodiment, however, the fresh water supply valve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is provided in the supply pipe <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the second-stage spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Although the number of stages of the pair of the spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the dust collecting section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is two in this embodiment, the number of stages can be set at three or more. In this case, fresh water may be supplied to at least the final-stage spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Also, when the outflow of harmful substances poses no problem, it is a matter of course that circulating water can be sprayed even in the final-stage spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for spraying the fresh water as the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have a function of being capable of atomizing the fresh water to an average diameter not larger than 50 &mgr;m to decrease the quantity of fresh water used and to increase the dust collecting efficiency. The reason for this will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In the case where fine dust or mist such as SO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is the substance to be collected, in order to efficiently collect the substance to be collected, it is necessary only that water mist be caused to float as close as possible to the substance to be collected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In order to cause the water mist to float close to the substance to be collected, the water mist must be atomized as small as possible. The reason for this is that even when the same quantity of dielectric is sprayed, the smaller the particles of the water mist are, the larger the number of scattered particles is, and resultantly, the water mist can be brought close to the substance to be collected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Because freshwater contains no foreign matter, the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having a function of being capable of atomizing the fresh water to, for example, an average diameter not larger than 50 &mgr;m can be used. As a nozzle having such a function, there are well known a one fluid nozzle in which the spray pressure is high (for example, 5 kg/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>G) and the foreign matter passing diameter is not larger than 1 mm, a two fluid nozzle additionally using assist air, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Since a solid matter etc. of the substance collected in the circulating water exist as impurities in the circulating water, when the circulating water is used as the dielectric, the foreign matter passing diameter of nozzle cannot be decreased. Therefore, it is necessary to use a general-purpose one fluid nozzle or two fluid nozzle to spray the circulating water. In this case, the average diameter of the obtained water mist is at the level of about 100 to 200 &mgr;m at least. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Comparing the case where a general nozzle for spraying water mist having an average diameter of 170 &mgr;m is used with the case where a special nozzle for spraying water mist having an average diameter of 20 &mgr;m is used, the necessary quantity of water for obtaining the same dust collecting efficiency differs greatly. In an experiment, it has been verified that the necessary quantity of water in the latter case is decreased to &frac18; or less of the former case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The circulating water can be used in a large quantity. However, the quantity of the fresh water used must be decreased for the reason of the necessity of decreasing a utility and for other reasons. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25, a</cross-reference> general-purpose nozzle is used as the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the first-stage spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which sprays circulating water as the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a special nozzle capable of atomizing fresh water to an average diameter not larger than 50 &mgr;m is used as the nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the second-stage spray section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which sprays the fresh water as the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the nozzle is not clogged, thereby maintaining a high dust collecting efficiency, and the quantity of fresh water used is decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Although water is used as the sprayed dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the embodiments described above, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is selected appropriately according to the composition of the substance to be collected <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. For example, when the gas containing the substance to be collected <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is an acidic gas such as hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide, an alkaline absorbing solution etc. represented by an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide are used as the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so that gas absorption can also be effected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Also, the sprayed dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not limited to a liquid. For example, powder of activated carbon etc. having a charging function can be used as the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The dielectric consisting of liquid such as water and the dielectric consisting of the powder can be sprayed at the same time, or a mixture of the liquid and powder can be sprayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Further, although the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sprayed upward in the embodiments described above, the dielectric <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be sprayed downward or horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Still further, although the exhaust gas having passed through the preliminary charging section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is moved along the flow path directed from the downside to the upside, the exhaust gas can be moved along a flow path directed horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> However, the movement of the exhaust gas along the flow path directed from the downside to the upside is more advantageous in increasing the efficiency in collecting the substance to be collected. The reason for this is that a nonuniform distribution of the substance to be collected in the exhaust gas caused by the action of the gravity is not formed, so that the substance to be collected is distributed uniformly. </paragraph>
