<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to semiconductor fabrication technologies and, more particularly, to techniques adapted for miniaturization and thickness reduction plus cost down as well as reliability improvements. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Those techniques as will be explained in brief below have been taken into consideration by the inventors as named herein during studying for reduction to practice of the present invention as disclosed and claimed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The quest for further miniaturization or &ldquo;downsizing&rdquo; of modern electronic equipment results in shrinkage of dimension and weight reduction and tends to grow rapidly in the markets of electronics and semiconductor industries. Under such circumstances, it is becoming more important in the manufacture of small size electronic equipment to further improve the large-scale integrated circuit (LSI) chip mount architectures&mdash;that is, to develop an improved LSI chip packaging technique with ultra-high integration densities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In addition, as the markets of electronics grow, improvements in productivity have been more strictly required while simultaneously reducing manufacturing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A first prior known approach to satisfying the above technological requirements is to employ a resin sealed or hermetic surface-mount semiconductor device structure as disclosed in, for example, Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application (&ldquo;PUJPA&rdquo;) No. 5-129473. The prior art device as taught thereby is such that as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, this device employs a lead frame <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with a pattern of electrical leads <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and a chip support paddle or die pad <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, also known as a &ldquo;tub&rdquo; among those skilled in the art, being located on the same surface, wherein the prior art is featured in that the leads <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are electrically connected at lower surfaces to a semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via bonding wires <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, wherein the lower surfaces are for use as external electrodes each functioning as an electrical connector portion with external circuitry operatively associated with the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately the first prior art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> is associated with a problem which follows. As this is structurally designed so that the tub <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&apos;s parts-mount surface side is exposed from the lower surface of the semiconductor device, the tub <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> will possibly come into direct contact with leads on the parts mount substrate when mounting the semiconductor device on the mount substrate, which in turn makes it impossible to form any leads at corresponding portions of the mount substrate, resulting in a noticeable decrease in the degree of freedom of substrate design schemes. Another problem is that since the device is structurally arranged so that the tub <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is sealed only at its one surface, the resulting contact area between the tub <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a sealing material <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> used decreases causing the tight contact or adhesiveness to degrade accordingly, which would result in a decrease in reliability of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A second prior art resin sealed semiconductor device is found in PUJPA No. 10-189830 (JP-A-10-189830). This device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, which includes a semiconductor element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as mounted on a tub <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that in turn is supported by a hanging or &ldquo;suspending&rdquo; lead <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of a lead frame <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, metal fine leads <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> for electrical interconnection between electrodes <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on the upper surface of said semiconductor element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and associative inner leads <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a sealing resin material <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for use in sealing an outer surrounding region of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> containing metal fine lead regions over the upper surface of semiconductor element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and external connect terminals <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> that are laid out in a bottom surface region of said sealing resin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for connection with said inner leads <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, wherein said suspension lead <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has been subjected to the so-called &ldquo;up-set&rdquo; processing thus having step-like differences <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, called &ldquo;stepped portions,&rdquo; and wherein the sealing resin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is also formed at part underlying said tub <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to a thickness corresponding to the amount of said upset processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The second prior art shown herein is such that since the suspension lead <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the lead frame <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> has been subject to the up-set processing to have the stepped portions <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, it becomes possible to permit the sealing resin <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to be present at the part underlying the tub <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which in turn makes it possible to provide substantially the double-face sealed semiconductor device structure with respect to the lead frame <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, thereby offering increased reliability when compared to said first prior art discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the prior art is that in view of the fact that this is structurally designed to prevent exposure of the tub <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&apos;s parts-mount substrate side from the lower surface of the semiconductor device, the tub <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> will no longer come into contact with those leads on the mount substrate, thereby increasing the degree of freedom in parts mount design schemes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Other examples of the semiconductor device with its tub subjected to the up-set processing (tub finishing treatment) are known among those skilled in the art, one of which is disclosed in JP-A-11-74440. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Regrettubly said first prior art is faced with a problem in that a decrease in seal material-to-tub contact area can be lower the resultant adhesiveness thus reducing the reliability of the semiconductor device because of the fact that this device is structured so that the tub is sealed solely at its one surface in order to improve the thickness reducibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Additionally, although said second prior art and the one as taught by the above-identified Japanese document JP-A-11-74440 are drawn to the double-face resin-sealed semiconductor device with respect to the lead frame used therein, which offers an advantage as to an increase in reliability when compared to said first prior art, stepped portions included are to be formed through the up-set processing whereby each of them suffers from a problem in that it is impossible to improve the thickness reducibility to the extent that is equivalent to the first art and also a &ldquo;tub dislocation&rdquo; problem including displacement or strain of the tub occurring during execution of such up-set processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In short, it has been affirmed by the inventors that even the first and second prior art devices stated supra have met with limited success as to the capability of solving the conflicting or &ldquo;trade-off&rdquo; problems&mdash;i.e. the thickness reducibility and increased reliability required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is therefore a primary objective of the present invention to provide a new and improved semiconductor device capable of achieving both the thickness reducibility and high reliability at a time and also methodology of manufacturing the semiconductor device along with a parts mount structure of the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another object of this invention is to provide an improved semiconductor device capable of increasing productivities while reducing production costs and a method of manufacturing the device as well as a parts mount structure of same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a semiconductor device capable of-preventing any accidental electrical shortcircuiting and unwanted lead dropdown detachment otherwise occurring during parts mounting processes and a method of manufacturing the device as well as a parts mount structure of same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the illustrative embodiment 1 is a semiconductor device of the areal or &ldquo;surface&rdquo; mount type which is structurally arranged so that electrical leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for use as external connection terminals are partly exposed at outer periphery of the semiconductor device on its lower surface side. This semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a thin plate that is made of copper- or iron-based materials and machined to have a desired shape. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, this thin plate has a centrally disposed chip support paddle or die pad (also called &ldquo;tub&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that is supported by four suspending leads (referred to as tub suspension leads hereinafter) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which are integrally formed with the &ldquo;tub&rdquo; pad <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> laid out surrounding said tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. This thin plate will be referred to as a unit lead section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The Lower surface side of said tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (excluding outer end portions) and tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is subjected to etching treatment so that the resultant thickness is approximately half of the thickness of other portions. This processing is generally called half-etching treatment. In this way, the unit lead section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 1 has on its lower surface side a stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> due to such half-etching treatment. A semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is mounted on an upper surface (one principal surface) of the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of said unit lead section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may include certain integrated circuitry such as a microcomputer, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), gate array, system large-scale integrated circuit (LSI), memory or the like, and a plurality of electrical connection pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> made of aluminum (Al) or other similar suituble conductive materials for use as external connection terminals of the integrated circuitry. The semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is rigidly bonded by adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> such as nonconductive paste or nonconductive films with the integrated circuitry facing upwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Respective pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of this semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to one principal surface of said leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via conductive wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made of gold (Au) or Al or else. Said semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (upper surface portions and side surface portions) are sealed by a sealing resin material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> including but not limited to epoxy resin or silicon resin for the purposes of improvement in protectiveness and humidity resistivity. Note however that the lower surface portions (the other principal surface) of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for use as external terminals are exposed on the lower side surface side of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Those portions sealed by the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be referred to hereafter as sealed portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> respective one of said leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is specifically fabricated so that its upper surface is greater in area than the exposed lower surface in order to prevent unwanted dropdown detachment from the sealed portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In addition, in order to improve the humidity resistivity and also increase the parts mountubilities when mounting the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on its associative mount substrate, the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as exposed from the semiconductor device are subject to external packaging processing including but not limited to soldering metallization using Pb&mdash;Sn-based soldering processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> A thin-film fabricated through external packaging processes will be referred to as metallized or metal-plated portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> hereafter. Said external packaging may also be done by metal-plating techniques using Pb free solder materials such as Sn&mdash;Ag or Sn&mdash;Zn-based ones. Designing said metal-plated portion to have a thickness of about 10 micrometers (&mgr;m) makes it possible for the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to retain a stand-off from the lower surface of the sealed portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the thickness of the metal-plated portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The plated portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is not depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference> for purposes of convenience in illustration only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In this way, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this is embodiment is such that unlike the prior art with its stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> formed by folding machining (up-set processing), the stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed by half-etching techniques thereby permitting the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to exist at such locations; thus, it becomes possible to seal the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while at the same time realizing the intended thickness-reduced structure, which in turn makes it possible to avoid the problem as to the degradation of reliability otherwise occurring due to a decrease in close contact or adhesiveness as resulted from a decrease in contact area between the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the embodiment is that letting the lower surfaces of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> be exposed from the lower surface of the sealing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for use as external connection terminals makes it possible to prevent deformation of leads during carriage and/or mounting processes to thereby improve the reliability. In addition, as the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are projected by little degree from the side surfaces of the seal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it is possible to achieve miniaturization or &ldquo;shrinkage&rdquo; of planar size of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Additionally, as said leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are arranged so that the upper surface sealed is greater in area than the lower surface exposed, sufficiently enhanced adhesiveness is obtainable to thereby enable retainment of increased reliability, irrespective of the fact that the effective bonding surface with respect to the seal resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> consists essentially of the upper and lower surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> One example of a method of manufacturing the above-noted semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the embodiment 1 of the invention will next be explained with reference to a flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> along with FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a plan view of a matrix lead frame for use in the manufacture of the semiconductor device in accordance with said embodiment 1; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows an enlarged plan view (upper surface side) of a unit lead frame (details will be explained later) of the matrix lead frame of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is an enlarged plan view (lower surface side) of the unit lead frame of the matrix lead frame of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> as taken along line F-F; and, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> taken along line G-G. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown herein is formed through patterning of a copper- or iron-based metal plate by etching techniques. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is arranged so that a specified number of regions (referred to hereafter as unit lead frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) each corresponding to the surface area of a single semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are formed thereon&mdash;here, ten separate equally spaced regions consisting of two rows extending in a direction along long sides and five columns along short sides, by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Additionally formed at the peripheral edges of each unit lead frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is slits (referred to hereafter as stress relax slits <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) used for relaxation of stress forces as will possibly be applied to the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> during manufacturing processes, with guide pins <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for use as supporting and position alignment pins during manufacturing being formed along the long sides of the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is centrally disposed over the unit lead frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> while being supported by its associated four tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, wherein a plurality of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are provided at those locations in close proximity to the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in such a manner as to surround the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, these leads being supported by the frame. The Lower surface side of said tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (excluding outer end portions) and tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is subjected to half-etching treatment so that the resultant thickness is about half of the thickness of other portions of the unit lead frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In this way the unit lead frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 1 has a stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on its lower surface side as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is not the one that is formed at a separate process step (referred to as after- or post-treatment hereafter) after completion of patterning using either punching or etching methods as in the prior art, but the one that permits simultaneous execution of both patterning and half-etching at a time; thus, it is possible to reduce costs for massproduction of the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Additionally the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 1 does no longer require fold/bend machining processes applied to the matrix lead frame after completion of patterning as in the prior art, which in turn makes it possible to prevent occurrence of problems such as tub displacement/strain defects due to such bend/fold machining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> An explanation will next be given of a method of fabricating the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing a method of depositing adhesive onto a tub; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing a method of mounting a semiconductor chip on the tub; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing a wire-bonding method; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing the state in which a metal frame structure such as metal tool and a matrix lead frame have been position-aligned at a resin sealing process step; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing the state in which the metal tool is clamped at the resin sealing step; and, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing the state in which the metal tool is disassembled at the resin sealing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Firstly, as shown in part (a) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, make use of an adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> such as conductive paste or nonconductive paste or nonconductive film or else to bond a semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to each tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, deposit the adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on each tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by use of a syringe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>; thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, use a collet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to mount the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> on each tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> deposited thereon. This process step will be referred to as die bonding step hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in part (b) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, let respective pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> be electrically connected to corresponding leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by conductive wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made of Au or the like. This process begins with a step of rigidly attaching the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> mounted thereon to a bonding stage <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as heated up to high temperatures as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Then, while retaining the rigid fixed state, electrically connect respective pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made of Au or else to respective leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a corresponding unit lead frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by using a capillary <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. This process will be referred to hereafter as wire bonding step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in part (c) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, use a transfer molding method to seal upper surfaces and sidewall regions of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> plus tub S along with tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (not shown) and leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a sealing resin material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> including but not limited to epoxy resin or silicon resin. This process begins with a step of mounting the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the wire bonding applied thereto at a specified position of a lower metal mold tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of transfer molding apparatus, thereby tightly clamping its upper metal tool <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and lower metal tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> together. The both metal tools thus clamped have an inner space (referred to as cavity <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> hereafter) that is defined at a level corresponding to the mating surface thereof, which space permits the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> plus tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> along with tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (not shown) and leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (upper surface and side surface portions) to be sealed with the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, while letting the metal tools be tightly clamped together, fill the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into each said cavity <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through a runner <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and gate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which define a resin flow path. The seal resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> filled attempts to flow around the half-etched tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the lower surface of the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (not shown) thereby air-tightly sealing the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (not shown), and leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (upper surface portions and side surface portions). At this time the lower surface of said leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lower surface of the seal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are on substantially the same plane while allowing the lower surface of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be exposed from the lower surface of seal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Note here that it will be desirable that outer end portions of said leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> be projected outwardly from side surfaces of the sealing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in order is to facilitate cutting at cutting process steps. Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the metal tool structure is disassembled. This process will be referred to hereafter as resin sealing step. Additionally, although the above-noted resin sealing step is illustratively designed to employ transfer molding methods, sheet molding methodology may alternatively be used for performing resin sealing while letting a thermal resistive sheet be uniformly spread covering the surfaces of the upper metal tool <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and lower metal tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and retaining such state. In this case the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are projected from the seal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a degree corresponding to an amount of sinkage into said sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in part (d) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, execute external packaging of those leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as exposed from the seal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for the purposes of improvement in humidity resistivity and also improvement of mountubility when mounting a semiconductor device onto a parts mount substrate. Preferably said external packaging is done by solder metallization techniques using Pb&mdash;Sn-based solder materials; however, other similar techniques may alternatively be employable, including but not limited to metallizing methods using Pb-free solders such as Sn&mdash;Ag-based, Sn&mdash;Zn-based ones. Designing said metal-plated portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to have a thickness of about 10 &mgr;m permits the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to attain stand-off corresponding in dimension to the thickness of the matallized portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Hereinafter, this process will be collectively called an external packaging process step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in part (e) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, use a cutting metal mold structure (not shown) to cut the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at specified positions lying slightly outside of each sealing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereby subdividing it into a plurality of unit lead sections <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (those portions of the unit lead frame <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with frames removed away therefrom) so that the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is thus obtained. This process will be collectively referred to as cutting step hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> thus manufactured in the way stated supra are then subjected to a product screening delivery inspection/test procedure for separation of good products from defective ones, the former will be placed in condition for shipment. As apparent from the foregoing, the manufacturing method discussed above is free from a need to apply any fold/bending machining processes to external terminals of semiconductor devices under manufacture; thus, it is possible to make easier process management required therefor to thereby increase productivities. Another advantage is that in regard to almost all process steps, currently estublished semiconductor manufacturing apparatus or equipment may be employable without requiring any substantive modifications, which in turn makes it possible to greatly reduce or avoid risks as to new plant investment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that although in the manufacturing method stated above the external packaging is carried out by solder metallization techniques, the invention should not exclusively be limited thereto and may alternatively be modifiable in such a manner that a matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be prepared which is such that external packaging treatment such as Pd metallization or the like has been applied in advance to those lead regions as exposed from semiconductor devices. In this case the external packaging process is no longer required during the manufacture of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whereby the requisite number of process steps may be reduced thus increasing productivities accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that although the cutting process noted above is done by use of the cutting metal mold structure, this may alternatively be modified so that in a way similar to the process of dicing semiconductor chips out of a wafer, a dicing blade is used to cut into respective unit lead sections <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> after having applied a dicing tape onto the lower surface of the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this case, it becomes possible to attain the intended cutting at specified locations at or near the seal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> because of the absence of any structural limitations when compared to the case of cutting by using a cutting metal mold tool, thereby narrowing a gap distance between adjacent ones of the unit lead frames <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which in turn makes it possible to improve the utilization efficiency of the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In addition, since in this case the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are not projected from side surfaces of the seal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it is possible for the resultant semiconductor device to decrease or &ldquo;shrink&rdquo; in planar dimensions in comparison with the case of cutting by using the cutting metal mold tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Additionally, although in the above noted manufacturing method the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is prepared which has its stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as formed by half-etching techniques, the invention should not be limited only to this approach and may alternatively be modified so that a matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is prepared with its stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> being formed through coiling patterning techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a perspective view of an exterior appearance showing the state that the semiconductor device in accordance with the embodiment 1 has been mounted to a parts mount substrate, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the device structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> taken along line H-H. To mount this semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> onto the parts mount substrate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a method is employable which includes the steps of coating or &ldquo;painting&rdquo; a chosen bonding material such as cream solders or the like on leads <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the mount substrate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which correspond to those leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the lower surface of a sealing section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, temporarily attaching the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the leads <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of mount substrate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> with the bonding material <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> coated thereon, and thereafter performing reflow processes in a heating furnace (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 1 is as thin as 1 mm, or more or less, in height when mounted while simultaneously permitting its planar dimensions to be significantly smaller than those packages with leads projecting outwardly from lateral sides of a seal section, which packages typically include quad flat package (QFP) structures, thus enabling achievement of high-density mountubilities. It is also possible to prevent occurrence of any unwanted electrical shorting between the tub and leads on a parts-mount substrate because of the fact that each tub is not exposed from the lower surface of its associated semiconductor device unlike the prior art. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> A difference of the embodiment 2 from embodiment 1 is that whereas the embodiment 1 is the structure capable of sealing each tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> because of the presence of the stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the lower surface side of such tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (excluding outer end portions) and tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the embodiment 2 is arranged to have another stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at distal end portions on the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> side of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (referred to hereafter as inner end portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) in addition to the lower surface side of the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (excluding outer end portions) and tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, thereby making it possible to seal the inner end portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in addition to such tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The remaining parts of the embodiment 2 are substantially the same as those of the embodiment 1; thus, only different points will be explained below, and an explanation as to such similar points will be eliminated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a unit lead section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 2 has a centrally located tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that is supported by four tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, wherein a plurality of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are provided to surround said tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Said tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (excluding external end portions) and the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> plus inner end portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the plurality of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are subjected to half-etching treatment to have a thickness about half of that of the other portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in order to prevent accidental contact between the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, bevel machining is applied to respective leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> lying nearest to the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at their corner edges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> opposing the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is mounted and secured on the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> such as nonconductive paste or nonconductive film or else. This semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has respective pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which are electrically connected to said plurality of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via conductive wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made of Au or Al or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (upper surface portions and side surface portions plus lower surfaces of inner end portions) are sealed by a sealing resin material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> including but not limited to epoxy resin or silicon resin for the purposes of improvement in protectiveness and humidity resistivity. Note however that the lower surfaces of outer end portions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for use as external connection terminals are exposed on the lower surface side of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this way, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 2 is arranged so that the inner end portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are subjected to half-etching treatment to form a stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which is then sealed by the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling the inner end portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to have relatively free shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the lower surfaces of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as exposed from the seal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are limited in shape to those based on standards and regulations of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ); however, in regard to the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> within the seal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, no specific standards are present thus making it possible to freely design the shape and lead pitch values thereof into optimal ones in a way pursuant to the size of semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and also the number of pads used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The embodiment 2 offers similar advantages to those of the embodiment 1 in that i) it has the stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as formed by half-etching treatment, ii) the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is capable of being exist at such location, iii) the lower surfaces of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are exposed from the lower surface of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for use as external connect terminals, and iv) the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are projected by a very little amount from side surfaces of the seal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; in addition, regarding the inner end portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it is possible to appropriately design the shape and lead pitch values thereof into optimal ones in a way pursuant to the size of semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and also the number of pads because of the fact that the stepped portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed by half-etching techniques on the lower surfaces of the inner end portions of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and is then sealed by the seal resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that fabrication of a step-like difference due to the presence of the thick portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and thin portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of QFN package <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> (patterning for formation of thick portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and fabrication of a step-like difference due to the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and exposed sections <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (patterning for formation of support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) may be performed by etching techniques (e.g. half-etching treatment) as in an embodiment 11, to be described later in the description, or alternatively by press machining such as coiling process as in such later-discussed embodiment 11, by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> An explanation will next be given of an assembly method of the QFN package <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> with reference to a process flow diagram shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> along with sectional flow diagrams shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Firstly, prepare a matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) which is a lead frame comprising a tub S capable of supporting a semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having a support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>supporting the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and more than one exposed section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that is coupled to the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is greater in thickness than support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a plurality of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as laid out around the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with a thick portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and thin portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>thinner than portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for formation of a step-like difference or stepped portion with respect to the thickness direction (at step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, after having coated or &ldquo;painted&rdquo; an adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, adhere the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> together as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). More specifically, perform die bonding for fixation of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via the adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as coated on the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), perform wire bonding as shown at step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for connection between pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and their corresponding leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by use of wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that are employed as interconnect members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Here, use wire bonding techniques to connect the pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to thin portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of corresponding leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made of gold or else. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, perform molding as shown at step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> thereby forming a sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> During said bolding, the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is resin-molded by a method including the steps of covering both the thin portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a sealing resin material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while letting such seal resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> flow onto a surface (referred to hereafter as back surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) on the opposite side to a chip support surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, with the thick portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the plurality of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> being disposed at the periphery on the back surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Whereby, the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> along with the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>supporting the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> plus the thin portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are buried in the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), apply external packaging processing to the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that are exposed on the back surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for the purpose of improvement in mountubility when mounting the QFN package <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> on a mount substrate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>). This makes it possible to insure the stand-off corresponding to the thickness of a metallized portion(s) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Note here that although said external packaging is preferably done by solder metallization techniques using Pb&mdash;Sn-based solders, other metallization methods using Pb-free solders such as Sn&mdash;Ag or Sn&mdash;Zn-based soldering materials may also be employable when the need arises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, cutting is done as shown at step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Here, subdivide the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> into portions at the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> while substantially simultaneously separating the plurality of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from a frame section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the matrix lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (lead frame), thus completing the QFN package <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) (at step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the QFN package <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 3 and its manufacturing method stated supra, it is possible, by providing the step-like difference, i.e. the thick portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and thin portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, at the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> while letting the thin portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>be embedded within the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to prevent accidental dropdown detachment of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a direction along the height of the QFN package, which in turn makes it possible to prevent unwanted pull-out or discomposition of such leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is possible to set metal mold&apos;s clamp planes at the same surface level during molding because of the fact that the exposed sections <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are exposed portions of the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the thick portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which are exposed portions of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed to have the same thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in cases where the exposed portions of the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and exposed portions of the leads (thick portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) are different in thickness from each other, the sealing resin material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can flow into the thinner part side resulting in occurrence of a need to cut both metals and resin (sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) together at a lead cut process step thus leading to risks of creation of defects; on the contrary, if the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the thick portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are formed to have the same thickness then the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will no longer be disposed at cutting locations, which in turn makes it possible to facilitate smooth effectuation of the intended lead cutting processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is possible to suppress creation of defects during lead cutting processes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are designed so that these are integrally coupled together via the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> while causing the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of relatively reduced thickness and exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of relatively increased thickness to be formed in the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, wherein the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are thick portions in the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are disposed at four corner edge portions of the back surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> With such an arrangement, the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is covered by a sealing resin material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while simultaneously permitting the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to be disposed at the corner edge portions of the back surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37, a</cross-reference> chip support surface Sa of the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and chip mount side surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed on the same flat plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> To be brief, the QFN package <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of this embodiment 4 is for minimization of exposure of the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the pack surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to thereby prevent undesired electrical shorting between such tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and neighboring leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> associated therewith during mounting of a parts mount substrate; to this end, this embodiment is arranged so that the remaining portions (support portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> other than the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as exposed to the corner edges of the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are buried or embedded within the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that are thick portions in the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> come to have those portions at which any sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is not disposed and which consists of only metals&mdash;here, the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will later be subject to lead cutting processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed to be less in thickness than the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by using either etching techniques (half-etching treatment) or press machining such as coiling methods, rather than by using tub-up processing through bend machining, to thereby ensure that the support surface Sa of the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the chip mount side surfaces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed on the same flat plane; thus, the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed to have the same thickness as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> One example is that when the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> measure approximately 0.2 mm in thickness, the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which is the same in thickness as tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> have a thickness ranging from about 0.08 to 0.1 mm (cutaway amount is 0.1 to 0.12 mm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>, the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> supporting thereon a semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed so that it is smaller in size than the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In other words the QFN package <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is the one of small size tub structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, with the QFN package <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are rigidly secured (die-bonded) together by adhesive <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> such as silver paste at specified portions (positions) lying inside of bonding pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> It thus becomes possible during wire bonding to reliably support the periphery of a back surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(the opposite surface to a principal surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on which semiconductor integrated circuitry is fabricated) of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by a bonding stage <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Additionally a manufacturing method of the QFN package <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 4 is substantially the same as that of the QFN package <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 3, except that when letting a semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> be adhered to its associated tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at the die bonding process step, the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at locations (regions) inside of its pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when performing braking (cutting) of tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the lead cutting step, only metal portions that do not contain any sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are to be broken at the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of such tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the QFN package <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 4, letting the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> be formed thinner than the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>makes it possible to successfully permit the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to be covered with the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for embedment in the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; thus, it is possible to achieve the intended device structure with the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being exposed only at the corner edges on the back surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Whereby, it becomes possible to form an increased clearance between the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and their neighboring leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the back surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while at the same time preventing electrical shorting otherwise occurring when mounting the QFN package <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (semiconductor device) on the parts mount substrate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>) because of the fact that the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is buried within the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Another advantage is that since the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is no longer disposed at the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>due to the fact that the exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are thicker than the support section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it becomes possible to ensure that only those metals of exposed portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which contain none of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are cut away during cutting of the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing creation of any possible nick or gouge defects, which in turn makes it possible to improve the cutting performance at tub suspension lead cutting process steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Still another advantage lies in an ability to improve the surface flatness of the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> per se due to the fact that the jointing of the plurality of tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> permits the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be integrally coupled with the tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> while allowing them to be formed of a well planarized plane coupled with the chip mount side surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> As a result, it is possible to greatly facilitate the mounting of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> onto the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> during bonding processes while simultaneously improving the resultant chip adhesiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> A further advantage is that letting the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> be contacted together at inside locations than the pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> makes it possible to support by the bonding stage <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> those portions in close proximity to the ends of the back surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> It is thus possible to apply appropriate ultrasonic waves and/or heat to the bonding wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during wire bonding processes, thereby improving the reliability and adhesiveness of such wire bonding. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Note here that the pads <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are connected by wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to wire bonding surfaces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of to-be-connected portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of those leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponding thereto while causing the thin portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of such leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be covered by a sealing resin material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being bonded to the to be-connected portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the outer grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and inner grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Here, the thin portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the embodiment 5 are formed into a knife-edge or &ldquo;sword tip&rdquo;-like shape to permit its tub side end to slightly project toward the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which shape may be fabricated through etching treatment (half-etching patterning) and/or press machining such as coiling. An exemplary amount of such projection may range from about 50 to 150 &mgr;m. Use of such thin portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>makes it possible to prevent dropdown detachment of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a direction along the height of QFN package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> To be brief, it is possible to achieve prevention of pull-out of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> toward the QFN height direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In addition, the inner grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>as provided in the wire bond surfaces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are for use as markings indicative of bonding points during wire bonding.

<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that as the inner grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are the grooves acting as the bonding point marks, the size thereof is smaller than that of outer grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the outer grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>are the locations for receival of cutting stress forces during cutting of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; during lead cutting as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>, let any possible cutting stress forces be concentrated to these outer grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>to ensure that no such forces are hardly applied to bonding portions of the wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the outer grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>are the ones for use in blocking a flow of hot-melt metals for metallization on the wire bonding surfaces <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during formation of a metallized layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> such as at a wire bonding silver metallization step as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> In short, it is possible to permit the groove shape resulting from the presence of outer grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>to be greater in absolute distance than flat surfaces; thus, it becomes possible to increase the leak pass length when forming said metallized part, thereby enabling prevention of any unwanted flow of melted metals used therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as it is possible to permit the groove shape due to the outer grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>to be greater in absolute distance than flat surfaces, it is also possible to prevent immersion or &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; of water component into the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the outer grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>are formed so that these are greater in size than the inner grooves <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. This makes it possible to reliably perform both prevention of unwanted concentration of stress forces during lead cutting and also undesired metal flowage during metallization processes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> In addition, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are such that each is provided on its side surfaces with knife edge portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>which are projected by little toward the width direction thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Use of such knife edge portions <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>makes it possible to prevent the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from attempting to drop down in a direction along the height of QFN package.

<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> One example is that only the outer groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>which is a single groove may be provided in the wire bonding surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of a lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; if this is the case, a wire <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be bonded for electrical connection to its associated to-be-connected portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>at an inside location relative to the outer groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Whereby, it is possible to prevent concentration of stress forces during lead cutting while simultaneously eliminating any irregular metal flowage during metallization processes in the same way as that stated supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Note that only the inner groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>which is a single groove may be provided in the wire bonding surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of a lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; in such case, a wire <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be bonded to a to-be-connected portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>at part lying outside of the inner groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> The embodiment 6 is directed to a case where certain leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the plurality of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are disposed neighboring a tub suspension lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and placed on the opposite sides thereof-are taken up, wherein a tapered section (cutaway portion) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>is provided at a selected distal end of each lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> opposing the tub suspension lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for formation of a gap <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>lying between the lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and tub suspension lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and extending along this lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> This taper section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>is a cutaway portion for formation of the gap <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>as required for effectuation of necessary processes when forming a lead pattern by etching treatment or press machining techniques-for example, a gap of about 80% of a lead plate thickness will be required for patterning purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> In particular, when the layout density of those leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as disposed between tub suspension leads increases as a result of an increase in requisite number of pins used, the tub suspension lead side distal end of a lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> neighboring a tub suspension lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comes closer to the tub suspension lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that it will become impossible or at least greatly difficult to perform the intended patterning of such tub suspension lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or alternatively its neighboring lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, by providing the taper section (cutaway portion) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>for formation of the gap <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>at the tub suspension lead side distal end portion of the lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in close proximity in position to the tub suspension lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it becomes possible to fabricate any intended lead pattern of those leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as disposed adjacent to tub suspension leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> while at the same time making it possible to cope with an increase in requisite number of pins used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Whereby, it is possible to prevent the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from attempting to enter the interior of the groove <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, which in turn makes it possible to preclude creation of nick defects otherwise occurring due to floating of resin (sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) junk components and also punching abrasion due to resin cutting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> It is thus possible to achieve longer lifetime of a lead cutting punch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that since the length (LP) of the to-be-connected portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as exposed to the back surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is defined by the EIAJ standards as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>, the extension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>must be buried or embedded within the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the event that the lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided with such extension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>; in view of this, the semiconductor device of the embodiment 9 is specifically arranged so that the extension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>is formed to be thinner than the to-be-connected portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and is then embedded within the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> without having to make higher the position of the extension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>(without performing any lead rise-up processing). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the extension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>at each lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed so that it is thinner than the to-be-connected portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>as exposed to the back surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is simultaneously covered by the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> together with the tub <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Additionally the thinner formation of the extension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>than the to-be-connected portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>makes it possible to prevent dropdown detachment of its associative lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the thickness direction of the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Further, since the extension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>has an increased distance in its elongate direction in comparison with the knife edge-shaped thin portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, it is also possible to dispose the bonding stage <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>) at a specified location beneath the extension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>during wire bonding, which in turn makes it possible to apply optimal ultrasonic waves or heat to both the wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during wire bonding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Note that the extension <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>may be formed thinner by etching treatment (half-etching patterning) or alternatively press machining techniques such as coiling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> Also note that as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54, a</cross-reference> lead groove portion (groove) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>is formed at a selected location of the to-be-connected portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of each lead <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> near the outside of the wire bonding surface <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(surface on the opposite side to the exposure side) that is laid out within the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> This lead groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>is the same in function to the outer groove portion <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>) as has been explained in conjunction with the embodiment 5; thus, it is possible to concentrate cutting stress forces to this lead groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>during cutting processes using a punch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>, thereby preventing such stresses from being applied to bonding portions of wires <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Further, the presence of the lead groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>makes it possible to block a flow of hot-melt metals when forming a metal-plated layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> such as a silver-metallized one used for wire bonding purposes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as it is possible to permit a groove shape due to presence of the lead groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>to offer a longer absolute distance than flat surfaces; thus, it becomes possible to prevent unwanted invasion of water component into the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> In addition, as the sealing resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> attempts to enter the lead groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>due to molding, it is possible to prevent dropdown detachment of leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with respect to the elongate direction of such leads <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Effects and advantages obtainable by representative ones of the inventive teachings as disclosed herein will be explained in brief below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> (1) As it is possible to form a stepped portion or portions through half-etching patterning processes rather than formation of such stepped portions through bend/fold machining (up-set processing) to thereby permit existence of a sealing resin material at there, it becomes possible to successfully seal the tub and the tub suspension leads with the sealing resin while at the same time achieving the intended thickness-reduced or thinned structure, which in turn makes it possible to avoid the problem as to degradation of reliability due to decrease in adhesion strength as resulted from reduction of the contact area between the sealing resin and the tub. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> (2) Since the lower surfaces of leads are forced to be exposed from the lower surface of a semiconductor device and are then used as external connection terminals, it is possible to prevent unwanted deformation or distortion of such leads in carriage and/or mounting events, thereby improving the reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> (3) As the leads used are designed to be projected very little from the side surfaces of a sealing section, it becomes possible for the semiconductor device to shrink in planar size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> (4) As the leads are formed to have their sealed or hermetic upper surfaces wider than exposed lower surfaces thereof, it is possible to attain sufficiently increased adhesiveness irrespective of the fact that the resulting bonding surfaces with the sealing resin consist of upper and side surfaces only, thereby enabling retainment of the reliability required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> (5) As the stepped portion-of a matrix lead frame is fabricated through simultaneous execution of patterning and half-etching treatment processes unlike the prior art approaches which have been designed to fabricate it through post-processing after completion of either punching or patterning using etch techniques of a metal plate, it is possible to reduce production costs of such matrix lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> (6) As the matrix lead frame does no longer require effectuation of any bend/fold processes with respect to the matrix lead frame after completion of patterning as has been employed in the prior art, it becomes possible to prevent occurrence of problems such as tub dislocation defects or the like due to such folding processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> (7) As, unlike the prior art, it is no longer required to apply bend/folding processes to the semiconductor device&apos;s external terminals, the requisite number of process steps may be reduced thereby making easier the process management to thereby improve the productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> (8) In all processes concerned, the currently estublished semiconductor manufacturing apparatus or equipment is employable for fabrication of the semiconductor device of the invention without requiring any substantive alterations thereto, which advantageously serves to eliminate or at least minimize risks of capital investment of new facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> (9) As the stepped portion is formed by applying half-etching treatment to the lower surfaces of inner ends of leads and then sealing them with a sealing resin material, it is possible to optimally design the shape and lead pitch values in a way conformity with the semiconductor chip size and the number of pads thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> (10) As the tub support section at tub suspension leads is formed to be thinner than the exposed portion, it is possible to attain the intended structure with the exposed portion being exposed only to corner edge portions of the back surface of a sealing section. Whereby, it is possible to increase or maximize the clearance as defined on the back surface of the seal section between the exposed portions of the tub suspension leads and its neighboring leads; in addition, arranging the tub to be embedded within the seal section makes it possible to prevent electrical shorting otherwise occurring when mounting a semiconductor device onto a parts-mount substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> (11) As the sealing resin is by no means disposed at the exposed portion due to the fact that the exposed portion is thicker than the support section in the tub suspension leads, only target metal components of the exposed portion containing no sealing resin materials will be cut during tub suspension lead cutting processes; as a result, it is possible to improve the cutting performance and reliability at such tub suspension lead cutting steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> (12) As the tub suspension leads are coupled together via a tub resulting in integral linkage between the tub and the tub suspension leads while permitting formation by a flat plane coupled to its chip mount side surface, the surface flatness of the tub per se may be improved. As a result, it is possible to make easier the procedure of mounting a semiconductor chip onto the tub during bonding while simultaneously improving the chip adhesiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> (13) As the tub and its associative semiconductor chip are bonded together at a selected location lying inside of an array of surface electrodes of the semiconductor chip, it is possible to stubly support by a bonding stage those portions at or near the end portions on the back surface of the semiconductor chip. Thus, it is possible to apply adequate ultrasonic waves and/or heat to bonding wires during wire bonding, thereby making it possible to improve the reliability and adhesiveness of wire bonding processes. </paragraph>
