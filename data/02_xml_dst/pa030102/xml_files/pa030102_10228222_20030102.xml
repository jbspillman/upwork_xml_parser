<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An optical disk physical has a recording region divided into zones, each zone including physical tracks adjacent to each other. An integer number of sectors, are provided in each physical track. The angular recording density is higher in the more outward zones such that the linear recording density is substantially constant throughout the recording region, and logical tracks are formed of a predetermined number of sectors, independent of the physical tracks. The conversion between the logical track and sector addresses read from the disk and the linear logical addresses supplied from a host device is easy. The addresses written in headers of the sectors in the logical track in which data are actually recorded, including substitute sectors used in place of defect sectors, are preferably consecutive to further facilitate the conversion between the logical track and sector addresses read from the disk and the linear logical addresses supplied from the host device. Each of the zones can be set to serve as any of the different types of recording area, independently of other zones. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical disk permitting reading and writing of data while being rotated at a constant angular velocity, and more particularly to an optical disk having a recording surface divided into a plurality of zones, with clocks of higher frequencies being used for the access to the more outward zones so that the recording linear density is substantially identical between the outer and inner zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to an optical disk which contains different types of recording media for the respective zones, and in which the types of the respective zones can be altered during use of the disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to an optical disk drive device used for writing in and reading from the above-mentioned optical disks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Known optical disks of the type having a storage capacity of 1 GB on each surface have a format proposed in ECMA/TC31/92/36. According to this proposal, the recording surface of the optical disk is divided into a plurality of zones equally, i.e., such that the numbers of the physical tracks in the respective zones are substantialy equal. The number of zones depends on the size of the sector. If each sector consists of 512 bytes, the number of the zones is 54. If each sector consists of 1024 bytes, the number of the zones is 30. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Each physical track has an integer number of sectors The number of sectors in each track is constant throughout each zone. The number of sectors in each track is larger in more outward zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The optical disks that are available are either those of the R/W (read/write or rewritable) type which permit writing and rewriting as desired, and those of the WO (write-once) type which permit writing only once after fabrication, and those of O-ROM (embossed) type in which data is written at the time of fabrication, by embossing, and which do not permit writing after fabrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The number of sectors in each physical track differs from one zone to another, as described above. A complex algorithm is needed for indexing the physical location of the target sector when for instance the optical disk is used as a SCSI device, and is supplied with linear (consecutive-integer-numbered) logical addresses. Moreover, the data field in each sector in an innermost physical track of a certain zone and the header field in each sector in an outermost physical track of another zone next to and inside of the first-mentioned zone may be adjacent to catch other, with the result that the crosstalk from the header field may degrade the quality of the data read from the data field. This is because the information in the header field is written in the form of pit (embossment) and has a greater degree of modulation, causing a greater crosstalk, while the information in the data field is magneto-optically written and has a smaller degree of modulation. In this connection, it is noted that within each zone, header fields in all the tracks are radially aligned and data fields in all the tracks are radially aligned, so that a header field and a data field will not be adjacent to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is also desired that recording areas of the R/W type, of the WO type and of the O-ROM type be co-existing in a single disk to expand the application of the disks. In the past, optical disks of the P-ROM type, in which the recording areas of the R/W type and the recording areas of the O-ROM type are coexisting, were available. But, no other combination of recording areas have been known. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to provide an optical disk which enables quick indexing of the physical location of the target sector responsive to a given address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide an optical disk permitting mixed presence of recording areas of different types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide an optical disk drive used for such optical disks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an optical disk comprising a recording region, physical tracks in said recording region each corresponding to one revolution, said recording region being divided into a plurality of zones by one or more circular boundary lines centered on the center of the disk, each zone comprising a plurality of physical tracks adjacent to each other, wherein an integer number of sectors are provided in each physical track, the angular recording density is higher in the more outward zones such that the linear recording density is substantially constant throughout the recording region, and logical tracks are formed of a predetermined number of sectors, independent of the physical tracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, each logical track is formed of sectors, independent of the physical tracks, and the number of the sectors in each logical track is constant throughout the recording region, regardless of the radial position of the sector within the recording region, so that the conversion between the logical track and sector addresses read from the disk, at the sectors being accessed by the read/write head, and the linear logical addresses (one-dimensional addresses, or addresses represented by consecutive integers) supplied from a host device is easy, and the grouping and defect management are easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The addresses written in headers of the sectors in the logical track in which data are actually recorded,including substitute sectors used in place of defect sectors, are preferably consecutive to further facilitate the conversion between the logical track and sector addresses read from the disk and the linear logical addresses supplied from the host device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The difference obtained by subtracting the number of the logical tracks corresponding to each zone from the number of the logical tracks corresponding to another zone adjacent to and radially outside of said each zone is preferably constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, the address management of the disk is facilitated, and the number of the logical tracks in the zone in question can be determined through simple calculation on integers, without referring to a table for address conversion, and the determination of the target sector during seek operation can be made with ease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The number of the physical tracks of zones adjacent to each other are preferably made equal by providing sectors in which data is not recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, the calculation for determining the number of tracks to be traversed for accessing the target track is easy, and the management of the physical location is easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Addresses of the sectors in the tracks in which data is not recorded may be assigned independently of the addresses of the sectors in the tracks in which data is recorded. Similarly, addresses of the sectors in the test track in each zone are assigned independently of the addresses of the sectors in the tracks in which data is recorded. With this arrangement, management of the tracks in which data is not recorded and the test tracks is facilitated. The logical track and sector addresses are of consecutive values, so that the address management of the recorded data is facilitated. Access management of the test tracks is also facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The difference obtained by subtracting the number of sectors in each zone in which data is not recorded from the number of sectors in another zone adjacent to and outside of said each zone and in which data is not recorded is preferably constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, the number of the sectors in each zone in which data is not recorded can be determined through simple calculation on integers, without referring to a table, and the address management of the disk is easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Data may not be recorded in the outermost and innermost physical tracks in each zone. This arrangement avoids crosstalk at the boundary between zones. That is the header fields are not necessary aligned radially between different zones, and the header fields and the data fields of tracks adjacent to each other and belonging to different zones may be adjacent to each other. However, by the above arrangement in which the outermost and innermost physical tracks are not used for recording data, the tracks in which data is recorded is separated from the tracks of a different zone, by at least one track in the same zone and in which data is not recorded, so that the crosstalk is substantially eliminated. Degradation in the quality of data or disorder in tracking can therefore be prevented, and the more reliable data recording is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> At least one of said physical data in each zone may be a test track used for adjustment of recording power. With this arrangement, the recording power can be adjusted for each zone, and the reliability of the recording can be further improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Defect management may be effected for each zone. With this arrangement, even where a defective track is found, it can be substituted for by a track within the same zone, and it is not necessary to switch the clock frequency while accessing the substitute track. As a result, address management for controlling the hardware depending on the actual physical location (where the read/write head is accessing), e.g., for switching the clock frequency, and defect management can be achieved in common, so that the address management is achieved with a high speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Each logical track may be composed of 2<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>sectors, with n being an integer. With this arrangement, the addresses of the sectors are represented by consecutive integers, i.e. they are one-dimensional, so that the calculation of the addresses of the sectors is easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An address of each sector may be written 2<highlight><superscript>m </superscript></highlight>times, and an ID may be added to the address at each occurrence to indicate the order of the occurrence. With this arrangement, the addresses each formed of the track address, the sector address and the ID, are linear, or are represented by consecutive integers. Accordingly, the formatter used for formatting such a disk can be formed of a counter. Moreover, the sector addresses can be determined by counting up 2<highlight><superscript>m </superscript></highlight>times. The configuration of the formatter is therefore simple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An address for each sector may comprise a track address and a sector address, or a track address, a sector address and an ID, which are arranged in the stated order from the side of the MSB. The linear address is incremented by one with increase of the sector number. The formatter is therefore formed of a simple up-counter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A predetermined number of bits from the heads of true address for each sector represents a virtual logical track. Since the virtual track address is always the predetermined number of bits, the compatibility with the convention optical disk drive devices is improved. For instance, according to the conventional optical disk standard, the PEP region (phase encoding part where the physical properties of the disk or the conditions under which the writing is to be performed are written) has a region for track addresses of only 16 bits. To be compatible with such a standard, 16 bits from the MSB are taken as the virtual track address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It may be so arranged that an attribute, which is either an attribute indicating a rewritable area, a write-once area or a read-only area, can be independently set for each zone. It is then possible to place different types of areas in a single disk, in various combinations, and disk which best suits to the intended applications can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A difference obtained by subtracting the number of parity tracks of each zone from the number of parity tracks of another zone adjacent to and outside of said each zone is preferably constant. Then, it is possible to determine the number of the parity tracks in each zone without referring to a table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Where a rewritable area and a write-once area are both provided in a single disk, it is preferable that a rewritable area is provided outside of a write-once area. This improves the overall performance of the disk. This is because the rewritable area is more frequently accessed than the write=once area, and the data transfer is rate is higher in the more outward zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an optical disk drive device for use in combination with an optical disk comprising a recording region, physical tracks in said recording region each corresponding to one revolution, said recording region being divided into a plurality of zones by one or more circular boundary lines centered on the center of the disk, each zone comprising a plurality of tracks adjacent to each other, wherein an integer number of sectors are provided in each physical track, the angular recording density is higher in the more outward zones such that the linear recording density is substantially constant throughout the recording region, and logical tracks are formed of a predetermined number of sectors. Independent of the physical tracks, said optical disk drive device determining the logical track address and the sector address responsive to a linear logical address by determining the integral quotient and the remainder by dividing the linear logical by the number of the sectors per logical track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, conversion from the linear logical address supplied from the host device into the logical track and sector addresses can be achieved through simple calculation on integers and without referring to a table, so that the configuration of the drive device of the software for implementing the conversion may be simple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an optical disk drive device for use in combination with an optical disk comprising a recording region, physical tracks in said recording region each corresponding to one revolution, said recording region being divided into a plurality of zones by one or more circular boundary lines centered on the center of the disk, each zone comprising a plurality of tracks adjacent to each other, wherein an integer number of sectors are provided in each physical track, the angular recording density is higher in the more outward zones such that the linear recording density is substantially constant throughout the recording region, and logical tracks are formed of a predetermined number of sectors, independent of the physical tracks, wherein a difference obtained by subtracting the number of the logical tracks corresponding to each zone from the number of the logical tracks corresponding another zone adjacent to and radially outside of said each zone is of a constant value, said optical disk drive device determining the zone containing the target sector on the basis of a product of said constant value and the number of the zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, the zone can be determined through simple calculation on integers and without referring to a table, so that the configuration of the device or the software for implementing the determination of the zone may be simple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an optical disk drive device for use in combination with an optical disk comprising a recording region, physical tracks in said recording region each corresponding to one revolution, said recording region being divided into a plurality of zones by one or more circular boundary lines centered on the center of the disk, each zone comprising a plurality of tracks adjacent to each other, wherein an integer number of sectors are provided in each physical track, the angular recording density is higher in the more outward zones such that the linear recording density is substantially constant throughout the recording region, and logical tracks are formed of a predetermined number of sectors, independent of the physical tracks, said optical disk further comprising a table for recording attributes of the respective zones, said attributes indicating whether each zone is designated as a rewritable area, a write-once area or a read-only area, said table being formed in at least one track or in at least one sector, said optical disk device comprising a means for altering the attributes of the respective zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangment, it is possible to after the rewritable are to a write once area. Such function is desired where the disk or part of the disk is used for storing data that should not be altered without specific permission. It is also possible to alter write-once area to a rewritable area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an optical disk drive device for use in combination with an optical disk comprising a recording region, physical tracks in said recording region each corresponding to one revolution, said recording region being divided into a plurality of zones by one or more circular boundary lines centered on the center of the disk, each zone comprising a plurality of tracks adjacent to each other, wherein an integer number of sectors are provided in each physical track, the angular recording density is higher in the more outward zones such that the linear recording density is substantially constant throughout the recording region, and logical tracks are formed of a predetermined number of sectors, independent of the physical tracks, said optical disk comprising a first part of the recording region designated as a rewritable area and a second part of the recording region designated as a write-once area, said optical disk device comprising a means for permitting access of only rewritable area to a host device, and means for altering an attribute of said second part from the write-once area to the rewritable area and copying the data in said first part to said second part while said host device is not accessing the optical disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With the above arrangement, the host device needs only to provided a single command, e.g., a back-up command. Then, the drive device executes the back-up command by copying the data from one part of the disk to another. In the execution of the command, the attributes of the zones may be altered before and after copying the data. Moreover, the back-up is achieved within a single disk, so that it is not necessary to back-up the data using another disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The optical disk drive device may further comprise means for copying the data in the second part to said first part while said host device is not accessing the optical disk. The host device needs only to provide a single command, e.g., a restore command. Then, the drive device executes the restore command by copying back the data from a write once area to a rewritable area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The optical disk may have recording regions on first and second surfaces opposite to each other. In such a case, it may be desired if the rewritable area is formed on one of the surfaces and the write-once area is formed on the other surface. Then, even when the data on one of the surfaces is destroyed, identical data can be read from the other surface.</paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment, Embodiment 1, will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show the structure of an optical disk of Embodiment 1. A spiral guide groove is formed on an optical disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A light spot <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed bad focusing a light beam from a light source, not shown, onto a land part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between adjacent parts of the guide groove. Each header field <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises a sector address field <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a track address field <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The header fields <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are in the form of pits in the land parts <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed by embossment or stamping when the disk is fabricated. That is, the header fields <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are preformatted. The data fields <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are written magneto-optically. The information in the form of pits in the header fields <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the information magneto-optically recorded in the data fields <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are read by means of the same light beam. Each sector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> comprises a header field <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a data field <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Each of the physical tracks <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> corresponds to one revolution of the optical disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Each physical track <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is composed of an integer number of sectors. A plurality of physical tracks adjacent to each other form a zone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> <highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> <highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>That is, the recording region (user zone) within the recording surfaces of the optical disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is divided into a plurality of zones by concentric boundary circular lines centered on the center of the disk. Each of the physical tracks in the recording region belongs to one of the zones. In the illustrated example, the recording region is divided into 31 zones (from zone No. <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to zone No. <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). The outermost zone No. <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the innermost zone No. <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> each comprise 741 physical tracks, while other zones each comprise 740 physical tracks. The outermost zone No. <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> has the greatest number of sectors, and the more inward zones have a smaller number of sectors. The difference of the number of sectors between the adjacent zones is at least &ldquo;one&rdquo;, and is &ldquo;one&rdquo; in the illustrated example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In use, the disk is rotated at a constant angular velocity regardless of which of the zones the read/write head is accessing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The frequency of the clocks used for recording data in the respective zone is varied or switched so that it is higher in the more outward zones, so that the linear recording density is substantially constant throughout the recording region (user zone) of the disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> During reading, the frequency of the clocks is also switched when the read/write head is moved from one zone to another zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The innermost tracks <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the outermost track <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the zones <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>have field <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and data field <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> adjacent to each other, and have their header fields <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and data field <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> adjacent to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The logical track structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is arranged in the physical structure described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an example in which each sector consists of 1024 bytes. Each logical track is composed of 17 sectors. The marks at the top parts of the respective columns in the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> have the following meanings: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Each revolution group comprises a plurality of sectors. Each revolution group corresponds to each zone. The numbers of logical tracks of the respective revolution groups are determined such that the sectors belonging to the respective revolution groups are substantially equal to the number of the sectors in the corresponding zone. As a result, the starting point and the end point of each revolution group do not necessarily coincide with the starting point and the end point of the corresponding zone, and there may be some offset between them. The deferences (D&Sgr; S) in the rightmost column in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> indicate such offsets, that is, the numbers of sectors which are not in the corresponding zone, but in the next zone. The sectors (12 sectors in the illustrated example) which belong to the last revolution zone, but are not accommodated In the last zone are formed in a spare region, formed inside of the innermost zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The disk within the logical tracks formed as described above, the track address and the sector address written in the header field of each sector corresponds to the linear logical address supplied from a host device. The term &ldquo;linear&rdquo; with respect to the address means that the address are represented by values which are consecutive integers. Accordingly, the sector address and the track address are determined through simple calculation on integers. Although the number of sectors per evolution differs from one zone to another, this need not be taken account in the above calculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the physical location of the sector on the disk can be determined from the logical track address and the sector address through simple calculation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 2, will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a part of the optical disk of Embodiment 2, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a table showing a physical track structure of the optical disk of Embodiment 2. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in the vicinity of the boundary of adjacent zones, at least one physical track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. 15 of each of the adjacent zones are designated as guard tracks, which the user cannot use for recording data. In addition, at least one physical track <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in each zone is designated as a test track, which the user cannot use for recording data. In the illustrated example, the innermost physical track in each zone is designated as a guard track <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an outermost physical track is designated as the test track <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the physical track next to the outermost guard track <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is designated as another guard track <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The guard tracks <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are for avoiding crosstalk near the boundary between the adjacent zones. The guard tracks are assigned addresses independent of the addresses of the data recording sectors, and the addresses of the guard tracks are beyond the range of the addresses assigned to the sectors for recording data. This will ensure that the guard tracks are not accessed during recording or reading data, and the guard tracks are therefore not used for recording data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The test track <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is used for adjustment of the recording power. For instance, when the drive device is turned on, test data is recorded on the test track, with a given recording power, and is then reproduced, and the error occurrence rate is determined. The recording power is then varied In accordance with the determined error rate, and the recording is again made with the varied recording power. The above process is repeated until the error rate becomes sufficiently low. The recording power is thereby optimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Designating the physical track between the guard tracks <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of each boundary between zones as the test track <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is advantageous because, with such an arrangement, even when excessive power is used for recording in the test track this does not affect the tracks used for recording. However, any other track may alternatively be designated as the test track, as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The test tracks <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are assigned addresses independent of the addresses of the data recording sectors, and the addresses of the test tracks are beyond the range of the addresses assigned to the sectors for recording data. This will ensure that the guard tracks are not accessed during recording or reading data, and the guard tracks are therefore not used for recording data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The tracks other than the guard tracks and the test track are used for recording data, and each logical track is formed of 17 sectors. The numbers of the logical tracks in the respective revolution groups are determined so that the difference in the number of the logical tracks between the adjacent revolution groups is a constant value, which in the illustrated example is &ldquo;43&rdquo;. With such an arrangement, the number of the logical tracks can be determined through simple calculation on integers, and management using a table or the like is unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the logical track structure of Embodiment 2. It is similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. However, the number of the physical tracks in each of the zones No. <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and No. <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is 740, which is the same as the number of logical tracks in each of the other zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the marks which are at the top parts of the respective columns and which are identical to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> have the same meanings as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. &ldquo;G&plus;T&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> denote the number of sectors in the guard tracks and the test track in the zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Embodiment 2 has an advantage over Embodiment 1 with regard to the following points: First, in Embodiment 1, the end point of the last logical track in each revolution group does not coincide with the end point of the zone, and some sectors are in the next zone, and the number of such sectors in the next zone is not constant. In such a case, the switching of the clocks must be controlled in the logical track. It is therefore necessary to perform management over substitution (for accessing the spare sectors in place of defect sectors), and the management over control related to the actual physical arrangement (e.g., the switching of the clocks). Secondly, crosstalks between adjacent tracks may occur near the zone boundaries. Thirdly, adjustment of power using a test track cannot be made. Furthermore, there is no rule or regularity on the number of logical tracks in the respective revolution groups, so that it is necessary to provide a table storing the number of logical tracks in each revolution group, and this table needs to be referred to for the conversion from the logical address to the physical address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The logical track structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> solves the problem discussed above. The logical tracks of each revolution are all accommodated in the corresponding zone. Moreover, by the provision of the guard tracks, the crosstalks at the zone boundary is eliminated. Furthermore, the recording power can be adjusted using the test track. In addition, since the difference in the number of logical tracks between adjacent revolution groups is constant, conversion from the logical address to the physical address can be achieved by simple calculation, and does not require a table. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 3, will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. It is similar to Embodiment 2. but differs from it in the following respects: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> With the format of the logical track of Embodiment 2, the number of sectors remaining in each revolution group after assigning the required number of tracks for data recording differs from one track to another. As a result, it is necessary to record the number of the remaining sectors in a table and refer to it in determining the physical location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the logical track structure for solving the above problem. The marks which are at the top parts of the respective columns and which are identical to those in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> have the same meanings as those in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. &ldquo;DUM&rdquo; denotes the number of sectors remaining after assigning the logical tracks, &ldquo;&Dgr;DUM&rdquo; denotes the difference in DUM between adjacent zones, and &ldquo;RES&rdquo; denotes the sum of DUM and G&plus;T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the difference in the number of the logical tracks, LT/G, between adjacent revolution groups is of a constant number, e.g., <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and the three physical tracks are reserved for the guard tracks and the zest track, and the number of the remaining sectors, DUM, is of a constant number, e.g., &ldquo;6&rdquo; in the illustrated example. Accordingly, the physical location of the sector can be determined through calculation using a formula in which the number of the remaining sectors, DUM, is incorporated, and it is not necessary to provide a table storing the number of remaining sectors of the respective revolution groups, which were necessary when the number of the remaining sectors differ from one revolution group to another. </paragraph>

This embodiment is identical to Embodiment 2, except that the number of the physical tracks per revolution group and the number of the revolution groups within the recording region of the disk differ from those of Embodiment 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The format of the logical tracks of Embodiment 3 solved the problems of Embodiments 1 and 2, and the number of the remaining sectors is a positive number, so that the logical tracks do not bridge adjacent zones. Moreover, the physical location of a target sector can be determined through calculation on integers, without referring to a table. However, the remaining sectors in which no data is recorded exist. The capacity of the disk is not fully utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> shows logical track structures for solving the above problems of Embodiment 3. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a case in which each sector consists of 1024 bytes, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a case in which each sector consists of 512 bytes. In each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, the total number of sectors in each revolution group corresponds to an integer number of logical tracks, and the difference in the number of logical tracks between adjacent revolution groups is a constant number, which is &ldquo;176&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, or &ldquo;54&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated examples, no guard and test tracks are provided. However, they may be provided in the same way as in Embodiment 3. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 5, will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, each sector consists of 1024 bytes. The structure of the disk is identical to that shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, but the header field of each sector differs from that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it has two header sections <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Each of the header sections <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>comprises a track address field <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a sector address field <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and an ID field <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Identical addresses are recorded in the track address fields <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the sector address fields <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the two header sections <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The addresses indicate the sector of which the header sections <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>form a part. The identical addresses are written in duplicate in order to improve the reliability. A binary &ldquo;0&rdquo; is written in the ID field <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the first header section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and a binary &ldquo;1&rdquo; is written in the ID field <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the second header section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The ID field <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> In each header section <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>thereby identifies the header section. i.e., whether it is the first header section or the second header section in each sector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows the logical track structure. The marks which are at the top parts of the respective columns and which ate identical to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 7</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> have the same meanings as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. &ldquo;S/LT&rdquo; denotes the number of sectors per logical track. The arrangement of the tracks as shown is generally identical to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> but differs from that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in the following respects. First, the number of zones is not <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, but is <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each zone has 752 physical tracks. Each logical track has 2<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>sectors. In the illustrated example n&equals;4 so that 2<highlight><superscript>n</superscript></highlight>&equals;2<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>&equals;16 sectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the track address field <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed of 16 bits, and is used to represent an address value of from &ldquo;0&rdquo; to &ldquo;22560&rdquo;, and the sector address field <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed of 4 bits and is used to represent an address value of from &ldquo;0&rdquo; to &ldquo;15&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As has been described, since the track address is represented by 2<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>or 16 bits, calculation of the track address is easy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 6 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 6, will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. Each sector consists of 1024 bytes, like Embodiment 5. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, each of the zones Nos. <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> comprises 768 physical tracks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and each logical track consists of 128 sectors. Addresses are written in duplicate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows header sections <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The track address <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is composed of 16 bits and is used to represent a value or from &ldquo;0&rdquo; to &ldquo;23040&rdquo;. The sector address <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is composed of 7 bits and is used to represent a value of from &ldquo;0&rdquo; to &ldquo;127&rdquo;. The ID field is composed of a single bit and is used to represent &ldquo;0&rdquo; or &ldquo;1&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> With the arrangement of the logical tracks described above, the track address and sector address read from the disk correspond directly (as is) to the linear logical address from a host device, and the actual track and sector addresses can be determined through simple calculation on integers. Moreover, any difference in the number of sectors per revolution need not be taken account of. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 7 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 7. will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference>. This embodiment relates to an optical disk drive device, and in particular to its operation for accessing the target sector on an optical disk having been loaded onto the drive device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows an optical disk drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> used for writing in and reading from optical disks, and a host device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connected to the optical disk drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The optical disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is actually loaded in the optical disk device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> but is shown to be placed outside the device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for the sake of convenience of illustration. The host device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provides commands for writing on or reading from the optical disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, together with the designation of the address on or from which the writing or reading is to be conducted. The address is a linear address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Upon receipt of such a command, the drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> performs the operation for seeking the track in which the sector corresponding to the designated address as located. The operation for writing and reading is known, and its description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows the seek operation. The drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> first reads the logical track address of the currently-accessed track, i.e., the logical track which the read/write head of the optical disk drive device is now confronting or accessing(<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). Then, on the basis of the track number having been read, the zone to which the currently-accessed logical track belongs, is identified, that is the zone number is determined (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). Then, the physical location of the logical track of which the address has been read is determined (<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). Then, the linear logical address from the host device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is converted into the logical track address (<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). Then, the zone number of the zone to which the target logical track belongs is determined (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). Then, the physical location of the target sector is determined (<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). Then, the number of physical tracks which lie between and the currently-accessed track and the target position, i.e., which have to be traversed for the seek operation, is determined, taking into consideration the zone number (<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>). Then, the head is moved for traversing the number of physical tracks, that is determined to lie between the currently-accessed track and the target position (<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>). The above operation is repeated until the target track is reached (<highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> When the head arrives at the target track, the addresses in the respective sectors are read, to find out the target sector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Using the optical disks of the above embodiments exhibit advantages in the above-described seek operation. For instance, if a disk of any of Embodiments 1, 2 an 3 is used, the conversion at the step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is accomplished by simple calculation: That is, the logical track address At and the logical sector address As are given as the integral quotient and the remainder of the division:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>A<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>/(S/LT)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> wherein S/LT is the number of sectors per logical track, and A<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>is the linear logical address from the host device. Accordingly, the table for the conversion of the address is not necessary and the configuration of the drive device and/or the software for implementing the seek operation is simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> An additional advantage obtained a disk of Embodiment 2 is used that the determination of the zone number at the step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and at the step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is made using the following relationship</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>ZN&times;&lcub;LF/G</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>ZN&equals;0</subscript></highlight>&plus;(<highlight><italic>LT/G</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>ZN&equals;0</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&minus;&Dgr;LT/G&times;zN</italic></highlight>)&rcub;/2&equals;17<highlight><italic>&times;At</italic></highlight>&plus;(the number of remaining sectors as stored in the table)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> where LT/G<highlight><subscript>ZN&equals;0 </subscript></highlight>is the number of the logical tracks in the zone No <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. The table needs only to store the number of the remaining sectors, which are relatively small figures. Therefore, the required size of the table is small, and the configuration of the device or the software for implementing the seek operation is simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> An additional advantage obtained if a disk of Embodiment 3 is used is that the determination of the zone number at the step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and at the step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is made using the following relationship:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>ZN&times;&lcub;LF/G</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>ZN&equals;0</subscript></highlight>&plus;(<highlight><italic>LT/G</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>ZN&equals;0</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&minus;&Dgr;LT/G&times;ZN</italic></highlight>)&rcub;/2&equals;17<highlight><italic>&times;At</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Thus, the correction using the number of remaining sectors as stored in the table is not required. It is therefore not necessary to provide such a table for the determination of the zone number at the step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>r <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 8 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 8, will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>. This embodiment relates to an optical disk drive device, and in particular to its operation for adjusting the power of the laser beam used for writing. Such adjustment is conducted prior to the actual writing, e.g., when the drive device is turned on. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the function of the drive device. As illustrated, the drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which may be connected to a host device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, comprises a controller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> provided with a CPU, a ROM and a RAM, a recording circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a laser controller <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a read/write head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with a built-in semiconductor laser, a reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and an evaluation circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is responsive to commands from the host device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for sending control signals to various parts of the device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to conduct the writing power adjustment. It outputs a designation of the initial value of the writing power. The recording circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> conducts recording of test data responsive to the control signals from the controller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. That is, it provides the test data used for the recording for the purpose of power adjustment. The laser controller <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> modulates the test data supplied from the recording circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and supplies the modulated test data to the read/write head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. It sets the laser power to the initial value designated by the controller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The read/write head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> records the test data on the disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with the power that is set by the laser controller <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The read/write head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> also reads the test data having been recorded. The reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> demodulates the test data read by the read/write head <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The evaluation circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> evaluates the fidelity of the reproduced data with respect to the test data output from the recording circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. That is, it determines the error rate in the reproduced data, and evaluates the quality of reproduced data. On the basis of the evaluation, the controller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> varies the set value of the writing power. The above described steps are repeated to obtain the optimum writing power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows the above-described procedure for determining the optimum writing power. First an initial value of the writing power is set (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>), and the writing is conducted with the initial value (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). Then, the test data having been written is reproduced (<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>). Then, the quality of the reproduced data is evaluated (<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). If the quality is found satisfactory, the process is terminated. If not, judgement is made whether the power is too large or too small (<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). If the power is found too large, the set value of the power lowered (<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>). If the power is found too small, the set value is raised (<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>). Then, the process is returned to the step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The above-described steps are repeated until the quality of the reproduced data is found satisfactory. </paragraph>

The parity tracks are used to record parity symbols when the zone is designated as O-ROM type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the recording region is divided into 30 zones, zone Nos. <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Each zone consists of 748 physical tracks. The number of the logical tracks in each zone can be determined by dividing the number of sectors in the zone by 17. The number of the parity tracks varies from 144 to 86 with the increase of the zone number from 0 to 29, the difference between the adjacent zones being two. To determine the number of the parity tracks for each zone, it is only necessary to decrement by two. Such determination can be made by simple calculation on integers, and no table need be referred to for this calculation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 10 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 10, will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. As described earlier, the disk is rotated at a constant angular velocity in use, and the frequency of the clocks used for recording and reading is switched depending on the zone in which the read/write head is accessing. Where the disk contains the R/W type zone or zones, the WO type zone or zones, and the O-ROM type zone or zones, the R/W zone or zones are placed in the outermost part of the disk, the O-ROM type zone or zones are placed in the innermost part of the disk and the WO type zone or zones are placed in the intermediate part of the disk, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. The reason is that the data transfer rate is higher in the more outward zones, so that the more outward zones are assigned for the type of the recording zones which are more frequently accessed. In the above described situation, the R/W type is most frequency accessed because three types of operations, i.e., reading, writing and erasing operations are performed, so that the outermost part of the disk is allocated to the R/W type zones. The WO type zone or zones are accessed more frequently than the O-ROM type because the former once. The W/O type zones are therefore placed more outward than the O-ROM type zones. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 11, will next be described witch reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The disk is basically of the sane structure as that of the Embodiment 10, but it only contains the R/W type zone or zones and the WO type zone or zones. The R/W type zone or zones are placed more outward than the W/O type zone or zones, because R/W zones are more frequently accessed. </paragraph>

The disk is basically of the same structure as that of the Embodiment 10, but it only contains the WO type zone or zones and the O-ROM type zone or zones. The WO type zone or zones are placed more outward than the O-ROM type zone or zones, because the former-permits writing operation, although only once. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 13 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 13, will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. This embodiment relates to an optical disk drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which alters the attributes of the zones in the manner described below. The drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is connected to a host device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by an interface such as SCS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The optical disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is loaded in the drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, but is shown to be placed outside the drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for convenience of illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the recording region is entirely of the R/W type when fabricated. However, the area denoted as &ldquo;vacant&rdquo; is initially inaccessible. The drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has the function of altering the attributes of, the zones written in the management table. This function is performed by executing a command A. When the drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> receives the command A from the host device <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the attributes of the zones designated by the command A are altered to &ldquo;WO&rdquo;. At the same time, the zones which have been inaccessible are altered to accessible R/W zones (as indicated by B). The zones having been altered to WO type permits writing of data once, and after that the data cannot be altered. That is this part is now like ROM type part. The R/W part, which have been altered from inaccessible part, now permits writing and reading. Thus, a disk having the same function as P-ROM is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The alteration of the attributes can be made by the user, and the attributes having been altered to WO may be returned to R/W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the disk of this embodiment is lower cost in some applications. P-ROM disks with their ROM part formed by embossment is expensive where the number of the disk produced at the same time is limited because of the relatively high cost of fabricating the original disk. In contrast, the disks formed in the above manner are less expensive and yet have the same function as P-ROM disks having embossed part </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 15 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 15, will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. This embodiment also relates to an optical disk drive device capable of altering the attributes of the zones and executing a back-up command. Description of the parts identical to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is omitted. The attributes of the zones are written in the management table <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. AS illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, alternate zones are designated as R/W zones and intervening zones are designated as W/O zones. The total capacity of the WO zones is about the same as the total capacity of the R/W zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> A procedure for control for executing a back-up command is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. First, when the drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> receives the command from a host device (<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>), it determines whether it is an inquiry on capacity, a read/write command, or a back-up command (<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). If it is the inquiry, the an answer indicating the capacity of the R/W area is sent to the host device (<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>). If it is the read/write command (<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>), judgement is then made whether the read/write head is accessing an R/W area (<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>), and if the answer is affirmative, the command is executed (<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>). If it is the back-up command (<highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>), a message indicating that the execution of the command is completed is sent to the host device (<highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>), and the data in the R/W area is copied into the WO area (<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>), when it is found that the host device is not accessing. If necessary, the attributes of the zones are altered to &ldquo;R/W&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>) prior to the copying, and returned to &ldquo;WO&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>) after the copying. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the back-up command is indicated by E, and the alteration of the attributes in the table is indicated by F and H, and the copying of the data is indicated by G. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Embodiment 16 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment, Embodiment 16, will next be described. This embodiment also relates to an optical disk drive device capable of altering the attributes of the zones. The embodiment is similar to Embodiment 15. The optical disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> permits recording on both sides or surfaces. The drive device <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has the function of reading from and writing on both surfaces of the disk without turning the disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> upside down. A first surface is entirely an R/W area, while a second surface is entirely a WO area. By the same procedure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the back-up command is executed. That is, responsive to a back-up command (I), the attributes of the second surface is altered to R/W (J), the data on the first surface is copied to the second surface (K), and the attributes of the second surface is returned to (L). Because the second surface is returned to WO after the copying, the data having been copied into the second surface is not destroyed by a device which does not have the function of altering the attribute. </paragraph>
