<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention is related generally to a power-actuated surgical tool with a handle-mounted self-sealing switch assembly. One particular version of this tool is an electrosurgical tool that has handle-mounted switches, is relatively easy to manufacture, provides an indication if fluid penetrates its handle and that has tip that fosters fluid circulation adjacent the surgical site to which it is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention is also related generally to a system and method of shrinking capsulary tissue and, more particularly, to a system and method for shrinking capsulary tissue by applying heat, thermal energy, to the tissue. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Electrosurgical tools have been used for a number of years to cut and shape tissue at the surgical sites to which these tools are applied. A typical electrosurgical tool has an elongated shaft, sometimes called a &ldquo;probe,&rdquo; with a handle at one end and a tip at the opposed end. One type of electrode surgical tool available to surgeons is referred to as a bipolar electrosurgical tool. An active electrode is fitted into the tip of this tool. The shaft of the bipolar electrosurgical tool functions as the return or reference electrode. The tool is applied to a surgical site at which there is a saline solution, a conductive fluid. A voltage is applied at a very high frequency, 50 k Hz to 10 M Hz, from the active electrode to the adjacent end of the shaft. This signal flows through, arcs through, the saline solution and the body tissue against which the tip is applied. When the signal is at a relatively low power, typically under 40 Watts, the signal can coagulate fluid such as blood to seal the tissue closed. When the signal is at a relatively high power, typically 20 Watts or more, it vaporizes the tissue to which it is applied so as to ablate, remove, the tissue. The overlap in the power ranges between the coagulation and ablation modes of operation is due to the fact that, for a given power setting, whether or not a particular electrode coagulates or ablates tissue is also a factor of the size and shape of the head of the electrode. Often, when an electrosurgical tool is used to ablate tissue, it is considered to be operated in the &ldquo;cutting&rdquo; mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Many currently available electrosurgical tools are designed so that mounted to the handles are switches for regulating the on/off state of the tool and the mode in which the tool is operated. The mounting of these switches to the tool handle makes it possible for the surgeon to, with a single hand, control both the position of the tool and the operation of the tool. The switches are typically mounted to the tool handle in liquid-tight seal assemblies. This mounting is necessary to prevent the conductive liquid that is often present in a surgical environment from entering the handle and shorting out any electrical components therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Presently available electrosurgical tools work reasonably well for the purposes for which they are designed. However, there are still some limitations associated with the currently available tools. Some of these limitations are due to the fact that, when an electrosurgical tool is operated in the ablation mode, bubbles form on the surface of the active electrode. One reason these bubbles form is that the electrical energy discharged by the electrode heats the conductive saline solution that surrounds the electrode. The heating of this solution causes it to vaporize and form bubbles. Initially, when relatively low levels of heat are present, the fluid immediately adjacent the surface of the electrode is subjected to thin film boiling and transitional boiling. In this type of vaporization, relatively small bubbles of gaseous state solution form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, when additional thermal or electromagnetic energy is radiated from the surface of the active electrode, the adjacent saline solution is subjected to rapid nucleate boiling. During nucleate boiling, relatively large bubbles of vaporized solution form on the surface of the electrode. These bubbles are sometimes referred to as gas pockets. Moreover, during some high powered cutting modes of operation, the electrical current applied to the solution and surrounding tissue causes electrochemical processes to occur in this tissue and liquid. These electrochemical processes produce gaseous state products that contribute the formation of large bubbles and the gas pockets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> At a minimum, these bubbles are a nuisance. The presence of these bubbles interferes with the surgeon&apos;s view of the surgical site. This is especially a problem when the electrosurgical tool is employed in an endoscopic surgical procedure. In an endoscopic procedure, the electrosurgical tool is applied to the surgical site through a small opening formed in the patient&apos;s body known as a portal. The surgeon views the surgical site through an endoscope that is directed to the surgical site through another portal. An advantage of an endoscopic surgical procedure in comparison to a conventional surgical procedure is that it requires less of the patient&apos;s body to be opened up in order to gain access to the surgical site. However, when a conventional electrosurgical tool is employed in an endoscopic surgical procedure, the bubbles generated in the relatively small confines of the space of the surgical site can significantly block the surgeon&apos;s view of the site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, these bubbles are electrically and thermally insulating. The large bubbles that form gas pockets during high powered cutting can inhibit the flow of new solution that rewets the electrode. Consequently, the bubbles reduce the extent to which current can arc through the tissue that is to be ablated. Sometimes, these bubbles significantly reduce current flow through the tissue. The current flow stays in the reduced state until the bubbles collapse or move away and the saline solution or body fluid flows back into the space between the electrode and the shaft. Thus, sometimes when a presently available electrosurgical tool is actuated, the current only flows in a pulse pattern through the tissue to be ablated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Moreover, many current electrosurgical tools are provided with wire wound electrodes. It is difficult to form wire wound electrodes so that they have heads with shapes that are especially useful for performing electrosurgical procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Providing a seal around the handle switches can significantly add to the overall cost and assembly of the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Also, sometimes, even with the best seals, there may be liquid leakage into the handle of an electrosurgical tool. This leakage, if not promptly detected, at a minimum, can lead to the degradation of the tool performance. In a worse case scenario, this leakage can cause a conductive path to develop along the outer surface of the handle. If this occurs, the personnel handling the tool may be subjected to electrical shock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Still another method by which an electrosurgical tool is employed to shape, remove very selected amounts of tissue is by a capsulary shrinkage procedure. In a capsulary shrinkage procedure, the cells forming soft tissue are desiccated, reduced in size. In this type of procedure, as a result of the heating of the active electrode, there is a conductive transfer of the heat from the electrode to the location at which the capsulary shrinkage of tissue is to occur. The thermal energy applied to the site causes the cells forming the tissue at the site to undergo capsulary shrinkage. This process is referred to as a thermally capsulary shrinkage procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a presently available electrosurgical tool, internal to the tip or distal end of the shaft there may be a small thermistor or other temperature-sensitive transducer. This transducer monitors the temperature of the active electrode to inferentially provide an indication of the temperature of the surgical site. This temperature data is very important because there is a limited temperature range to which tissue can be heated in order to foster its shrinkage without causing damage to the tissue. More particularly thermal capsulary shrinkage of tissue is best performed by heating the tissue to a temperature between 60 and 70&deg; C. If the tissue is heated to a temperature above this range, it may suffer damage. More particularly, the cells forming the tissue may die if heated to a temperature above 70&deg; C. Therefore, when a thermal capsulary procedure is now performed, the temperature of the active electrode is monitored in order to regulate the application of an energization voltage to the electrode. Specifically, the application of the energization voltage to the active electrode is controlled to maintain its temperature within the range at which the thermal capsulary shrinkage process can best occur and to prevent it from rising to level at which cell death or damage can occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> One disadvantage of the presently available electrosurgical tools is that the transducer internal to the tool only measures the temperature of the adjacent active electrode. This temperature measurement is only an approximate measurement of the temperature at the site to which the electrode is applied. Given the presence of fluids and other material around the active electrode and, more particularly, between the transducer and the surgical site, this measurement may not accurately represent the temperature at the site to which the electrode is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Still another disadvantage associated with the currently available electrosurgical tool relates to the fact that often an AC signal is used to energize the active electrode. This signal generates stray electromagnetic waves. These electromagnetic waves interfere with the generation of the output signal generated by the transducer. Accordingly, it is now common practice to energize an electrosurgical tool in an on/off/on/off pulsed pattern. During time periods when the energization signal is pulsed on, the transducer signal is not employed as a feedback signal since it is adversely affected by the stray electromagnetic waves. Only during the time periods at which the energization signal is pulsed off, and the transducer signal is relatively noise free, is the signal then employed by the downline components as the input signal for regulating the application of energy to the active electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> One disadvantage of this mechanism is that the pulsing of current through the active electrode may stress the material from which the electrode is formed. Another disadvantage of this process is that the pulsing causes the thermal energy generated by the electrode to itself be generated in an on/off/on/off pattern. The cyclic generation of this heat can cause it to be unevenly applied to the surgical site. The uneven application of this heat can in turn both make it difficult to control the application of heat and lengthen the time it takes to perform the desired thermal capsulary shrinkage procedure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> This invention is related generally to a new and useful electrosurgical tool. The tool of this invention has a tip assembly with an electrode that facilitates the flow of conductive fluid to constantly rewet the active electrode during low powered operation as well as the eduction of large bubbles/gas pockets away from electrode during higher powered operation. More specifically, the tip assembly is designed to foster convective fluid circulation around the surfaces of the electrode that constantly rewets those surfaces and transports the larger bubbles away from the electrode. This circulation also serves to clean debris away from the electrode. In order to foster this fluid flow, the electrode and a complementary insulator of the tip assembly of this invention are formed with portals through which this fluid flows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The tool of this invention also has a handle, a nose cone, in which the circuitry internal to the tool is mounted on a printed circuit board. A leak detect circuit is located on the periphery of the printed circuit board. A complementary control console continually monitors the signal from this leak detect circuit. The switches integral with the nose cone include static components that are mounted on the printed circuit board. The switches have moving components that are integrally formed on a web that is fitted to the nose cone. The web is designed to self-seal into place when mounted to the nose cone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In some versions, the tool of this invention also has a fiber optic cable that is fitted in the tool shaft and that extends proximally away from the tip. The fiber optic cable terminates at a transducer that is sensitive to infra-red light. The transducer, based on the quantity of the received light, generates an electrical signal representative of the temperature at the surgical site. The output signal generated by the transducer is applied to the control unit that regulates the application of the output power signal to the tool electrodes. The control unit uses the transducer output signal as a feedback signal for regulating the magnitude of the energization signal applied to the electrodes.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> depict the basic electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention. The tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an elongated shell-like nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that serves as the handle for the tool. Extending forward from the front end of the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed from conductive metal. (In this application, &ldquo;front&rdquo;, &ldquo;forward&rdquo; and &ldquo;distal&rdquo; shall be understood to mean towards the surgical site to which the tool is applied. &ldquo;Rear&rdquo;, &ldquo;rearwardly&rdquo; and &ldquo;proximal&rdquo; shall be understood to mean away from the surgical site.) Substantially all of the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, except for its distal end, is covered by an insulating tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extends forward from the distal end of shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is housed in the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. More precisely, electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is considered an active electrode and the exposed distal end of shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> functions as a return or reference electrode. When the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is actuated, current flows from electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the exposed end of shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The current either coagulates or ablates the tissue against which the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is placed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The current for energizing the electrosurgical tool comes from a control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Current flows from console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through a detachable cable <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> converts the line voltage into a high frequency signal suitable for applying across the tool electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Depending on the surgeon&apos;s commands, the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> applies either a low power coagulation-causing signal to electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or a high powered, ablation-causing signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The actual power of the signal generated by the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is also a function of the type of electrosurgical tool that is attached to the console as will be discussed hereinafter. Also, the surgeon is capable of setting the power to a specific level. For example, based on the depression of either an up switch <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or a down switch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the face of the console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> the surgeon can, respectively, raise and lower the power setting of the tool when the tool is operated in the cutting mode. A display <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> indicates the cutting mode power level at which the electrosurgical is set to operate. By depressing a low power button <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a medium power button <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or a high power button <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on the face of the console, the surgeon can control which one-of-three power levels the tool is operated at when it is operated in the coagulation mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The actual on/off actuation of the electrosurgical tool is controlled by two normally-open switches <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> mounted to the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When the surgeon wants to operate the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the cutting mode, he/she depresses switch <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. When the surgeon wants to operate the electrosurgical tool in the coagulation mode, he/she depresses switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A surgeon may alternatively control the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a foot switch assembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Foot switch assembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a set of depressible foot switches <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that respectively, can be depressed to perform that same functions as are performed by up switch <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, down switch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, cutting-on switch <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and coagulation-on switch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The portion of the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to which the cable <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is attached is a hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which is the most rearwardly positioned portion of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed from a plastic such as PVC or ABS. The hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, now described in detail by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, is generally shaped to have a forward extending inner shell <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is seated inside the open rear end of the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An outer shell <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is located around the exposed rear end of the inner shell <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Small ribs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extend between the inner and outer shells <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, respectively, to provide stability to the outer shell. The outer shell <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is the exposed portion of the hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a solid, cylindrical core <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that extends from the end of the hub forward axially through the inner shell <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Supports <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that extend between the core <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and inner shell <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> hold the core in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Socket pins <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> seated in the core <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> receive pins integral with the cable <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, (cable pins not illustrated). Each socket pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is seated in a separate through bore <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that extends through the core <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> along an axis that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bore. The core <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is formed so that the rear end of each bore <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has an outwardly chamfered section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. This shaping of the bores <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> facilitates the insertion of the socket pins <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> into the bores. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> it can be seen that each socket pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has first and second sections <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, respectively. Each first section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is generally sleeve shaped and is designed to receive a wire that is crimped in place. The pin first section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is the portion of the pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> seated in the bore <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The pin second section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is sleeve like and further formed to have a slit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that runs approximately the length of the section. The pin second section is the portion of the pin that extends rearwardly out of the hub core <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The second section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is the portion of the pin that receives the complementary pin integral with cable <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. One suitable socket pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is manufactured by AMP, Inc. of Harrisburg, Pa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It will be further noted that, in the depicted version of the invention, a small post <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with the core <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and extends rearwardly from the end of the core. Post <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> prevents the socket pins <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> from being inadvertently bent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, now described by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, is formed from a plastic such as PVC or ABS. The nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a generally elongated shape. The front end of the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shaped to have an inwardly directed taper. Shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and insulating tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extend out of the front end of the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The front end of the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is generally solid. Nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is further formed to have a void space <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that extends from approximately the longitudinal mid point of the nose cone to the open rear end of the nose cone. The hub inner shell <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> seats extends into the open rear end of the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and seats in the adjacent portion of void space <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is further formed to have a bore <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that extends rearwardly from the front tip of the nose cone. Bore <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> extends rearwardly from the front of the nose cone into void space <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The bore <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is the space within the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in which the rear end of shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is seated. In the depicted version of the invention, nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed so that the forward portion of bore <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is actually a counterbore <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that has a diameter that is slightly wider than that of the remaining, rearwardly extending portion of the bore. Counterbore <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is provided to provide a space inside the nose cone for accommodating the rearward section of the insulating tube <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> this fitted around shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is further formed to have an opening in the top of the cone that serves as a wiring space <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The wiring space <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is the space inside the nose cone in which a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is mounted. The wiring space <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> extends from a point rearward and above counterbore <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to a point over void space <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A passageway <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> connects the wiring space <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to void space <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Wires <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> from the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> extend through passageway <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> so that they can be connected to the socket pins <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> integral with hub <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The nose cone is also shaped to have a flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that extends upwardly from the base of wiring space <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is in the form of a closed-loop that is generally rectangularly shaped and that has rounded corners. Flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> serves as the member internal to nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for supporting the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. There are two opposed posts <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> located immediately inside the front and rear ends of the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Posts <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which extend a slight distance above the top edge of flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, serves as the structural elements to which the printed wiring board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is snap fitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the depicted version of the invention, nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is also formed to have a boss <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> that extends upwardly from the base of wiring space <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and that is located immediately rearward of the forward wall of flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Boss <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is formed with a conduit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> that extends from the top of the boss into bore <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In some preferred methods of manufacturing the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention, shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are fitted in place within bore <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and counterbore <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Then, an adhesive is injected into bore <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and counterbore <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> through conduit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. This adhesive at least partially fills bore <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> so as to secure the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and sleeve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, is formed from any conventional substrate material from which printed circuit boards are formed. The top surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is formed to have two conductive traces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> that are arranged in one location to form a contact pad <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> for switch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A branch of conductive trace <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, in combination with a third conductive trace <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, are arranged at a second location on the printed circuit board to form a contact pad <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for switch <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> also has a fourth conductive trace <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> extends between trace <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and trace <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> serves as an identification member that identifies the particular type of electrosurgical tool. In one preferred version of the invention, when the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> becomes part of a voltage divider <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>), the rest of which is internal to the control console. A voltage measuring circuit <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> internal to the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> measures the voltage across the resistor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This voltage indicates to the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> the power levels of the signals that should be applied to the electrosurgical tool attached to the console. The console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, based on this indication, applies an energization signal appropriate for the type of tool to the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> It will further be observed that conductive trace <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is arranged on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> so that a branch <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the trace extends around the outer perimeter of the board. Conductive trace <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is arranged so that it is in close proximity to the portions of conductive trace <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that form contact pads <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In particular, it will be observed that conductive trace <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> defines at least 90&deg; of the perimeter of each contact pad <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Trace <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is parallel to the portions of the trace <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that define the perimeter of the contact pads. More particularly trace <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is spaced a maximum of 30 mils (0.030 inches) and preferably 20 mils or less away from the portions of trace <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that define the perimeter of the contact pads <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The purpose of this arrangement will be explained hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, formed of elastomeric material such as silicon rubber covers the nose cone wiring space <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is shaped to have a generally flat base section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that substantially covers the wiring space <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. A lip <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extends perpendicularly downwardly from the perimeter of base section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and surrounds the base section. The lip <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed to have a slit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that is extends downwardly from a position located in the middle of the lip and that extends circumferentially around the web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is further formed so that ribs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> extend the inner wall of the lip <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to be compression fitted into wiring space <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the lip <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is designed to tightly fit, compression secure, into the space between the outer wall of nose cone flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the walls internal to the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that define the outer perimeter of wiring space <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. When the web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is so fitted in place, the web ribs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> collapse inwardly. When the web is so positioned, it also serves to hold the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is further shaped to have two flexible buttons <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that are integrally formed with base section <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>.

Button <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is the moving component of switch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and is positioned over contact pad <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Each button <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is formed so that the undersurface thereof, the surface facing the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, functions as a landing pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Each landing pad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is formed from graphite or other material to make the landing pad conductive. In some versions of the invention, the conductive material is a copper disk or copper paint that is applied to the underside of the button. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As seen by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is generally in the form of an elongated hollow tube. Typically, the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed from stainless steel. Shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is further formed so as to have a small window <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that is located immediately forward of the proximal end of the shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> When the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention is assembled, an insulated wire <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> through which current is supplied to electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fed into the center of shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through window <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. An insulated wire <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is employed to serve as the reference/return conductor from shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An exposed end <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of wire <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is placed in the proximal end of the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The proximal end of the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is then crimped down over the wire so as to mechanically and electrically connect wire <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to the shaft. Typically, this crimping is performed by an automated tool with fingers that simultaneously presses different arcuate sections of the shaft inward towards the wire and against each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As a result of this crimping, the crushed portions of the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> form an longitudinally extending slot <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>. The portion of wire <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> that extends out of window <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is seated in slot <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. It will further be observed that as a result of this crimping of the proximal end of shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the end of the shaft and as well as the section of wire <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> seated in slot <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, subtend a space less than the diameter of the rest of the shaft, (diameter shown in phantom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>). Thus, after this crimping operation, the crimped end of the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can still be fitted in nose cone bore <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> generically illustrates a tip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of this invention, how these components are mounted in shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and how wire <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is connected to the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The tip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes an insulating sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> formed from an appropriate material. In some versions of the invention, sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is formed from a ceramic such as yttrium tetragonally stabilized zirconium oxide. The sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> has an elongated base <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> that is seated in the open distal end of shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is further formed to have a head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, with a diameter equal to the outside diameter of shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is integral with base <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The sleeve head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> abuts the open end of shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The active electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is typically formed from tantalum. Typically, the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed out of single piece of metal that is molded into shape by a progressive die-stamping process. In some preferred versions of the invention, the active electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed from a sheet of metal having a thickness between 10 and 30 mils. In more preferred versions of the invention, the initial workpiece from which the electrode is formed has a thickness of between 15 and 25 mils. In the progressive die-stamping process, the metal workpiece from which the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed is sequentially shaped in a set of dies until the electrode has the desired final end shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The material from which the preferred active electrode is formed, tantalum, is economically obtainable in sheet metal form and the metal itself can readily be stamped or molded into shape. Thus, by forming the electrode from tantalum, it is possible to provide electrodes having numerous different geometric shapes, some of which are disclosed below. Also, given ease with which it can be stamped or molded into shape, it is relatively economical to provide a specifically-shaped active electrode using the preferred material of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shaped to have an elongated stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> extends rearwardly through a longitudinally oriented bore <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> formed in the sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The electrode stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> actually extends a short distance beyond the rear end of sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A crush tube <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> mechanically connects the exposed proximal end of electrode stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to an exposed end <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> of wire <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The crush tube <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is formed from a malleable conductive metal such as stainless steel. During the manufacture of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the electrode stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is covered with an adhesive <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and fitted in sleeve bore <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Crush tube <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is placed over the exposed end of the electrode stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the exposed end <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> of wire <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is fitted in the distal open end of the crush tube. The crush tube <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is then crimped down over the electrode stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and wire end <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. In this last step, the exposed head end of the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be pushed rearward. Thus, the crush tube <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> serves multiple functions. While the adhesive <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> that holds the electrode stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in sleeve bore <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> cures, the crush tube <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> serves as anchor to hold the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in place. Even after the adhesive cures, the crush tube <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> holds the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Further, the crush tube <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> secures the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the wire <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> over which the energization current is supplied to the electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The detailed structure of one particular tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that can be used with the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention is now described by reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes an electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>seated in a complementary insulating sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> that extends from the distal end of electrode stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is shaped so that head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> has the shape of a semi-spherical shell. Thus, the inner surface of the electrode is spaced away from the adjacent surface of the insulating sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>It will be noted that the distal end of the electrode stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, the portion connected to the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, is curved. More specifically, the distal end of the stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is shaped so that the rest of the stem projects rearwardly along an axis that intersects both the center outer surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and the center of the sphere inscribed by the head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is formed to have three through windows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Windows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> project upwardly from the outer perimeter of the head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and extend through the head. The windows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are spaced equangularly around the electrode head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>It will further be noted that electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed so that the windows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are defined by corners <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> that have a 90&deg; profile around the outer surface of the electrode. Windows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> subtend a significant amount of surface area on the outside of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. For example, if the outer surface of the electrode head subtends a radius of 67.5 mils, each window, which has a generally semicircular profile, subtends a radius of 20 mils. As a result of the formation of windows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> has three curved side walls <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The portions of the perimeter of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> between the windows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are referred to as the tines of the electrode head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed with an open ended head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shaped to receive the head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed to have a forward directed lip <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> that extends around the outer perimeter of the head. Lip <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> defines the space in the front end of the sleeve head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is seated. The lip <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is formed with three equangularly spaced apart notches <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. When the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is seated in sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the electrode windows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are in registration with the sleeve notches <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. Thus, the electrode windows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and sleeve notches <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> collectively form oval-shaped portals pathway that allow fluid to flow through the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> from one side of the head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to the other side. The purpose for allowing this fluid flow is discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of this invention is designed to foster the flow of bubbles away from the surgical site to which the assembly is applied. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference> depicts the flow of bubbles <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> that occurs when the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is initially applied to tissue <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> at a surgical site and the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operated in the cutting mode. At this point in the surgical procedure, the tissue <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> is not yet bent outwardly by the force of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. At this point in the process, the following activities occur that foster bubble flow away from the surgical site. First, as a result of the current flow through electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> begins to heat up. The thermal energy in the electrode head heats the surrounding solution. The heating of this solution causes its expansion so that it becomes more buoyant than the surrounding solution. This buoyant solution convects switch away from the surgical site. Consequently cooler, less buoyant solution flows toward the surgical site as represented by arrow <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the replacement solution flows towards the outer surface of the electrode head since this is where some of this thermal expansion of solution is occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> However, the outer surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is not the only location at which the heating causes the solution to convect away from tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The solution adjacent the inner surface of electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is also heated. This solution is similarly warmed to the point at which it likewise convects away from the from tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>More specifically, this solution convects away from the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> through the portals defined by electrode head windows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and sleeve notches <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. This convective flow is represented by arrow <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. This convective flow away tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>causes a portion of the replacement convective flow that is flowing towards the outer surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to flow through the portals as represented by arrow <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. This fraction of the replacement flow replaces the heated fluid that is convected away from the inner surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. Thus the replacement solution flows towards the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> along flow paths that run both parallel to the axis of the tool shaft and transverse to this axis. In other words, as a result of the heating of the solution adjacent the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, a convective fluid flow pattern develops around the surgical site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Eventually, sufficient thermal energy is supplied to the solution adjacent the surgical site that the solution vaporizes. This vaporization is the cause of the initial formation of bubbles at the surgical site. More particularly, this vaporization results in the rapid formation of bubbles <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> along both the inner and outer surfaces of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. These bubbles do not simply remain clustered around the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. Instead, the convective flow away from the portals in the tip assembly educts the bubbles <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> in a stream that is directed rearwardly away from the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The previously described convective flow of liquid towards the surgical site continues simultaneously with this bubble formation. The constant replenishment of this rewetting flow ensures that there is liquid-state fluid at the surgical site that is either thermally expanded, or being forced away from the site due to the rapid formation of bubbles. This liquid-state fluid flow further promotes the general migration of bubbles away from the surgical site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As the surgical procedure continues, tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>forces the adjacent tissue <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> to flex so as to develop the concave profile depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</cross-reference>. Eventually, bubbles <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> form adjacent the side walls <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. It is believed these bubbles <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> form as a result of the electrochemical reactions that take place due to the generation of relatively strong electromagnetic fields adjacent the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The concave bend of the adjacent tissue <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> directs the already existing convective fluid flow away from the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>rearwardly. Thus, these bubbles <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> tend to be caught up in this fluid flow and move rearwardly away from the surgical site. Moreover, it should be understood that bubbles <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> are able to move rearwardly because the portals through the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provide a flow path for the replacement liquid that is flowing towards the electrode head. As discussed above, and as represented by arrow <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, this fluid is diverted laterally into the portals where it serves as replacement fluid for the solution that has been convected away from the inner surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the bubbles <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> themselves serve to block the longitudinal flow of replacement fluid towards the outer surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. Since the portals provide a bleed flow path for this liquid-state fluid, this fluid does not function as a medium for transporting the bubbles forward towards the tissue <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> that defines the surgical site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as previously discussed, the flow through some of the portals is bidirectional. This convective flow contributes to the eduction of the bubbles <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> away from the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It will further be observed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</cross-reference> that vaporization induced bubbles <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> continue to be formed. These bubbles <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> become entrained in the flow of the bubbles produced adjacent the head side walls <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Thus, even when the tissue <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> against which the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of this invention folds around the tip assembly, the bubbles formed as a result of the activation of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> do not simply become trapped around the tip. Instead, the fluid flow portals allow flow pathways to form. The bubbles are educted away from electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> through these pathways. Since the bubbles are continually forced away from the electrode head, replacement solution is able to continually flow towards the head so that the head is continually kept in contact with the solution, &ldquo;rewetted.&rdquo; The constant rewetting of the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> facilitates a relatively constant current flow, stable arcing, between the active electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the convective fluid flow away from the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>around the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> prevents the bubbles that are formed adjacent the electrode head from becoming large in size. This is because, soon after a bubble is formed, it becomes trapped in the convective flow and is educted away from the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The constant eduction of newly formed bubbles away from the electrode head <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> prevents the bubbles that do form becoming large in size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A second tip assembly of this invention, tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, is now described by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 21</cross-reference>. Tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes an electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with a head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that is generally in the shape of a one-eighth section of the shell of a sphere. Thus, the inner surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is spaced away from the, adjacent surface of the insulator sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is further formed to have a small through portal <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. In some versions of the invention, head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> inscribes a section of a sphere that has a radius of 67.5 mils, portal <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> has a radius of 20 mils. The electrode head is further formed with corners <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> that both define portal <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and the side edges of the head. Corners <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> are defined by surfaces of the head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> that meet at 90&deg;. It will also be observed that electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> has side walls <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> that extend between the inner and outer surfaces of the electrode head. Two of the side walls <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> extend around the outer perimeter of the electrode head. A third side wall <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> defines portal <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is further formed so that a nose <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>, having a square cross section profile extends out from the distal tip of head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The purpose of nose <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> will be explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Insulating sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a head <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> with a generally cylindrically shaped profile. The distal end of head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is rounded. Head <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> is further formed to have a flow cavity <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> that extends into both the constant diameter main section and the distal end of the head. The sleeve head <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> is further formed to have a through bore <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> that extends laterally through the head from the outer surface of the head into the wall with in the head that defines the base of flow cavity <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. When tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is assembled, electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is seated in sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> so that the outer surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, in combination with the outer surface of the sleeve head <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> form the outer distal end of the tip assembly. When the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is so assembled, the portal <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> formed in the electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is in registration with the sleeve bore <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. Thus portal <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and sleeve bore <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> form a contiguous flow pathway through which there is fluid circulation across the inner and outer surfaces of the electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of this invention is used to contour or shape the tissue to which it is applied. When the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to which the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>attached is actuated, current flows between the electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the exposed end of the tool sleeve <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is pushed against the tissue to be ablated, nose <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> holds the side edges of the electrode head away from the adjacent surfaces of sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>As a result of the heating of the solution adjacent the inner and outer surfaces of the electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, initially a convective flow of replacement solution flows towards across the electrode head through the contiguous flow pathway defined by electrode portal <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and sleeve bore <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. As part of the convective flow pattern, the heated solution also flows out of the portal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Eventually, bubbles develop adjacent the side walls <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> of the electrode head. These bubbles do not simply remain trapped within the tip and surrounding tissue. Instead, these bubbles become entrained in the portion of the convective fluid flow that moves away from the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through the flow passageway. More particularly, it should be understood that since flow through the flow passageway is bidirectional along the length of the passageway, these bubbles will stream out of either the electrode head portal <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> or the sleeve bore <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The flow out of the flow passageway entrains bubbles that form around the outer side walls <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> of the electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to flow with it. Thus, the bubbles that form along the side of the electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are educted away from the head. This constant eduction of the bubbles serves to ensure that solution will continually flow towards the electrode head <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> so as to continually keep the head wetted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 through 25</cross-reference> illustrate a third tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>includes an electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>with three parallel, spaced apart tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> that are shaped to form loops. Electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is further formed to have small support bar <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> that extends perpendicularly across the ends of the tines that are spaced from stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Once the metal forming the third electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is stamped out of a flat sheet of material, the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and the support bar <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> are wrapped around an anvil so that the support bar abuts against the distal end of the electrode stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. This wrapping of the metal provides the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> with their loop shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is seated in the head end of a sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>The sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed with a head <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> that has an outer diameter equal to the outer diameter of the adjacent shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The head is shaped so as to define in the distal two-thirds of the head a socket space <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> for receiving the distal end of electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>including tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the head <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is provided with side walls <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> so that approximately 200&deg; of the outer circumference of each loop <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is exposed, that is, can be placed in contact with tissue. The open end of the sleeve head <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, in combination with the void space in center of the loops and the interstitial spaces between the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, serve as a portal and sub portals between the surfaces of tines and space outside the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The sleeve head <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is further shaped so as to project a small distance beyond the distal end of the most forward loop <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Sleeve head <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is further formed to have a post <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> that extends forward from the wall of the sleeve that defines the rear end of socket space <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>. When the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is seated in the socket space <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, post <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> extends through the loops. When the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> are pressed against the tissue, the post <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> provides mechanical support for the loops and prevents tissue from being caught in the tines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The third electrode assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is used to remove large masses of tissue in areas that extend perpendicular to tool shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is used by positioning the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>so that the exposed outer surfaces of the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> are pressed against the tissue to be removed. When the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to which tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is attached is actuated, the solution surrounding the electrode tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is heated. Cooler replacement solution flows towards the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> from the open distal end of the sleeve head <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. This fluid flows through the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and around the sleeve post <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>. The fluid then flows between the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> so as to replace the fluid the heated fluid that convectively moves away from the tines. More particularly, as represented by arrows <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the warmed fluid tends to flow away from the electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>along flow paths that parallel to the planes in which the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> are aligned. As represented by arrow <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight>, the replacement fluid flows towards the electrode along a flow path that is generally aligned with the center axis of the loops defined by the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Eventually, bubbles start to rapidly form adjacent the surfaces of the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. These bubbles become entrained in the convective fluid flow away from the tines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Thus, these bubbles do not simply become trapped between the tissue and the electrode where they can degrade the performance of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Instead, these bubbles, as part of the circulation flow away from the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>stream outwardly away from tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> A fourth tip assembly of this invention, tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>is now described by reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>includes an electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>with a stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shaped so that the distal end has a 90&deg; curve. A head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>The electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> has a circular cross sectional profile. The lateral profile of the head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is that of a flattened semi-circle. The inner surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is spaced away from the adjacent surface of the sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>against which the electrode head abuts. Four windows <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> are formed around the outer perimeter of head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Window <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> is formed by the void space from which the stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>extends. Windows <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> are located on either side of window <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> and are symmetric with respect to each other relative to that center axis through the head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Window <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is located forward of window <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>. Windows <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> is defined by straight edges. Windows <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> are defined by curved edges. The radius of curvature of the edges that define window <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> are greater than the radius of curvature of the edges that define windows <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight>. Electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, like the other electrode heads of this invention, is shaped so that the corners around the edges of the head and the windows <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> have 90&deg; profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> It will also be observed that electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> has side walls <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> that define the perimeters of windows <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. The side walls extend between the inner and outer surfaces of the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the fourth tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is shaped so as to have a head <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> with a curved profile. Thus, the head has a face <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> that lies in a plane that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with which tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is used. The head <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> is further shaped to have a notch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that extends rearward from the most distal end of the head. Notch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> thus provides a fluid communication path that extends from the front end of sleeve head <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> to face <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> When the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is seated in the sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>the distal end of the electrode stem <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>the curved portion, seats in the rear end of the space defined by notch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The base surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> seats against the sleeve face <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. The inner surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is spaced above the adjacent face <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>When the tip assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is so assembled, window <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> of the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is in registration over the end of the notch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that opens into face <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. Thus, window <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and notch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> collectively define a portal across the tip assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>It should also be recognized that since windows <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> are in fluid communication with window <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> along the underside of the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, windows <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> are likewise in fluid communication with notch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. These fluid communication paths form additional portals across the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The fourth tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>like the third tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>is used to remove tissue along radial lines that extend perpendicularly from the longitudinal axis of the complementary shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The fourth tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>however, in comparison to the third tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>removes only relatively small amounts of tissue at any given moment. This is because, owing to the presence of windows <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, the surface area of the head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> of the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is relatively small in size. Thus, the tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is used to precisely remove relatively small amounts of tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> When the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to which tip assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is actuated, the current flow heats the solution adjacent the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Consequently, convective, liquid-state fluid circulation occurs through the portals as a result of the movement of heated fluid away from electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the flow of cooler replacement fluid towards the electrode head. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> by arrow <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>some of the heated fluid tends to flow away from the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> through the top of the notch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As represented by arrow <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>another portion of the heated fluid tends to flow outwardly away from the outer surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Some replacement fluid flow, depicted by arrow <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>flows to the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> through the lower portion of the notch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the portion spaced from the electrode head. Still additional replacement fluid flow, represented by arrow <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>flows toward the outer surface of the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Eventually, due to the vaporization of the solution, bubbles form on the inner and outer surfaces of the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. These bubbles become entrained in the convective fluid flow away from the head through notch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Bubbles will also start to form adjacent the side walls <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> of the electrode head <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. These bubbles likewise become entrained in the convective fluid flow away from the tip assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>Thus, this embodiment of the tip assembly, like the other described embodiments, causes the bubbles to flow away from the surgical site so as to minimize the extent to which the bubbles interfere with the surgeon&apos;s view of the site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention is constructed so that the moving components of the switches <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that control the actuation of the tool are built into web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is constructed so that the act of mounting the web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> seals the border between the web and the nose cone. Thus, the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention has an on-handle mounted switch assembly for regulating the actuation of the tool that is both economical to install and that does not form paths through which fluid can leak into the handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention is also provided with an in-handle identification resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Depending on the voltage measured across this resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the complementary control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> configures itself to provide the appropriate powered signal to the tool. For example, when the identification resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> indicates that the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the resistor is installed is designed for ear, nose and throat surgery, the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will configure itself so as to only output a relatively small powered signal to the tool. In some versions of the invention, the maximum power of this low power cutting mode signal may be 50 Watts. If however, the identification resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> indicates that the tool is used for certain orthopedic applications, the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will configure itself to generate a relatively high powered signal. For example, in some versions of this invention the maximum power of this high power cutting mode signal may be 200 Watts. In still other versions of the invention, the tool emits short bursts of power. When the tool is operated in this mode, it may emit up to 250 Watts of power. As part of this self-configuration, the control console establishes the various power settings for the tool when it is to be operated at less than full power and also when it is to be operated in the coagulation mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the unlikely event there is a leak of fluid into the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the fluid will most likely flow across conductive trace <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and adjacent trace <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. As represented by a resistor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, this fluid effectively changes the resistance across resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> circuit on printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The voltage across resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is always being measured by the voltage measuring circuit <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> internal to the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, even when the tool is actuated. When, due to the insertion of resistor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in parallel across resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the resistance changes, the signal drops out of its normal range the control console circuit <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> recognizes this voltage drop as indication that there is malfunction in the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This circuit then inhibits the generation of coagulation or ablation causing current so as to prevent persons handling the tool from being shocked. This circuit will also actuate a warning light on the face of the control console (light not illustrated) to indicate that a fault condition has been detected. Also, while the conductive fluid of a leak may flow across one or both of the contact pads <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> so as to short switch <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> closed, this malfunction will not result in the tool being unintentionally actuated. Because, as described above, once the leak is detected, the control circuit <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> will have already blocked actuation of the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Still another feature of the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention is that the active electrode is formed out of tantalum. This metal is relatively easy to form into place so as to ensure that the electrode has a desired shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Also, the tip assemblies, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of this invention are designed so that when the tool is actuated in the cutting mode, the bubbles that are generated are relatively small and flow away from the surgical site. This regulation of bubble formation and flow serves to minimize the extent to which the bubbles both interfere with the surgeon&apos;s view of the surgical site and the extent to which they modulate and interrupt the current flow between the tool electrode and the associated shaft. Both these benefits allow the surgeon to focus his/her attentions on performing a procedure with the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as opposed to dealing with the undesirable consequences of the actuation of the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when an electrosurgical tool such as the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention is operated eschar, dead tissue, sometimes can accumulate on the electrode head. This material can degrade the performance of the tool. However, in the tip assemblies of this invention there is the above-discussed convective flow around the electrode head. This flow serves to remove, to clean, the tissue away from the electrode head so as reduce the effect this tissue has on the operation of the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> depicts the distal end of a shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of still another version of the electrosurgical tool of this invention.

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A lens <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is mounted in the distal end opening of sleeve bore <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. The lens <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is formed from material such as fused silica glass or other material that has a high degree optical transmisivity for infra-red light, light having a wavelength between 100 nm and 1 mm. A fiber optic cable <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is seated in bore <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> behind lens <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. Suitable cables that can be employed as fiber optical cable <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are fluoride or silver halide doped fused silica glass fiber optic cables available from Oxford Electronics of Oxford, England. In some versions of the invention, fiber optic cable has an outer diameter of between 0.1 and 1 mm. Lens <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is positioned and shaped so as to focus infra-red light waves generated at the surgical site on the distal end, the head end, of the cable <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> illustrates how the proximal end of fiber optic cable <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> extends to the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>More specifically, internal to the control console is an infra-red sensitive, photovoltaic transducer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> to which the light transmitted over fiber optic cable <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is applied. The signal produced by transducer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is applied to tool control circuit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> as an indication of the temperature of the tissue at the surgical site. In some versions of the invention, a second lens, not illustrated, may be positioned between the proximal end of the fiber optic cable <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and the transducer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. This lens is used to either focus or diverge the infra-red light emitted from the proximal end of the cable <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> over the infra-red sensitive surface of the transducer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In the version of the control unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33 a</cross-reference> manually-set wiper <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> connected to tool control circuit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> adjustably applies a fraction of the voltage present across a resistor <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to the tool controller. This voltage is representative of the temperature desired by the surgeon performing the procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, one or both of the buttons <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> mounted to the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be used to set the desired temperature. In these versions of the invention, a pulse counter and/or timer circuit is employed to convert the signals generated by the actuation of the button <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into a command signal indicating the desired temperature setting is to be raised or lowered. For example, in some embodiments of this version of the invention, the surgeon may depress button <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to indicate that the temperature at the surgical site should be increased. Button <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is selectively depressed to indicate that the temperature at the surgical site should be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> When the electrosurgical tool of this invention is used to perform a capsulary shrinkage procedure, the appropriate controls are actuated on the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Tool control circuit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, in turn, regulates the energization signal produced by a power supply <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> to cause an appropriate voltage to be applied to the active electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The active electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>now in a state in which it generates thermal energy, is applied to the tissue <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> in order to perform the capsulary shrinkage procedure. The heating of the tissue causes the quantity of infra-red energy emitted by the tissue to increase. A portion of this energy is transmitted to lens <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. The infra-red light waves received by lens <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> are focused by the lens are applied to the head end, the distal end of fiber optic cable <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. These light waves are, in turn, forwarded to transducer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. Transducer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> thus generates an output signal that varies as a function of the temperature of the tissue <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> forming the surgical site to which the tool is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The output signal produced by transducer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is applied to the tool control circuit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The tool control circuit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, based on level of the transducer signal, performs a real time regulation of the power supply <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> to ensure that tool continually heats the tissue to the desired temperature. If the infra-red light detected by transducer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> rises to a level indicative of a dangerous rise in tissue temperature, tool controller <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> forces the attenuation of the energization signal produced by power supply <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. Thus, the system of this invention regulates the heating of the surgical site <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to prevent thermally-induced damage of the tissue forming the site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The electrosurgical tool of this invention monitors the infra-red light generated by the tissue <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> forming the surgical site. The quantity of this light is directly proportional to the temperature of the site. Thus, by monitoring this light, the tool directly monitors the temperature at the surgical site. Moreover, still another feature of the tool of this invention is that the generation of this infra-red light, its collection by the lens <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and its transmission through fiber optic cable <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are not affected by the presence of stray electromagnetic waves that may be present due to the actuation of the tool. Thus, the electrosurgical tool of this invention is designed so that, while the active electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is energized in order to heat the site <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the temperature of the tissue is simultaneously monitored. This is true for versions of the invention in which an AC energization signal is applied to the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>One does not have to apply an energization signal in a pulsed pattern to the active electrode in order monitor site temperature. The tool can thus be energized continually in order to heat large amounts of tissue in a short amount of time so as to cause its capsullary shrinkage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Collectively, these features mean that the tool of this invention continually applies thermal energy to a surgical site to heat the site to a temperature at which capsulary shrinking occurs at an efficient rate and at which damage to the tissue is avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> It should be recognized that the foregoing description is only for the purposes of illustration. Other embodiments of the invention may have features different than what has been described. For example, not all versions of the invention may include the described on-handle switch assembly, the identification resistor, the leak detect traces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or one of the disclosed tip assemblies. Also, in alternative versions of the invention, the number of switches and the function of the switches integral with the switch assembly may vary. For example, in some versions of the invention it may be desirable to provide the switch assembly with switches that can be depressed to establish the power setting of the electrosurgical tool. These switches may be in addition to or in substitution of the switches that regulate the on/off operation of the tool and whether or not the tool is operating in the coagulation mode or the cutting mode. It may also be desirable for some applications to mount a single switch to the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in other versions of the invention, multiple identification resistors may be mounted to the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, the control circuit internal to the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, would measure the voltages across these individual resistors. Based on these voltages, different settings for the tool can be established. For example, it may be possible to set the control console for one from a first set of maximum power settings when the tool is operated in the coagulation mode and one from a second set of maximum power settings when the tool is operated in the cutting mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, instead of providing an identification resistor, a digital memory chip may be provided internal to the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This chip would store data that can be used to establish the various power settings of the signals that are applied to the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These versions of the invention may still contain a resistor. The resistor would serve the leak detect function which resistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> performs. Alternatively, the traces on the printed wiring board can be constructed so that if fluid enters the printed wiring board, it establishes a short circuit across the memory chip. In these versions of the invention, the complementary control console is configured to periodically read data from this chip. If, due to the presence of the short circuit, the control console is unable to read this data, a processor internal to the control console interprets this condition as indicating that there is a leak into the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The control console processor, in turn, takes appropriate action to either inhibit the generation of energization signals to the tool and/or actuate the appropriate indicator to inform the surgeon of this fault state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the tip assemblies of this invention may have structures different from what has been described. Other tip assemblies, with through holes in the electrodes and complementary through bores in the insulating sleeves that collectively form contiguous flow pathways may be provided to facilitate to tissue removal in patterns not disclosed. Also, while in the disclosed version of the invention, the corners around the edges of the electrodes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed at 90&deg;, that may not always be the case. The corners between the surfaces of the electrodes may meet at angles greater or less than 90&deg;. The primary goal in the forming of an electrode is that shaping of its tines so that there will be conductive fluid flow around and/or through the electrode. However, it has been observed that there are current densities that are higher around the sharp corners of the electrodes. These higher current densities result in better ablation of tissue. Accordingly, it is anticipated that other preferred electrodes of this invention will be formed with heads that have sharp corners. Moreover, while in the disclosed version of the invention the portals are oval shaped, circular or rectangular, it should be recognized that this need not always be the case. In other versions of the invention the portals defined by the electrode head and/or insulator sleeve may have different shapes. For example they may even be L-shaped or X-shaped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Also, the dimensions of the electrodes should be understood to be exemplary and not limiting. Clearly, the windows and portals may be larger or smaller depending on the type of cutting the electrode is designed to perform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Also, while in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the two traces <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that form part of the leak detect circuit are shown as running parallel to each other for a length equal to 72% of the overall length of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, that need not always be in the same in each version of this invention. In other versions of the invention, the traces forming the leak detect circuit may run parallel to each other for shorter or longer distances. For example, the traces may run together for a distance only. In still other versions of the invention, the leak detect traces may run together for a length equal to that of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> or may even surround the complete perimeter of the printed circuit board. In these latter versions of the invention, the traces would run together for a distance greater than twice the distance around the printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> It should similarly be recognized that the self-sealing web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be installed in handpieces integral with surgical tools other than surgical tools. For example, web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, may be installed in a handpiece that is part of a handpiece with a motor employed to actuate a cutting accessory. Alternatively, the web <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be installed in handpiece that is part of surgical laser or surgical ultrasonic tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Moreover, while the described version of the electrosurgical tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention is a bipolar tool, alternative monopolar versions of this tool can be provided. A monopolar electrosurgical tool has a single electrode. When electrosurgery with this type of tool is performed, the patient is externally grounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it may not be necessary to extend the fiber optic cable <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> of this invention to the complementary control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to which the eleoctrosurgical tool is connected. In some versions of this invention, an infra-red transducer identical or similar to transducer <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> may be mounted in the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the electrosurgical tool. In these versions of the invention, the output signal produced by the transducer is transmitted to the tool controller <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in the control console <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> over electrical conductors in the cable <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. An advantage of this version of the invention is that the need to extend the fiber optic cable to the control console is eliminated. In these versions of the invention it should be realized that the transducer may be mounted to a circuit board internal to the nose cone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is separate and sealed from the circuit board <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> forming the switch assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is the object of the appended claims to cover all such variations and modifications that come within the spirit and scope of this invention. </paragraph>
