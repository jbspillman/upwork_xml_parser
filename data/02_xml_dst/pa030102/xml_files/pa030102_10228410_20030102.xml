<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a yarn feed mechanism for a tufting machine and more particularly to a scroll-type pattern controlled yarn feed wherein each yarn may be wound on a separate yarn feed roll, and each yarn feed roll is driven by an independently controlled servo motor. A computerized design system is also provided because of the complexities of working with the large numbers of individually controllable design parameters available to the new yarn feed mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Pattern control yarn feed mechanisms for multiple needle tufting machines are well known in the art and may be generally characterized as either roll-type or scroll-type pattern attachments. Roll type attachments are typified by J. L. Card, U.S. Pat. No. 2,966,866 which disclosed a bank of four pairs of yarn feed rolls, each of which is selectively driven at a high speed or a low speed by the pattern control mechanism. All of the yarn feed rolls extend transversely the entire width of the tufting machine and are journaled at both ends. There are many limitations on roll-type pattern devices. Perhaps the most significant limitations are: (1) as a practical matter, there is not room on a tufting machine for more than about eight pairs of yarn feed rolls; (2) the yarn feed rolls can be driven at only one of two, or possibly three speeds, when the usual construction utilizing clutches is used&mdash;a wider selection of speeds is possible when using direct servo motor control, but powerful motors and high gear ratios are required and the shear mass involved makes quick stitch by stitch adjustments difficult; and (3) the threading and unthreading of the respective yarn feed rolls is very time consuming as yarns must be fed between the yarn feed rolls and cannot simply be slipped over the end of the rolls, although the split roll configuration of Watkins, U.S. Pat. No. 4,864,946 addresses this last problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The pattern control yarn feed rolls referred to as scroll-type pattern attachments are disclosed in J. L. Card, U.S. Pat. No. 2,862,465, are shown projecting transversely to the row of needles, although subsequent designs have been developed with the yarn feed rolls parallel to the row of needles as in Hammel, U.S. Pat. No. 3,847,098. Typical of scroll type attachments is the use of a tube bank to guide yarns from the yarn feed rolls on which they are threaded to the appropriate needle. In this fashion yarn feed rolls need not extend transversely across the entire width of the tufting machine and it is physically possible to mount many more yarn feed rolls across the machine. Typically, scroll pattern attachments have between 36 and 120 sets of rolls, and by use of electrically operated clutches each set of rolls can select from two, or possibly three, different speeds for each stitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The use of yarn feed tubes introduces additional complexity and expense in the manufacture of the tufting machine; however, the greater problem is posed by the differing distances that yarns must travel through yarn feed tubes to their respective needles. Yarns passing through relatively longer tubes to relatively more distant needles suffer increased drag resistance and are not as responsive to changes in the yarn feed rates as yarns passing through relatively shorter tubes. Accordingly, in manufacturing tube banks, compromises have to be made between minimizing overall yarn drag by using the shortest tubes possible, and minimizing yarn feed differentials by utilizing the longest tube required for any single yarn for every yarn. Tube banks, however well designed, introduce significant additional cost in the manufacture of scroll-type pattern attachments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One solution to the tube bank problems, which also provides the ability to tuft full width patterns is the full repeat scroll invention of Bradsley, U.S. Pat. No. 5,182,997, which utilizes rocker bars to press yarns against or remove yarns from contact with yarn feed rolls that are moving at predetermined speeds. Yarns can be engaged with feed rolls moving at one of two preselected speeds, and while transitioning between rolls, yarns are briefly left disengaged, causing those yarns to be slightly underfed for the next stitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another significant limitation of scroll-type pattern attachments is that each pair of yarn feed rolls is mounted on the same set of drive shafts so that for each stitch, yarns can only be driven at a speed corresponding to one of those shafts depending upon which electromagnetic clutch is activated. Accordingly, it has not proven possible to provide more than two, or possibly three, stitch heights for any given stitch of a needle bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As the use of servo motors to power yarn feed pattern devices has evolved, it has become well known that it is desirable to use many different stitch lengths in a single pattern. Prior to the use of servo motors, yarn feed pattern devices were powered by chains or other mechanical linkage with the main drive shaft and only two or three stitch heights, in predetermined ratios to the revolutions of the main drive shaft, could be utilized in an entire pattern. With the advent of servo motors, the drive shafts of yarn feed pattern devices may be driven at almost any selected speed for a particular stitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus a servo motor driven pattern device might run a high speed drive shaft to feed yarn at 0.9 inches per stitch if the needle bar does not shift, 1.0 inches if the needle bar shifts one gauge unit, and 1.1 inches if the needle bar shifts two gauge units. Other slight variations in yarn feed amounts are also desirable, for instance, when a yarn has been sewing low stitches and it is next to sew a high stitch, the yarn needs to be slightly overfed so that the high stitch will reach the full height of subsequent high stitches. Similarly, when a yarn has been sewing high stitches and it is next to sew a low stitch, the yarn needs to be slightly underfed so that the low stitch will be as low as the subsequent low stitches. Therefore, there is a need to provide a pattern control yarn feed device capable of producing scroll-type patterns and of feeding the yarns from each yarn feed roll at an individualized rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Commonly assigned copending application Ser. No. 08/980,045 addressed many of these concerns; however, even that servo scroll pattern attachment did not allow each end of yarn across the entire width of a full size tufting machine to be independently controlled. By providing each end of yarn with an independently driven yarn feed roll, the use of the tube bank can be eliminated, and patterns can be created that do not repeat across the entire width of a broadloom tufting machine. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of this invention to provide in a multiple needle tufting machine a pattern controlled yarn feed mechanism incorporating a plurality of individually driven yarn feed rolls across the tufting machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The yarn feed mechanism made in accordance with this invention includes a plurality of yarn feed rolls, each being directly driven by a servo motor. About twenty yarn feed rolls with attached servo motors, are mounted upon a plurality of arched mounting arms which are attached to the tufting machine. Each yarn feed roll is driven at the speed dictated by its corresponding servo motor and each servo motor can be individually controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of this invention to provide a pattern controlled yarn feed mechanism which does not rely upon electromagnetic clutches, but instead uses only servo motors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to eliminate the need for a tube bank in a scroll type pattern attachment, which further minimizes the differences in yarn feed rates to individual needles. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings in more detail, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> discloses a multiple needle tufting machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> upon the front of which is mounted a pattern control yarn feed attachment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in accordance with this invention. It will be understood that it is possible to mount pattern control yarn feed attachments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on both sides of a tufting machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when desired. The machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a bed frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> upon which is mounted a needle plate, not shown, for supporting a base fabric adapted to be moved through the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from front to rear in the direction of the arrow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by front and rear fabric rollers. The bed frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is in turn mounted on the base <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the tufting machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A main drive motor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, drives a rotary main drive shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> mounted in the head <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the tufting machine. Drive shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in turn causes push rods <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to move reciprocally toward and away from the base fabric. This causes needle bar <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to move in a similar fashion. Needle bar <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> supports a plurality of preferably uniformly spaced needles <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> aligned transversely to the fabric feed direction <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The needle bar <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be shiftable by means of well known pattern control mechanisms, not shown, such as Morgante, U.S. Pat. No. 4,829,917, or R. T. Card, U.S. Pat. No. 4,366,761. It is also possible to utilize two needle bars in the tufting machine, or to utilize a single needle bar with two, preferably staggered, rows of needles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In operation, yarns <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are fed through tension bars <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, into the pattern control yarn feed device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then yarns <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are guided in a conventional manner through yarn puller rollers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and yarn guides <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to needles <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A looper mechanism, not shown, in the base <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> acts in synchronized cooperation with the needles <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to seize loops of yarn <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and form cut or loop pile tufts, or both, on the bottom surface of the base fabric in well known fashions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In order to form a variety of yarn pile heights, a pattern controlled yarn feed mechanism <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> incorporating a plurality of yarn feed rolls adapted to be independently driven at different speeds has been designed for attachment between the tensioning bars <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the yarn puller rollers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As best disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, a yarn drive array is assembled on an arching support bar <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extending across the front of the tufting machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and providing opposing vertical mounting surfaces <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> on each of its sides and an upward facing top surface <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). On the opposing side-facing surfaces <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are mounted a total of 20 single end servo driven yarn feed rolls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, ten on each side, shown in isolation in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that the number of rolls on each support bar <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be varied for many reasons, especially in proportion to the gauge of the needles <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the needle bar <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For instance, in the case of &frac18; gauge needle spacing (8 needles per inch) and support bars spaced every three inches, it would be desirable to carry 24 independently driven yarn feed rolls on each support bar <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In practice, the support bars <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> should carry at least about 6, and preferably at least about 12, single end servo driven yarn feed rolls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A and in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the arching support bar <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> accommodates the wiring bundle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> from the motors via the wiring path <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, built into the arching support bar <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which facilitates the wiring of the motors. Wiring plugs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>join the wiring bundle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to leads connected to the motors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and allow for easy servicing. Wiring bundle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is in turn connected to servo motor controller board <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> which may be in a central cabinet or installed on an arching support <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. This latter wiring configuration minimizes the wire length from the controller board <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> to the motor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, thereby reducing tangling, wire damage due to excessive length, and electrical shorting. Troubleshooting electrical problems is also improved by this wiring configuration and shorter overall wire length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Each single end yarn drive <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> consists of a yarn feed roll <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a servo motor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, shown in isolation on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The servo motor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> directly drives the yarn feed roll <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which may be advantageously attached concentrically about the servo motor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. A tension roll <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, controls the feed and wrapping of the yarn onto the yarn feed roll <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to insure there is adequate traction of yarn <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with roll <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The yarn <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is guided onto the tension roll <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by the yarn guide plate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The position of the yarn guide plate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the tension roll <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is fixed with fastening screw <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Preferably a yarn <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is angled so that is wrapped around nearly 180&deg; of the circumference of the yarn feed roll <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and at least about 135&deg; of said circumference. Yarn guide posts <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> protrude from the rear of yarn guide plates <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and help ensure the proper placement of yarn <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on yarn feed rolls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It will also be noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 3A</cross-reference> that yarns from the yarn supply are fed through upper <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and lower <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>apertures on the support yarn guides <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Specifically, a yarn <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for a yarn feed drive <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> on the support distal from the tufting machine is fed through upper apertures <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>until it reaches its associated yarn drive, is fed around approximately 180&deg; of the yarn feed roll <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on its associated yarn drive <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and continues through upper apertures <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the support yarn guides <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> until the midpoint of the support <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is reached. At this point, the yarns <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for the distal yarn feed drives <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are threaded through lower apertures <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the remaining proximal yarn guides <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Conversely, yarns for proximal yarn drives come from the yarn supply through lower apertures <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the distal yarn guides <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> until about the middle of the yarn drives and the support <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> when those yarns <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are directed to the upper apertures <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the proximal yarn guides and cross the yarns from the distal yarn drives. In this fashion, the crossing of yarns occurs substantially at one point <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, opportunities for yarn friction and breakage minimized, and yarn threading simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 3B</cross-reference>, it is not necessary to cross the yarns, the offset position upper apertures <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from lower apertures <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the yarn guide plate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> begin sufficient to permit yarns to continue through the same aperture position and around their designated yarn feed rolls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> without significant friction between yarns <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 1D</cross-reference> feature the preferred wiring of arched supports <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> showing motors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or yarn feed drives <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> only on one vertical side <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the support <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The electrical connections <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from motors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> end in plugs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which mate with plugs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>set in cover plates <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Cover plates <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are removably secured to arched support <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and conceal individual servo motor controllers <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the invention is currently wired with four individual servo motor controllers <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, each controlling five motors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Collectively the four individual servo motor controllers comprise the servo motor controller board <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the controllers <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> may be dispersed under separate cover plates <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or collectively mounted on a single board <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> under a single cover plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, or even placed in a central controller cabinet depending upon wiring considerations. The wiring of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C and 8</cross-reference> is presently preferred. It will also be understood that more powerful controllers <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> might operate more than five motors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or in some instances fewer or even a single motor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> might be operated by a controller <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. The most desirable wiring for a given application will depend upon the speed and price of available controllers as well as the speed at which the yarn feed attachment is intended to operate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It will also be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> that the servo motors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are set on base plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of greater diameter than the yarn feed rolls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and are mounted onto the arching support bar <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> using four motor mount bolts <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> through mounting holes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the base plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Each feed roll <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a yarn feeding surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> formed of a sand-paper like or other high friction material upon which the yarns are fed. Each of these yarn feed rolls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be loaded with one yarn, which is a light load providing little resistance compared to the hundred or more yarns that might be carried on a roll-type yarn feed attachment, the hundreds of individual yarns typically driven by a single scroll drive shaft, or even the dozen yarns typically driven in co-pending Ser. No. 08/980,045. Because of the lighter loads used, this design permits the use of small servo motors that can mount inside or outside of the yarn feed rolls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. For instance, a typical motor for driving a single end of yarn would be a 24-28 volt motor using 3 amps of power. This motor would be able to generate 5 lb-in of torque at 3 amps, having a maximum no load speed of 650 RPM. A representative motor of this type is the Full Repeat Scroll Motor by Moog, Inc. (C22944), which meets these general specifications. A motor of this type is sufficiently powerful to turn the associated yarn feed roll without the need for any gearing advantage. Thus the preferred ratio of servo motor revolutions to yarn feed roll revolutions is 1:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> general electrical diagram of the invention is shown in the context of a computerized tufting machine. A personal computer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided as a user interface, and this computer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may also be used to create, modify, display and install patterns in the tufting machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by communication with the tufting machine master controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Due to the very complex patterns that can be tufted when individually controlling each end of yarn, many patterns will comprise large data files that are advantageously loaded to the master controller by a network connection <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>; and preferably a high bandwidth network connection. For instance, digital representations of complex scroll patterns for traditional scroll pattern attachments might be stored in about 2 Kb of digital memory. A digital representation of a pattern for the single end servo driver scroll of the present invention might not repeat for 10,000 stitches and could require 20 Gb of disk space before data compression and about 20 Mb even after compression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Master controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in turn preferably interfaces with machine logic <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, so that various operational interlocks will be activated if, for instance, the controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is signaled that the tufting machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is turned off, or if the &ldquo;jog&rdquo; button is depressed to incrementally move the needle bar, or a housing panel is open, or the like. Master controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may also interface with a bed height controller <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the tufting machine to automatically effect changes in the bed height when patterns are changed. Master controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also receives information from encoder <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> relative to the position of the main drive shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and preferably sends pattern commands to and receives status information from controllers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> for backing tension motor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and backing feed motor <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> respectively. Said motors <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are powered by power supply <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Finally, master controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, for the purposes of the present invention, sends ratiometric pattern information to the servo motor controller boards <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The master controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> will signal a particular servo motor controller board <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> that it needs to spin its particular servo motors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at given revolutions for the next revolution of the main drive shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in order to control the pattern design. The servo motors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in turn provide positional control information to their servo motor controller board <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> thus allowing two-way processing of positional information. Power supplies <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are associated with each servo motor controller board <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and motor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Master controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also receives information relative to the position of the main drive shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Servo motor controller boards <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> process the ratiometric information and main drive shaft positional information from master controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to direct servo motors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to rotate yarn feed rolls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> the distance required to feed the appropriate yarn amount for each stitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In commercial operation, it is anticipated that a typical broadloom tufting machine will utilize pattern controlled yarn feed devices <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the present invention with 53 support bars <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, each bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> yarn feed drives <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> thereby providing 1060 independently controlled yarn feed rolls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. If any yarn feed roll <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> or associated servo motor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> should become damaged or malfunction, the arched support bar <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be pivoted downward for ease of access. A replacement single end yarn drive <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> already fitted with a yarn feed roll <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a servo motor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be quickly installed. This allows the tufting machine to resume operation while repairs to the damaged or malfunctioning yarn feed rolls and motor are completed, thereby minimizing machine down time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The present feed attachment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provides substantially improved results by providing scroll type yarn control while eliminating the need for a tube bank. Historically, tube banks have been designed in three ways: to minimize tube length, to minimize differences in yarn drag through the tubes, and to compromise between these two alternatives. All tube bank designs entail significant expense and introduce undesirable yarn drag into tufting operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The present design, unlike the previous art, does not use tube banks to distribute the yarns <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the needle bar <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Instead the yarns <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are directly routed to the needle bars <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the yarn guides <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. This is possible because yarns can be individually driven by feed rolls in directional alignment with the respective needles. By eliminating the tube banks, the source of friction variations is removed, eliminating the need for control schemes to correct for this problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Another significant advance permitted by the present pattern control attachment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to permit the exact lengths of selected yarns to be fed to the needles. Unlike the previous art, each yarn may be controlled individually to produce the smoothest possible finish. For instance, in a given stitch in a high/low pattern on a tufting machine that is not shifting its needle bar the following situations may exist: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> 1. Previous stitch was a low stitch, next stitch is a low stitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> 2. Previous stitch was a low stitch, next stitch is a high stitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> 3. Previous stitch was a high stitch, next stitch is a high stitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> 4. Previous stitch was a high stitch, next stitch is a low stitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Obviously, with needle bar shifting which requires extra yarn depending upon the length of the shift, or with more than two heights of stitches, many more possibilities may exist. In this limited example, it is preferable to feed the standard low stitch length in the first situation, to slightly overfeed for a high stitch in the second situation, to feed the standard high stitch length in the third situation, and to slightly underfeed the low stitch length in the fourth case. On a traditional scroll type attachment, the electromagnetic clutches can engage either a high speed shaft for a high stitch or a low speed shaft for a low stitch. Accordingly, the traditional scroll type attachment cannot optimally feed yarn amounts for complex patterns which results in a less even finish to the resulting carpet. The independence obtained by the single end servo scroll would allow for these minor changes on a per yarn basis, enabling pattern capabilities that were not possible before. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In a typical configuration, the single end yarn drives would be spaced at about four to seven inch intervals along the support bar. This spacing is necessary to ensure proper yarn travel and minimal yarn resistance and stretching while still allowing for enough space between the yarn feed rolls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to allow minor adjustments. The distance between support brackets is typically 3 &frac14; inches but may vary in either direction. This variability is necessary because of variations in the needle gauge that may be used. For instance, a larger needle gauge will require the needles be spread at further intervals allowing more space between the support arms. However, for the smaller needle gauge, the support arms will need to be closer together due to the increased proximity of the needles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> There are several advantages to having independently controlled single end yarn drives, particularly with regards to the patterns that can be created. By having each end of yarn independently controlled by its own dedicated yarn drive, this pattern device can produce designs that are not possible using previous broad loom tufting machines. For instance, a non-continuous repeating pattern may be made across the width of the tufting machine, utilizing three or more yarn heights for each yarn. This pattern could consist of any design such as a word message or non-repeating geometric design across the entire carpet in various colors. Another design type that this type of pattern device may create is a rug with central design surrounded by a border. For example, a rug with a word phrase surrounded in the center by one color, then surrounded by a border of another color could easily be produced with this device without special consideration. A rug <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with a series of centric borders, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> may also be tufted. Each yarn in rug <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is tufted through a backing fabric so that a series of back stitches are on the bottom of finished rug while the tufted bights form cut or loop pile stitches on the top or face of the finished rug. The yarns in each border may be tufted at three or more lengths to precisely control the yarns for color transitions or sculptured effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Although the illustrated borders are shown in two colors, the border patterns could also be created in a high/low textured or sculpted manner from a single color of yarn. Typically the borders, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, will surround a central area <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The central area <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may or may not be textured or contain a design <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A second type of design possible with this pattern attachment is one that involves the creation of color picture designs that are facimiles of digital images. By loading a front pattern device with A and B yarns fed to a front needle bar and loading a rear pattern device with C and D yarns fed to a rear needle bar, full color pictures may be created from the yarns. Typically, the A, B, C, and D yarns will consist of shades of red, yellow, and green or red, yellow, and blue, combined with another color for aid in light and dark shading. Many other combinations of colored yarns may be used to achieve varied results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, a color image is digitally input into a computer using a scanner, as typified by Hewlett Packard ScanJet 5100c or other digital device. The digital image is processed by the computer, which calculates the correct yarn color mixes and corresponding yarn heights to produce the desired spectral effect. The yarn height information is translated into rotational instructions for each yarn drive. Using this information, an approximation of the digital image can be recreated within the yarns of a carpet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The prior art for the creation of carpet of individually tufted yarns is typified by U.S. Pat. No. 4,549,496 where a pneumatic system is used to direct each strand of yarn in the pattern control device. This process has significant limitations involving size of rugs it can produce and the production speed due to the complexity of directing the various colored yarns using pneumatic technology, and the limited number of needles sewing each stitch. With the single end servo scroll pattern attachment described, broad loom carpets with complex color pictures are created with greater efficiency and speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described above, it is to be understood that any and all equivalent realizations of the present invention are included within the scope and spirit thereof. Thus, the embodiments depicted are presented by way of example only and are not intended as limitations upon the present invention. While particular embodiments of the invention have been described and shown, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited thereto since many modifications can be made. Therefore, it is contemplated that any and all such embodiments are included in the present invention as may fall within the scope or equivalent scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
