<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of soft ice cream freezers, and frozen beverage dispensers, specifically to a small and portable, self-contained, self-cleaning domestic frozen food and beverage system having the capability of preparing and dispensing soft ice cream products, frozen yogurt products, milk shakes, slush drinks, and other smooth frozen foods and beverages automatically, in a short period of time, typically less than fifteen minutes. Preferably, transfer of unfrozen ingredients into the system, as well as dispensing of frozen product therefrom, would be performed in an efficient and spill-free manner. One preferred embodiment would allow a user to simply transfer ingredients for the desired product from a holding container with a specifically configured bottle cap into a paired receptacle communicating with the thermally conductive freezing chamber, the paired bottle cap and receptacle causing transfer of ingredients to be blocked until the bottle cap is securely seated within the receptacle. Ingredient flow is again blocked as soon as the bottle cap begins to be drawn away from the receptacle, thus avoiding the opportunity for any spills. In addition to being spill-free, ingredient transfer using such a bottle cap and paired receptacle into the freezing chamber would also be made hands-free. Once the correct amount of the desired ingredients has been transferred into the freezing chamber of the present invention, and since it is a fully integrated, automated, programmable machine, to begin the freezing process a user would simply select and depress the start button corresponding to the type of product desired. An inlet port or several inlet ports evenly disposed about the freezing chamber to introduce fluid flow under pressure around the outside of the freezing chamber for maintaining a substantially uniform temperature therein as well as an auger member disposed within the freezing chamber in a position to rotate about its longitudinal axis in a first direction while concurrently rotating about the longitudinal axis of the freezing chamber in a second direction that is substantially opposite to the first rotational direction, help the present invention to achieve a rapidly frozen product, typically within a time period of less than 15 minutes. Once operation begins, a microprocessor within the housing controls the temperature and speed of ingredient mixing until auger torque indicates that the product has reached the consistency desired, whereafter the system automatically shuts itself off after sending a signal to the user that the partially frozen product is ready for consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There have been many ice cream freezers designed for domestic use. Some prior art ice cream freezers contemplate a thermally conductive freezing chamber that is removably placed within an insulated outer housing filled with freezing agent during an initial cooling phase, during which the product within the freezing chamber is thoroughly mixed, with the freezing chamber being placed into the freezer portion of a refrigerator after the initial cooling phase for product storage until use. Others contemplate the use of a freezing agent being routed through coils placed in contact with the thermally conductive freezing chamber. Most can be messy to use, and/or awkward or cumbersome to clean after use. While in U.S. Pat. No. 5,845,512 and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,617,734 the inventor herein has been one of several co-inventors previously disclosing a freezing chamber having a plurality of inlet ports and the use of an auger member with concurrently opposing dual rotational means to produce a soft frozen food product, there is no prior art known that discloses a compact and easily portable, self-contained, self-cleaning, fully integrated, automated and programmable domestic frozen food and beverage system with all of the features and advantages of the present invention, including the capability of preparing and dispensing soft ice cream products, frozen yogurt products, milk shakes, slush drinks, and other types of frozen food and beverage products automatically, in a short period of time, and in a neat and efficient manner. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The primary object of this invention is to provide a compact, self-contained domestic freezing and dispensing system for countertop use that can chill foods and beverages to a desired temperature and consistency in a short period of time. A further object of this invention is to provide a freezing and dispensing system that is efficient and easy to use. It is also the object of this invention to provide a freezing and dispensing system that creates partially frozen food and beverage products automatically and without a mess. It is a further object of this invention to provide a freezing and dispensing system that is compact in configuration for countertop use, sufficiently lightweight so as to be easily portable, and aesthetically pleasing in design. It is also an object of this invention to provide a freezing and dispensing system that is self-cleaning after use. It is a further object of this invention to provide a freezing and dispensing system that allows for spill-free introduction of product ingredients into its freezing chamber. It is also an object of this invention to provide a freezing and dispensing system with which a user can produce a wide variety of partially frozen food and beverage products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As described herein, properly manufactured and used, the frozen food and beverage preparation and dispensing system of the present invention is a fully integrated, automated, and programmable machine that is small, compact, and easily portable, and allows domestic users to make smooth frozen foods and beverages rapidly and without a mess. In 15 minutes or less, while using the most preferred embodiment of the present invention system, a user could have soft ice cream, frozen yogurt, a milk shake, or a slush drink, simply by 1) adding a prepackaged mix into the system though a dispensing bottle cap and receptacle combination that prevents ingredient flow until the dispensing bottle cap is fully seated within the receptacle, 2) discarding the dispensing container in an appropriate waste receptacle, 3) selecting one of several touch keys or buttons that corresponds to the desired final consistency of the intended product, and when the system signals to a user that the product is finished 4) selecting the touch key or button that will cause the soft frozen product to be dispensed. When the &lsquo;Dispense&rsquo; mode is used, the auger operates at a higher speed to push frozen product, or cleaning solution, beyond the pattern cap attached to the dispensing head. Clean up after use is also automated, fast, and efficient. The user simple adds a cleaning solution, sanitizing solution, or water instead of food product ingredients, and then selects the touch key or button indicating a &lsquo;wash&rsquo; or &lsquo;cleaning cycle&rsquo;. The auger speed will increase beyond that routinely used to make a food or beverage product, and agitate the water or solutions within the inner tube of the freezing chamber to thoroughly and expeditiously clean the inside surfaces of the freezing chamber. Once the cleaning cycle is complete, audible and/or visual signals are produced to signal the user that the cleaning process is done, after which the user would need to select the &lsquo;Dispense&rsquo; touch key or button that will eject the cleaning solution from the system. The present invention is sufficiently compact in configuration and light in weight, so as to be easily moved from one place to another in a domestic kitchen or in a small eatery. It is self-contained, the user cannot check on the product part way though the freezing process except by disconnection of the system from its available power source, and the user is not required to separate components prior to cleaning it as the cleaning cycle is fully automatic. It is also versatile since it can produce a wide variety of food and beverage products, and since it can create consistent and desirable products in a short period of time and is so easy to use, a person preparing a meal could potentially prepare several frozen food products freshly made for guests in the no more time than it would take to prepare the main course. Since the present invention is fully automated and run by the touch of one button or key, it is simple enough for children to use, even younger children as long as adult supervision is nearby. It also uses a paired dispensing cap and receptacle that together prevent dispensing unless the dispensing cap is fully seated within the receptacle, preventing any mess. Even when one attempts to lift the dispensing cap from the receptacle after ingredient transfer into the receptacle, disconnection is spill-free as ingredient transfer is blocked again once the cap member begins to be lifted away from the receptacle. As an added convenience, when a bayonet turn is applied to the dispensing cap during the time it is seated within the receptacle, the cap member becomes locked within the receptacle and ingredient transfer can be hands-free. Also, the auger has a particular configuration and mixing action that is efficient in preparing a soft frozen product, and the freezing chamber has a configuration incorporating a thermally conductive inner tube and an non-conductive outer tube which together form a sealed chamber through which coolant can be dispersed evenly around the inner tube, allowing for rapid cooling of any food product being mixed within the inner tube. An inlet port, or several inlet ports evenly disposed about the freezing chamber, would introduce fluid flow under pressure around the outside of the freezing chamber for maintaining a substantially uniform temperature therein. Also, in addition to its other features, its compact self-contained design is attractive and allows for convenient dispensing of the product. No domestic ice creamer making or frozen beverage-dispensing device is known with all of the features and advantages of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The description herein provides preferred embodiments of the present invention but should not be construed as limiting the scope of the fully integrated, automated, programmable machine herein for preparing and dispensing smooth frozen foods and beverages. For example, variations in the number of inlet ports used in its freezing chamber; the positioning of components within the chassis; the type of materials used for the chassis, outer housing, front cover, and dispensing head assembly; the manner of spill-free ingredient introduction into the freezing chamber, and the size of the receptacle and paired bottle cap, when used; other than those shown and described herein may be incorporated into the present invention. Thus, the scope of the present invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than being limited to the examples given herein. </paragraph>

For spill-free operation, a receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> would communicate with the opening in housing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> leading to freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the system would include bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> configured for pairing with receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so that transfer of ingredients is blocked until bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is securely seated within receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Ingredient flow is again blocked as soon as bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> begins to be drawn away from receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, thus avoiding the opportunity for any spills. In addition to being spill-free, ingredient transfer into the freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the most preferred embodiment of the present invention can also be made hands-free once bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is securely seated and locked into receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. After the correct amount of the desired ingredients has been transferred into the freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the present invention, and since it is a fully integrated, automated, and programmable machine, to begin the freezing process a user would simply select and depress the one of the touch key controls <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> corresponding to the type of product desired. An inlet port or several inlet ports, such as supply fittings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, evenly disposed about the freezing chamber to introduce fluid flow under pressure around the outside of the freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for maintaining a substantially uniform temperature therein as well as an auger member, such as auger assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, disposed within the freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a position to rotate about its longitudinal axis in a first direction while concurrently rotating about the longitudinal axis of the freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a second direction that is substantially opposite to the first rotational direction, help the present invention to achieve a rapidly frozen product, typically within a time period of less than 15 minutes. Once operation begins, a microprocessor, such as printed circuit board <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, within housing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> controls the temperature and speed of ingredient mixing until auger torque indicates that the product has reached the consistency desired, whereafter the system automatically shuts itself off after sending a signal to the user that the partially frozen product is ready for consumption. </paragraph>

Spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> biases valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> into its closed position against the top surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, until bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is moved longitudinally into contact with receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> whereby the tapering upper surfaces <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, becomes partially inserted through the cutout pattern <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> in disk-like spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, and the top of spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is permitted by disk-like spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to push sufficiently against the tip of activation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to lift valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> a fractional distance away from the top surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The compressed energy in spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> then causes valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to return to its closed position against spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, as soon as dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is removed from receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The number of coils present in spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is not critical, nor is the thickness dimension of disk-like spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> as long as each can effectively perform the function for which it was designed. Also, the diameter of the material used for spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can vary in different applications. The diameter of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is also variable, but must be sufficiently large to allow ample clearance for movement of disk-like spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> within its hollow interior. The diameters of activation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the central opening <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in the upper surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can also vary in size, as long as the diameter of central opening <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> remains sufficiently large to allow easy movement of activation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> therethrough without undue friction and wear. The number, size, and configuration of spiral threads <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can also vary, as long as they provide complementary engagement with threads (not shown) on the outside neck surface of holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The thickness is valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is also not critical, as long as it has a minimum thickness dimension that allows it sufficient rigidity to permit material flow without the material of valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> buckling or folding under the weight of the dry or liquid substance stored in holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as it begins to flow. Further, the pattern in the ribbed outer surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is not critical, and needs only to provide an easily-gripped surface for the hand of the person attempting to connect it to holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The thickness dimension of the material used for bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> should provide for a sturdy construction of bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. However, for cost-effective manufacturing the thickness of bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> should not be increased above or below the levels at which an appropriate benefit is no longer derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Although material used for manufacture can vary, it is contemplated for bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in the most preferred embodiment of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be made from plastic materials and have a unitary molded construction. Valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the most preferred embodiment can be made from the same plastic material used for bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, or from a different material. For extended, trouble-free use, it is also contemplated for valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to have a unitary molded construction. It is further contemplated in the most preferred embodiment of present invention <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for coil spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to be made from non-corroding, non-toxic materials, such as stainless steel, and for disk-like spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to be made from either plastic or metal materials. Since it is intended for food or ingestible liquids to be transferred from holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> into receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, all materials anticipated to be in contact with product ingredients should be non-reactive and non-toxic. The size of holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> relative to dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is not critical, and does not have to be limited to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. However, when hands-free transfer of material from holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is desired once dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is locked in relation to receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the shape of any holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> connected to bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> must allow it to be inverted in a substantially symmetrical position over receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for proper balance. Since it is contemplated for use with edible products, dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> should be made from materials that are easily cleaned and sanitized, with recyclable materials being employed when their use is cost-effective. </paragraph>

Receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is secured within the upper surface of chassis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The size of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> relative to chassis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is not critical, and does not have to be limited to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In addition, connection of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to chassis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> should not be limited to the upper surface of chassis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, and can be connected to a side surface of chassis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, as long as discharge opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is placed in a superior position relative to field tube elbow <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that gravity-assisted flow can be used to introduce ingredients (not shown) into inner tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> prior to freezing. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> being substantially cylindrical, with an outwardly extending upper flange adjacent to its top open end and opposing attachment pins <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> downwardly depending from the lower surface of the upper flange. The radially extending flange of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provides a connection means for attachment of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to chassis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, as well as a connection means for hinged operation of a dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> over the top open end of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> between periods of ingredient transfer. It is not critical for attachment pins <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to be used for the connection of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to chassis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, and any secure means can be used that allows receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to remain stationary relative to chassis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> when a bayonet turn is applied to dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to lock it in place against the interior surface of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Also, when attachment pins <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are used, they are not limited in size, configuration, or number to the two opposing attachment pins <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In the most preferred embodiment of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> used in present invention <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it is contemplated for approximately six or seven attachment pins <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to be employed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> also shows receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having a top open end and a hollow interior with several stepped interior surfaces <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>decreasing in diameter toward its bottom end, with a substantially rectangular-shaped protrusion <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> inwardly depending from the inside wall surface of the receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> between the uppermost stepped interior surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the middle stepped interior surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Although the most preferred embodiment of the present invention bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> would have a single protrusion <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> within receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for more cost-effective manufacture, it is also considered to be within the scope of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to have more than one protrusion <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> further shows receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having a discharge opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> centrally within its bottom end and a spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> permanently mounted within discharge opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, with the middle and lower portions of spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> having several spaced-apart flukes <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> radially extending from its outside surface and each fluke <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> ending in an upwardly tapering surface <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The configuration of upwardly tapering surface <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> limits the type of dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that can be locked within receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and initiate material transfer through discharge opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, to a dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> containing a spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> with a cutout pattern <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> that complements upwardly tapering surface <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Should upwardly tapering surface <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> not be able to become partially inserted with cutout pattern <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> prior to a locking bayonet turn being applied to bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to lock it within receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as the bayonet turn is applied the spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> will not advance sufficiently forward within spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to contact the tip of actuation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and cause valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to be lifted away from the upper surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and ingredient flow into inner tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will not occur. Thus, bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, in addition to providing spill-free transfer, can also be used to limit the source of ingredients conveniently transferred into inner tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for freezing. The number of flukes <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> on spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is not critical, but should not be so numerous as to impede the flow of material through discharge opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In the most preferred embodiment of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> it is contemplated for four flukes <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> to be employed, with the upper tapering surface <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of each fluke <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> being aligned to engage a different one of the arm members in the X-shaped opening <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> of disk-like spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> would be permanently secured within the discharge opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the bottom of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, where flukes <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> would allow easy and unimpeded flow of ingredients through discharge opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. It is also contemplated that spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> would be manufactured from the same material used make receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and in the most preferred embodiment spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> would be made as a single unit through molded construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> further shows a dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> sealing the upper open end of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> between ingredient transfer uses. The main body of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is in a position raised above the upper flange of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, with its lower rim <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> extending downwardly a short distance within the top open end of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The hinged end of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, and in the most preferred embodiment of present invention bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> the hinged end of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> would comprise a single attachment post <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, a concave hinge member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, and a retaining ring <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> on attachment post <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> near to hinge member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. Attachment post <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> securely connects the rearward end of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> through an attachment hole in the upper flange of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which remains hidden from view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The diameter of such an attachment hole would correspond to the dimension required for insertion of attachment post <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to the depth needed for proper seating of lower rim <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> within the top open end of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Attachment post <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and concave hinge member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> allow the main body of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to be rotated upwardly away from receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> prior to and during ingredient transfer, and subsequently lowered for renewed engagement with the top open end of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> after ingredient transfer. A retaining ring <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> helps to prevent attachment post <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> from being inadvertently removed from the attachment hole in the upper flange of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> while the lower rim <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is being inserted into and removed from the top open end of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Concave hinge member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> allows the main body of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, raised portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and lower rim <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to be rotated as a unit upwardly away from the top open end of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so that holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> connected by threaded attachment to bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be placed into locking engagement with receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for ingredient transfer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows the end of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> remote from attachment post <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> having a front raised portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> that improves the grip of an operator&apos;s hand on dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> during removal of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> from the upper opening in receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The configuration of front raised portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be any shape that is aesthetically pleasing and easily manipulated by an operator&apos;s hand. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> also shows a plurality of raised circular protrusions <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> on the top surface of front raised portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Although raised circular protrusions <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are mainly decorative, they can also be configured to assist in an improved operator grip for easy lifting of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> away from receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or replacing dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> within the upper opening on receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> between ingredient transfer use. In the most preferred embodiment of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, it is not contemplated for raised portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to be separable from the remainder of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Although not limited thereto, in the most preferred embodiments of the present invention the entire dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, or at least the main body of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, raised portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and lower rim <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> would be made from a flexible material such as plastic or rubber. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows front raised portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> having a substantially circular configuration, it is considered to be within the scope of the present invention for any shape to be used that is aesthetically pleasing and easily manipulated by an operator&apos;s hand. Further, in contrast to the raised circular protrusions <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows the top surface of front raised portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> having no surface decoration. Thus, surface decoration on raised portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is considered to be merely a matter of design choice. Since chassis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> has a balanced and stable configuration, hands-free ingredient transfer into freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can occur after dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is locked into receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with a bayonet turn. </paragraph>

The configuration of ribbed outer surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is not critical, and not limited to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>. However, the configuration of ribbed outer surface <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> must be one that is easily gripped by an adult human hand for prompt attachment or removal of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Also, spiral threads <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can have any configuration that securely connects bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the neck of a targeted holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and provides a leak-proof connection therebetween. The notches <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> through outer bottom rim <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> must be dimensioned and configured for insertion of substantially rectangular protrusion <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> on the inside surface of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so that as bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is longitudinally moved into contact with receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and a bayonet turn is applied, side channel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> can be made to move around rectangular protrusion <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> until rectangular protrusion <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> makes contact with the stop <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> within side channel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, that is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> centrally positioned between opposing notches <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>.

However, cutout pattern <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> must complement the configuration of the upwardly tapering surfaces <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> so that as bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is moved longitudinally toward receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and comes very near to receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, upwardly tapering surfaces <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> become partially inserted within cutout pattern <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, and so that when bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is finally placed in full contact with receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the top of spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> will have made sufficient contact with the tip of activation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to fractionally raise it and thereby lift valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> a short distance away from the top outside surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to initiate material flow downwardly past the outer edge of valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> show the direction of material flow anticipated around the downwardly arcuate outer edge of valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the most preferred embodiment of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows the most preferred embodiment of the coil spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> used in the present invention bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, with spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> having a substantially uniform diameter dimension and uniformly spaced apart coils. During use of spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> within dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, activation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> centered within spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, with spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> extending between disk-like spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the circular ridge <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> on the top inside surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The number of coils present in spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and the material from which spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is made, are not critical as long as spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can properly bias valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> into its fully closed position against the top surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Although the diameter of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can vary, it must allow ample clearance for unrestricted movement of the spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> chosen for use within its hollow interior. Further, the diameter of spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can vary in different applications, as long as disk-like spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is also correspondingly sized to engage spring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, maintain it within spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and move spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> the correct longitudinal distance within spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> after bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is finally in full contact with receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so that the top of spring nut engagement member is <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> comes in contact with the tip of activation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> with sufficient force to compress spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and lift valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> the necessary distance above spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to initiate ingredient flow into receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. After the needed amount of ingredient transfer is complete, bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is separated from receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the upper surfaces <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are no longer in contact with the tip of activation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the stored compression energy in spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> causes valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to again be biased in a closed position against the outside surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In the most preferred embodiment of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, it is not contemplated for more than a fractional movement of valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to take place, for example but not limited to a distance of one-sixteenths of an inch, before it is sufficiently unseated from spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to initiate material flow around outer edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference> respectively show dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in partially assembled and fully assembled condition. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> partially inserted within receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> prior to full contact with the bottom inside surface of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, illustrated by the gap <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and small arrows between the central bottom surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the bottom inside surface of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> remains in a closed position against the top surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> so as to prevent ingredient flow into receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In contrast, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> fully inserted within receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, after the bayonet turn has been made that locks protrusion <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> within channel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to secure dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, with the central bottom surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> being in full contact with the bottom inside surface of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as illustrated by the gaps <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and small arrows between valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the top surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, as well as between the inside bottom surface of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the downwardly curving outer edge of the flange that is radially depending around the lower open end of valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In such a position, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in an open configuration that would allow ingredients (not shown) to flow from an inverted holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> attached to dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), all the way through receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and into the inner tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The amount of separation in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> between outer edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the inside bottom surface of bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is enlarged for illustrative purposes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> further shows dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in a partially opened position above the upper opening in receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, with double-headed arrows showing that dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be moved in both upward and downward directions relative to receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> when required. Dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is employed for sealing the upper opening in receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> between uses of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for ingredient transfer, with dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> being attached to the upper flange of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through use of an attachment post <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. A ring <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> would keep attachment post <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> from being inadvertently removed from the upper flange in receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> while in use. A concave hinge member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> allows the main body of dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, raised portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and lower rim <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to be rotated upwardly as a unit away from the top end opening in receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, so as not to adversely interfere with holding container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> while it is connected by threaded attachment to a bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in locked engagement with receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Manufacture of bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, disk-like spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, could each be accomplished through unitary construction from molded plastic. Spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is not limited to any one type of material, however, it should have sturdy and durable construction for trouble-free repeat use over an extended period of time. In the most preferred embodiment of present invention <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the spring nut engagement member <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> would be molded in a fixed position within discharge opening <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as part of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Dispensing bottle cap assembly <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> would be placed into its usable form by inserting valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> within bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> so that activation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> extends through central aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A coil spring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> would be placed within the hollow interior of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> either before or after activation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is inserted therethrough, and then prevented from being withdrawn from the open end of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> by disk-like spring nut <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. When valve closure member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is in its fully closed position against the top surface of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and preventing communication between the upper portion of bottle cap member and small holes <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> around the base of spring housing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, activation pin <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> would extend a small distance below the central bottom surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of bottle cap member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. No further assembly would be required to place receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> into its usable condition, except that a dust cap <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> made from a unitary molded construction and flexible material can be placed within the upper opening of receptacle to keep unwanted objects from becoming deposited on the interior walls of receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so that it does not require cleaning between uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Although not limited there to, most of the objects mounted within chassis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are done so with various types of screws (not shown), or bolts, nuts, and washers. Further, although not critical in the preferred embodiment, it is contemplated for tubing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the most preferred embodiment of the present invention, connected between receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to be flexible tygon tubing. For most efficient mixing of food product ingredients (not shown) within inner tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, it preferred that the inside surface of inner tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> be substantially smooth. One suggested material for inner tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is stainless steel. Outer tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be made from non-thermally conductive materials, or comprise one or more layers of thermally insulating materials. It is also preferred that the surfaces of auger blade <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> be smooth. Cleaning solution (not shown) is also introduced into inner tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via receptacle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for the automatic cleaning cycle using control panel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. However, manual cleaning of auger assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can also be an alternative, by removal of cover <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, dispensing head assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the end cap <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> from freezing chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Also, it is contemplated for auger assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be made from components that are dishwasher safe. Further, when any automated cycle is complete, although not shown, the present invention can comprise any known means of audible or visual signaling, such as an LED light, to let a user know that the soft frozen product is ready for consumption. Although not limited thereto, an embodiment of present invention <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a housing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having a width dimension of approximately eight inches, a height dimension of approximately 16 inches, a depth dimension of less than eighteen inches, and weighing less than fifty pounds, would be able to produce approximately thirty ounces of frozen product with each cycle. The type of consumable product created with the present invention is only limited by one&apos;s imagination and can include frozen coffee, teas, adult drinks, slush beverages, milk shakes, frozen yogurt and yogurt based beverages, as well as soft serve ice cream and other soft frozen dessert concoctions. The present invention is low cost, takes up little space, and has easy maintenance. In addition to domestic use, it can also be used in convenience stores, gas stations, cafeterias, hospitals, offices, bars, and restaurants. </paragraph>
