<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to illuminators and indicators, and to improved vehicle components and assemblies incorporating a semiconductor radiation emitter package. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Vehicles include a number of different components and assemblies that have an illuminator and/or a signal lamp associated therewith. Great interest has been shown in the use of electroluminescent semiconductor devices, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), as illuminators and signal indicators because they offer many potential advantages as compared to other conventional low voltage light sources. Other light sources suffer from many deficiencies, including: they are relatively inefficient, such as conventional tungsten incandescent lamps; require high voltages to operate, such as fluorescent and gas discharge lamps; or are susceptible to damage, such as incandescent lamps. Accordingly, these alternate light sources are not optimal for vehicular applications where only limited power or low voltage is available, or where high voltage is unacceptable for safety reasons, or in applications where there is significant shock or vibration. LEDs, on the other hand, are highly shock resistant, and therefore provide significant advantages over incandescent and fluorescent bulbs, which can shatter when subjected to mechanical or thermal shock. LEDs also possess operating lifetimes from 200,000 hours to 1,000,000 hours, as compared to the typical 1,000 to 2,000 hours for incandescent lamps or 5,000 to 10,000 hours for fluorescent lamps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Because of these and other advantages, LEDs have become common in a wide variety of opto-electronic applications. Visible LEDs of all colors, including white, are used as status indicators within instrument panels and consoles in cars, trucks, buses, minivans, sport utility vehicles, aircraft, and the like. In each of these applications, the low intensity luminous flux emitted by the LEDs limits the relative visibility of the indicator, particularly in high ambient lighting conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> High intensity amber, red, and red-orange emitting visible LEDs are used in integrated arrays of visual signaling systems such as vehicle CHMSLs (center high mounted stop lamps), brake lamps, exterior turn signals and hazard flashers, exterior signaling mirrors, and the like. In each of these applications, the limited luminous flux emitted by the individual discrete LEDs within the array requires the simultaneous operation of eight or more discrete LEDs in order to achieve the desired beam intensity and distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Multi-color combinations of pluralities of high intensity visible colored LEDs are being used as the source of projected white light for illumination purposes. Such illuminators are useful as vehicle or aircraft map lights, for example, or as vehicle or aircraft reading or courtesy lights, cargo lights, license plate illuminators, back-up lights, and exterior mirror puddle lights. Phosphor-enhanced &ldquo;white&rdquo; LEDs may also be used in some of these instances as illuminators. In these illuminator applications, where high beam intensity is critical to production of effective projected illumination, the limited luminous flux emitted by the individual discrete LEDs requires the simultaneous operation of many discrete LEDs in order to achieve desired beam intensity, color, and distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Infrared (IR) emitting LEDs are being used for remote control and communication in such devices as VCRs, TVs, DVD players, CD players, and other audio-visual remote control units. Similarly, high intensity IR emitting LEDs are being used for communication between IRDA devices such as desktop, laptop, and palmtop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and peripherals such as printers, network adaptors, pointing devices (&ldquo;mice,&rdquo; &ldquo;trackballs&rdquo;, etc.), keyboards, and the like. Signal range and quality are dependent on the magnitude of flux generated by the LED emitter, and the limited flux has had a detrimental impact on performance of these existing IR transmitters, let alone designing IR LEDs into other systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In all of the applications discussed herein above, the limited magnitude of flux generated by the semiconductor emitter package has had a detrimental impact on the performance, design, size, weight, flexibility, cost, and other aspects of the devices in which they are employed. Consequently, much effort has been expended to develop higher intensity LEDs. Despite increases in luminous output that have been achieved as a result of these efforts, and despite all of the efforts expended to develop products that improve the performance of LEDs incorporated therein, high luminescent LEDs and the products that employ them suffer from high cost, high complexity, limited current capacity, and/or incompatibility with common manufacturing processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An exemplary application in an automotive environment wherein LEDs have imparted serious limitations on design and performance is a vehicle signal mirror. Signal mirrors generally employ one or more lamps in a mirror assembly to generate an information signal. In general, outside signal mirrors have employed a lamp assembly positioned either behind a dichroic mirror, such that the signal light passes through the mirror, or on the rearview mirror body housing, such that the signal lamp is independent of the mirror. Examples of such signal mirrors can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,361,190; 5,788,357; and 5,497,306. Even though signal mirrors incorporating LED signal lamps are gaining popularity, these mirrors have not yet received widespread acceptance. This limited acceptance may be due at least in part to the large volume, complexity, significant weight, and the high cost of implementing outside signal mirrors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Outside rearview mirrors typically include a body housing mounted to the vehicle, a mirror assembly, and an adjustable support mechanism carrying the mirror assembly such that the driver can adjust the mirror angle. It is also common to provide other components in the mirror body housing such as one or more antennas (for accessories such as remote keyless entry), a motor for adjusting the mirror angle, and in some instances electronic circuitry. In direct conflict with this desire to provide a multitude of components in the outside rearview mirror body housing is the desire of vehicle designers to make the rearview mirrors as small and as aerodynamic as possible to minimize the mirror&apos;s impact on wind noise and vehicle styling. Consequently there is not a significant volume available within the mirror housing for additional components to be placed. In addition, it is desirable to make the weight of the mirror as light as possible to reduce vibration and its associated detrimental impact on rear vision. For these reasons, designers are presented with a significant challenge when attempting to design a signal mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,361,190, entitled &ldquo;MIRROR ASSEMBLY,&rdquo; issued on Nov. 1, 1994, to John K. Roberts et al. illustrates an LED signal mirror. The 5,361,190 patent discloses a through-the-mirror signal indicator wherein a light source is positioned behind a dichroic mirror. The dichroic mirror passes light within a spectral band and attenuates light outside that spectral band. The light source positioned behind the dichroic mirror emits light in the spectral pass band of the dichroic mirror, such that a visual signal from the light source can be seen from the front of the mirror. However, the mirror will attenuate light which is not within the narrow pass band of the dichroic mirror. Although the ability to pass light through the entire area of the mirror is a significant advantage, there are several disadvantages to the dichroic signal mirrors that have restricted its commercial exploitation. These signal mirrors employ a large array of LEDs to generate the light signal. Such an LED array is heavy, necessitating substantial support structure for the rearview mirror, and costly. In addition, the LED array is large, requiring a large mirror body to accommodate the array, let alone the other mirror components of the mirror. Another significant disadvantage to dichroic mirrors is that they are expensive to manufacture, difficult to mass produce, and subject to performance variations as they age. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,788,357, entitled &ldquo;MIRROR ASSEMBLY,&rdquo; and issued to Muth et al. on Aug. 4, 1998, discloses a semitransparent mirror signal light assembly. The U.S. Pat. No. 5,788,357 describes efforts to overcome the inherent physical characteristics of earlier dichroic mirrors, such as the signal mirror disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,361,190. In particular, the U.S. Pat. No. 5,788,357 points out that the cost of producing dichroic mirrors is too high. Additionally, the U.S. Pat. No. 5,788,357 attempts to address the difficulties of providing a dichroic mirror with acceptable reflectivity and heat dissipation while maintaining adequate luminescence and a neutral chromatic appearance. In particular, the U.S. Pat. No. 5,788,357 employs a through-the-mirror arrangement using a semitransparent, non-dichroic mirror having a light source positioned behind it. The semitransparent mirror transmits about 1 percent to about 8 percent of a broad band of visible light. Like the U.S. Pat. No. 5,361,190, for LED signal lamps, the patent discloses a large bank of LEDs mounted on a substrate of relatively large dimension. Thus, the lamp array is heavy, requiring substantial structural support for the mirror, which will limit the types of applications in which the mirror can be used. In order to avoid the large LED array, the U.S. Pat. No. 5,788,357 teaches use of lamps other than LEDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,497,306, entitled &ldquo;EXTERIOR VEHICLE SECURITY LIGHT,&rdquo; issued on Mar. 5, 1996, to Todd Pastrick, discloses a signal mirror assembly including a lamp module mounted on the body housing of the exterior rearview mirror. The principle embodiment illustrates the difficulties encountered when attempting to accommodate an incandescent lamp. In particular the U.S. Pat. No. 5,497,306 shows a lamp housing assembly, which is removably attached to the exterior mirror body housing to facilitate replacement and maintenance of the signal lamp. Such an arrangement is costly, large, and restricts the designer&apos;s design flexibility. In addition, this design necessitates a redesign of the mirror housing to provide enough volume to accommodate the mirror, the removable light module, and any associated electronics. Enlarging the mirror housing is exactly what the auto manufacturers are trying to avoid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> These difficulties encountered when designing a signal mirror are representative of the types of problems encountered in many other components and assemblies employing LEDs. What is needed are components and assemblies producing brighter, stronger, and/or more easily discernible illumination and/or signals, and in many applications, such producing better illumination and/or signals in a compact volume.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Improved components and assemblies incorporate a semiconductor radiation emission package, such as an LED, and produce a strong readily visible signal indicator, a strong communication signal, and/or bright illumination. Additionally, means are provided in some of the components and assemblies to increase the output of the semiconductor radiation emission package or otherwise improve the performance of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A signal mirror <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is mounted on a vehicle A. &ldquo;Signal mirror,&rdquo; as used herein, refers to a mirror associated with a signal lamp to generate a signal visible to an observer. An example of one significant advantage that can be achieved by such a signaling device is evident from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, wherein vehicle A includes an outside signal mirror <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The driver of vehicle B is positioned in what is commonly referred to as the blind spot for the driver of vehicle A. Additionally, the driver of vehicle B is unlikely to see the rear turn signal lamp <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> being well outside of the optimum viewing area D for that signal lamp. A signal indicator that generates a signal discernable in viewing area C is therefore advantageous as the driver of vehicle B can be alerted to vehicle A&apos;s driver&apos;s intent to change lanes, and can take appropriate action to avoid an accident responsive thereto. </paragraph>

The illustrated signal mirror <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes, from left to right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>: a rearview mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>; a puddle LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> positioned under an overhang <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in the mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>; a female connector <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>; a support bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for the mirror; a vehicle body mounting bracket <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>; a motor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for adjusting the angle of the mirror; a carrier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> on which the mirror is supported; an optional mirror circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>; a heater <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime;; an illuminator circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>; a signal indicator LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>; a heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>; a mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>; and a bezel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the vehicle includes: a mirror position controller <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>; a controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> coupled to receive inputs from an ambient light sensor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, a glare sensor <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, a brake actuator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and a turn signal actuator <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>; and a heater control circuit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that although the illustrated signal mirror is outside of the vehicle adjacent the driver&apos;s seat, a signal mirror can be inside the vehicle or mounted at any location on the exterior of the vehicle, and it will be further recognized that the signal mirror can include additional elements and functionality, or consist only of a mirror and lamp, and as used herein, signal mirror will refer to any signal indicator in combination with a mirror or a mirror housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Somewhat more particularly, the rearview mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is typically an enclosure which is shaped taking into consideration the style of vehicle A (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to which it is attached as well as general aerodynamic principles, serving the primary functions of providing functional and aesthetic styling, and protecting the mirror components from flying objects, such as stones. The rearview mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) can be molded from a polymer, stamped from a metal or metal alloy, or of any other suitable conventional manufacture. The exterior of the rearview mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is typically painted to match the color of vehicle A and covered with a clear coat finish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The rearview mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> includes an overhang <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Although the illustrated overhang is at the top front of the housing, the housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can extend in other directions, or include other projections, to which the LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be attached. It will be recognized that because of the LED lamp&apos;s small profile, it can be accommodated at virtually any location on the mirror with minimal modification of the mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. An LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is positioned under the overhang to project light downwardly and forwardly so as to illuminate the area behind the mirror and adjacent to the door of vehicle A. The puddle LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is connected to a female connector <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, which is in turn electrically connected to optional printed circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> via cable <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, or if the optional printed circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is omitted, the cable <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> can extend from the connector <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> directly to the controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to receive control signals therefrom. The connector <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> can contain therein a circuit to protect the LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> from potentially damaging voltages. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is a high power LED lamp. In particular, the LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be implemented using a phosphor emitter, red-green-blue emitters, or binary complimentary colored emitters, which when combined produce white light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A variety of components and assemblies are described herein that improve the performance of LED lamps. Although these components and assemblies can enhance the performance of any LED lamp, the LED lamps used are preferably high power LED lamps. &ldquo;High power LED lamp&rdquo; as used herein is an LED package, without auxiliary components, wherein 90 percent of the LED power at peak light intensity is at least approximately 0.1 Watt. Additionally, any of the components and assemblies described herein can advantageously be implemented using an LED lamp having a heat extraction member. Particularly advantageous LED lamps, according to which the LED lamps herein are preferably manufactured, designed to optimize heat extraction and manufacturability into a component or assembly, are described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/426,795 entitled &ldquo;SEMICONDUCTOR RADIATION EMITTER PACKAGE,&rdquo; and filed on Oct. 22, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,548, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. These LED lamps can be implemented using a semiconductor optical radiation emitter, such as an organic light emitter or a polymer light emitter, and in particular can include one, or more than one, emitter, and &ldquo;LED lamp&rdquo; as used herein includes any semiconductor optical radiation emitter package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The rearview mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> partially encloses a support bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, which is attached to the vehicle A (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) using mounting bracket <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The support bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the mounting bracket <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are constructed and attached through conventional means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Motor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is mounted on support bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Motor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is optional, and can be provided by any suitable conventional mechanism of the type commercially available to adjust the position of the mirror subassembly responsive to control signals received from a conventional mirror position controller <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The control signals are input to the motor from the position control controller <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> via cable <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The control signals are typically generated using switches located in the door or center console of vehicle A, which switches are positioned to be accessible to the driver. Alternatively, the motor and mirror position controller can be replaced by a ball and socket support, which permits the mirror angle to be adjusted by manual manipulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The mirror subassembly <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> includes, from left to right: the carrier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>; an optional mirror circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>; a heater <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>; an LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>; an optional lamp circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>; an optional heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>; a mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>; and a bezel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The carrier plate is preferably formed of a molded polymer, although it can be of any suitable conventional manufacture such as stamped from a metal or metal alloy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The mirror circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is optional, and can be omitted, for example, where the signal mirror <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> does not include a significant amount of circuitry. If included, the circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> can be either a flexible circuit board or a rigid circuit board. The circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> can have one or more integrated circuit (IC) components mounted thereto by conventional means, such as surface mounted, or mounted to through-holes, also known as vias, using soldering or other techniques, and is preferably a thin printed circuit board to reduce the thickness and weight of the mirror subassembly <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. A mirror subassembly including a circuit board is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/312,682, entitled &ldquo;EXTERIOR MIRROR SUBASSMEBLY WITH COMBINED ELECTRONIC CIRCUITRY AND MIRROR ELEMENT,&rdquo; filed on May 17, 1999, by Timothy E. Steenwyk, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,244,716, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The optional heater <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime; can be of any suitable construction. More particularly, the heater <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime; can be a resistive conductor having an adhesive on one surface, or opposite surfaces, thereof. The resistive conductor generates heat when a current is applied thereto. The resistive conductor implementation of heater <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime; can be applied to the back surface of mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, applied to two-sided tape, mounted on optional mirror printed circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, or etched in a conductive surface of mirror circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is a high power LED, and preferably an LED lamp using one or more red-orange emitter chip. In the illustrated embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are provided for the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. As described in greater detail below, the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are connected to increase heat dissipation from the LED lamp, the LED lamp is mounted to circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, and the circuit board is mounted to the carrier plate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> using a mechanical attachment mechanism such as snap connectors, an adhesive, or other conventional means. The circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is used to electrically connect the LED lamp to controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> via circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and cable <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Alternatively, the cable <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be connected directly to circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> if circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is not used. The controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> generates control signals for the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> responsive to the brake actuator <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and/or the turn signal actuator <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and in particular, flashing signals when the left turn signal is ON and a continuous signal when the driver presses the brake actuator while the turn signal is not on. It will be recognized that the right turn signal will be repeated in a signal lamp on the passenger side of the vehicle A. It will also be recognized that the signal lamp circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be directly connected to the vehicle electrical system to receive the turn signal and stop lamp signals, and circuits for providing such a connection are described in greater detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> can be flat, aspheric, or convex. The mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> can be a non-electrochromic, single element mirror having a reflector on the first or second surface. Such mirrors are often constructed of a transparent element, such as glass or a polymeric material, with a reflective coating such as chrome, silver, or the like serving as the reflector. Alternatively, the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> can be an electrochromic mirror, which offers the significant advantage of being able to automatically adjust its reflectivity to reduce glare at night and to provide a high level of reflectivity during the day, when glare is not a significant problem. Electrochromic mirrors amplify the difficulty of providing a signal mirror as the LED lamp has to transmit through two pieces of glass, at least one transparent conductive material, and an electrochromic medium, in addition to the reflector or dichroic coatings, as described in greater detail hereinbelow. Electrochromic devices are generally known, and examples of electrochromic devices and associated circuitry, some of which are commercially available, are disclosed in Byker U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,108; Bechtel et al. Canadian Patent No. 1,300,945; Bechtel U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,778; Byker U.S. Pat. No. 5,280,380; Byker U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,448; Bauer et al. U.S. Pat.

No. 5,689,370; Tonar et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,431; and Bechtel et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,822. Each of these patents is commonly assigned with the present invention and the disclosures of each, including the references contained therein, are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Such electrochromic devices may be utilized in a fully integrated inside/outside rearview mirror system or as separate inside or outside rearview mirror systems. Alternatively, the mirror can be a dichroic mirror, examples of which are also referenced above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> controls the reflectance of the electrochromic mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and optionally provides control signals to control LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can advantageously be implemented using one or more microcontrollers and associated circuitry, and may, for example, be an interior rearview mirror controller of the type associated with an electrochromic rearview mirror commonly mounted to the vehicle windshield, and the external mirror can receive control signals therefrom. The controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is coupled to an ambient light sensor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, which typically faces forwardly of the vehicle, and a glare sensor <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, which typically faces rearwardly to sense the light coming from the rear of the vehicle. The controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can generate control signals for both the interior electrochromic mirror (such as mirror <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>) and the exterior electrochromic mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Electrochromic mirror controllers are disclosed in: Canadian Patent No. 1,300,945, entitled &ldquo;AUTOMATIC REARVIEW MIRROR SYSTEM FOR AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLES&rdquo;, issued May 19, 1992, to Jon H. Bechtel et al.; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/825,768, entitled &ldquo;SERIES DRIVE CIRCUIT,&rdquo; filed by Robert R. Turnbull et al. on Sep. 16, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,012; and PCT Application No. PCT/US97/16946, entitled &ldquo;INDIVIDUAL MIRROR CONTROL SYSTEM,&rdquo; filed by Robert C. Knapp et al. on Sep. 16, 1997; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/236,969, entitled &ldquo;AUTOMATIC DIMMING MIRROR USING SEMICONDUCTOR LIGHT SENSOR WITH INTEGRAL CHARGE COLLECTION&rdquo;, filed May 7, 1999, by Jon H. Bechtel et al, now abandoned, the disclosures of which are incorporated by herein by reference. Regardless of the type of mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, the bezel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to fit over and circumscribe the perimeter edge of the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The bezel can be of any suitable construction, such as molded of an organic polymer, stamped from a metal or metal alloy, or the like. When assembled to the carrier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the bezel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and carrier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> support, frame, and protect the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, as well as the components associated therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that the electrical conductors <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, can be provided by conventional conductors, such as copper wires having individual insulated sleeves and bundled together in a wire harness (not shown) running from the vehicle through the mirror mounting structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The signal mirror <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is exemplified having a large number of components to illustrate the small volume that mirror designers have available for a signal lamp. It is desirable to provide a large number of components within the mirror for utility, safety and convenience reasons, even though a large volume is required to accommodate a large number of components. In particular: the motor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> permits driver adjustment of the mirror position for improved visibility without having to open the window and stretch to physically contact the mirror while operating the vehicle; the electrochromic mirror improves the drivers visibility by attenuating headlight glare from other vehicles at night and providing a substantially unattenuated reflection during daylight hours thereby improving rearward visibility; the heater <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime; improves visibility through the rearview mirror by clearing the mirror of moisture such as ice and condensation; and the signal lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> increases the likelihood that drivers of other vehicles will be alerted by the signaling system of vehicle A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A substantial volume must also be provided in the mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> if the mirror is to have significant freedom of movement for adjusting the mirror angle to reflect the driver&apos;s desired field of vision. In direct conflict with this need for more volume in the mirror body housing is the desire to make mirror assemblies as small as possible. Two principle reasons for making the mirror as small as possible include improved aerodynamics, and reduced wind noise. Accordingly there is a need to reduce the volume of signal mirror <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> required by the components in the mirror without reducing the features in the mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> effects a low profile, very bright puddle light illuminator, and LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> effects a small volume, very bright signal lamp in mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> includes a heat extraction member <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) operative to reduce the temperature of the LED lamp by providing a low thermal resistance between the junction and ambient as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,548 incorporated herein by reference. The heat extraction member is partially covered by an encapsulant <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, which encapsulant is transparent and includes a lens <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. One or more emitter <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is mounted to the heat extraction member <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> under the lens, such attachment being by bonding, for example, and in particular a thermally conductive bonding material can be used. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> further includes high thermal resistance electrical leads <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. The electrical leads <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are connected to the emitter, or emitters, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and, in particular, the illustrated three lead LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> has multiple emitters. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> can have two leads, or more than three leads, and that the three lead LED lamp is merely illustrative. In the illustrated example, where the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> has two emitters, electrical lead <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> can be connected to the anode of one emitter and electrical lead <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> can be connected to the anode of the other emitter. The electrical lead <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> can be coupled to the cathode of both emitters through the heat extraction member as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Such an arrangement permits application of respective control signals for the emitters. Each of the electrical leads <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> has a high thermal resistance relative to the heat extraction member, such that the leads can be assembled in a device using known production techniques, such as surface mounting, radial insertion, axial insertion, wave soldering, hand soldering, and/or other conventional manufacturing processes, even if substantial amounts of heat are applied to the leads during the process, without harming the LED lamp. LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is of a similar construction, except as mentioned above and has an emitter to produce white light instead of red-orange light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Each of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> can be used with or without a heat sink. The puddle LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is illustrated mounted directly to the lower surface of the overhang <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and may be mounted using an adhesive, two-sided tape, an integral connector such as a snap connector, or any other suitable connector. The housing itself can provide a heat sink for heat generated by the lamp during illumination. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is mounted on a heat sink to significantly increase its power handling capabilities, and thus the amount of light that it is capable of emitting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, it is advantageous for the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to be packaged as a small module <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> including a circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and a heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> can be of any suitable conventional type, although it is preferably a rigid circuit board. The circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> includes vias <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> for receipt of leads <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. The leads <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are inserted into the vias by automated equipment, such as radial insertion equipment, and then soldered, by methods such as wave soldering. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other manufacturing techniques can be used, and that the described manufacturing techniques are merely exemplary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> on circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> has components for an LED driver that protects the LED and controls the magnitude of the current input thereto. The circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> mounted on circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> will be described in greater detail hereinbelow with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>. It will be recognized that the circuit could be mounted elsewhere, such as on circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, or elsewhere on the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a passive heat sink including a back wall <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> spacing a plurality of fins <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. The back wall spaces the fins for easier assembly and provides a thermal conduit from the heat extraction member of the LED lamp to the fins. The fins <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> have a large surface area to dissipate heat, which increases dissipation of heat from the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, thereby increasing the amount of power that can be applied to the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> without damaging the LED lamp, which in turn increases the amount of light that the LED lamp can produce. The heat sink can be of any suitable construction, and as will be described in greater detail hereinbelow, the heat sink can be active or passive. A passive heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, such as that illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, can be stamped from a metal or metal alloy, and preferably a metal alloy having a low thermal resistance and being light in weight. The heat sink can be manufactured from copper, brass, BeCu, aluminum, an aluminum alloy, or other metals or ceramics having good thermal conduction properties. Alternatively, active heat sinks can be employed, such as the Peltier cooler described below. The heat sink can be implemented using a phase change heat sink. It is also envisioned that in some applications, a fan could be provided to significantly increase heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The fastener <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, which is illustrated as a conventional screw of the type manufactured from nylon, metal or a metal alloy, physically secures the heat extraction member <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> against the heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> can be attached to the heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> using a thermally conductive adhesive, an adhesive tape, or any other suitable conventional coupling means providing a thermal path from the heat extraction member of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to the heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As described in greater detail in the above-referenced co-pending U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,548, by providing improved thermal dissipation, the heat characteristics of the emitter, or emitters, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> producing the radiation emitted from the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, are significantly improved. This is particularly advantageous in a signal mirror, as the ability to use a high power LED <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> instead of incandescent lamps or a large array of LEDs, enables implementation of a lighter signal indicator that does not consume a large volume within the mirror. High power LEDs are also advantageous in electrochromic mirrors even if there is room for a large signal indicator because brighter LED lamps permit a thicker transflective coating to be used, giving the window area of the mirror improved reflectance and sheet resistance, which can improve the performance of the mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The puddle LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is mounted directly to the mirror housing without a heat sink in the illustrated embodiment for two reasons: the puddle light will produce enough light in low ambient light conditions without a heat sink, and the profile of the LED lamp is lower without the heat sink, allowing the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> to move freely under the lamp even without a large gap between the mirror and the mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. If the mirror body housing is <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is metal, the housing itself will operate as a passive heat sink. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is connected to the connector <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, as indicated above. The connector <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> can be implemented as described in greater detail with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is assembled into the mirror assembly <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> as follows. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and the circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> are mounted on the carrier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> using an adhesive, an adhesive tape, mechanical fasteners such as integral snap connectors or screws, or the like. The surface <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> in recess <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> of carrier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is preferably oriented such that the LED lamp module mounted in parallel therewith will be at the desired angle with respect to the surface of mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> after the mirror assembly <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is fully assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In the alternative, the heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> can be mounted to the rear surface <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> of a rear element <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> of mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> using an adhesive, an adhesive tape or the like. In this alternative structure, the heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is used as a mounting structure for supporting the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> on the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, orients the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> at a desired angle with respect to the back surface of mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The desired angle, &agr;, is generally known in the art to be 0-70&deg;, and preferably approximately 20-50&deg; for the signal indicator to be visible in field C (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Because glass is a reasonably good thermal conductor, it will help dissipate heat from the heat sink. If more thermal conductivity is desired, polished stainless steel or a metal heat sink made of copper, aluminum, or the like, could be laminated to a large surface area of the glass to help dissipate heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The mirror subassembly <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, and in particular mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and its relationship with LED <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to provide a signal mirror or an illuminator, will now be described in greater detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Because some of the layers of the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are very thin, the scale of the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in the figures is distorted for pictorial clarity. In addition, for clarity of description of such a structure, the front surface of the front glass element (right-most surface in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) is sometimes referred to as the first surface, and the inside surface of the front glass element is sometimes referred to as the second surface. The inside surface of the rear glass element is sometimes referred to as the third surface, and the back surface of the rear glass element is sometimes referred to as the fourth surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> There are two general types of electrochromic mirrors: third and fourth surface reflectors. The structure of the third surface reflector can have a wide variety of structures depending on the specific characteristics desired both for the electrochromic mirror as a whole and for the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> in particular. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> illustrate some of these various constructions. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9, 12</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> illustrate some of the various constructions of fourth surface reflectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the illustrated mirror subassembly <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> includes, from left to right: the carrier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>; optional circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>; heater <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime;; LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>; a rear transparent mirror element <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>; a reflector/electrode <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>; an electrochromic medium <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>; a front transparent conductive material <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>; an optional color suppression material <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>; and a front transparent element <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the reflector/electrode material of layer <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> comprises one or more layers which may be a wide variety of metals, oxides and metal oxides, such as chromium, chromium-molybdenum-nickel alloys, nickel-iron-chromium alloys, silicon, tantalum, stainless steel, titanium nickel, rhodium, molybdenum, silver, silver alloys, platinum, palladium, gold, or combinations thereof. Further useful materials are discussed below. Reflector/electrode may have one or more underlayers <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> to improve certain characteristics, such as the bond strength to the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> further includes an electrochromic medium <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> disposed in a chamber defined by the reflector/electrode <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, the layer of transparent conductive material <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, and a seal material (not shown) disposed around an inner perimeter of the coatings on the transparent elements. The mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> includes a layer <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> of transparent conductive material deposited on the rear surface of front element <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> (second surface) optionally having one or more color suppression under-layers <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The transparent elements of mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are generally glass, but may be made using materials and techniques as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/311,955, entitled &ldquo;ELECTROCHROMIC REARVIEW MIRROR INCORPORATING A THIRD SURFACE METAL REFLECTOR AND A DISPLAY/SIGNAL LIGHT,&rdquo; filed on May 14, 1999, by William L. Tonar et al., now U.S. Pat. No. 6,356,376, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> formed in a reflective layer <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> of reflector/electrode <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is aligned with the peak intensity optical axis <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> of lens <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> such that light emitted by LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> will pass through window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and generate the indicator signal. The window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> can be formed by any conventional means, such as laser etched using a 50 Watt Nd: YAG laser, such as that made by XCEL Control Laser, located in Orlando, Fla.; or by mechanical scraping, chemical etching, sandblasting, masking during coating, etc. The overall shape of the window can be: round; elliptical; square; directional such as an arrow, arrowhead or an array of openings together forming a directional arrow; or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, it can be seen that the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> may include interleaved openings <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and reflective strips <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>. Even though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> only shows the interleaved openings through layer <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, it will be understood that these openings may extend though one or more of the intermediate layers <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> and may extend all the way through to the transparent substrate <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Although it is contemplated that all of the reflector/electrode may be removed from window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> (thereby leaving no interleaved openings), such a design will cause difficulties in that there will be coloration variations in the electrochromic medium between the window areas <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and the remaining portion of the mirror where the reflector/electrode is not removed. In portions of the electrochromic mirror away from the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> there is one electrochromic material oxidized at one electrode for every corresponding electrochromic material reduced at the other electrode, such that the mirror has a uniform color. However, if the window area is devoid of any reflector/electrode, the oxidation or reduction (depending on the polarity of the electrodes) that occurs on the second surface electrode <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> directly across from window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> will occur uniformly distributed, but the reduction or oxidation on the third surface will not be uniform due to the missing electrode region. Rather than being uniform, the generation of light-absorbing species will be concentrated at the edges of the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> region thereby creating aesthetically unappealing color discrepancies visible to the driver. By providing reflector/electrode strips <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> in the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> area of the mirror, the generation of light absorbing species (at the second and third surfaces) in the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> area will be much closer to the uniformity seen in the other regions of the mirror having completely balanced electrodes. It is therefore preferred that there be either portions of the window that have the reflector/electrode present and other portions that do not, or that the reflector/electrode be designed in such a manner that it provides adequate conductivity for the electrochromic reactions to proceed in a uniform manner while still allowing sufficient transmission to operate as a signal mirror with LED <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the window regions <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> devoid of reflective material constitute more than 50 percent of the opening along the center axis of the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, whereas the area <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> occupied by the reflective material can exceed 50 percent along the perimeter. The illustrated openings are elliptical (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), but alternatively, the sides of the reflective strip edges may be straight, or have a larger radius in the center than at the ends, or the strips may not extend across the entire height of the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, such that the strips <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> alternately extend into the opening from the top edge and the bottom edge of the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. By providing reflective strips <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> that are narrower at the center of the window than at the edge, the conductive field necessary for the electrochromic function that will minimize discoloration can be provided while minimizing the obstruction of the signal beam from LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> in the most vital zone, namely the center of the window. Optimized transmittance of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> emissions can thus be achieved without detrimentally impacting the coloring of electrochromic mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in the region of window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The reflectance of the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> may be further controlled by varying the percentage of the areas that are devoid of reflective material, e.g., varying the width of the reflective strips <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, or by varying the thickness of the reflector/electrode (discussed in more detail below). Further, the reflector electrode material used to form the reflective strips <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> in the signal light area <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> may be different from the reflector electrode material used for the remainder of the mirror. For example, a reflector electrode material having a higher reflectance may be used in the signal lamp area <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, reflector/electrode <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> need not have reflective strips, but rather can have a window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> with a continuous layer of conductive material. For example, reflector/electrode <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> may include a coating <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> of a first base layer <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> applied directly to the front surface of rear transparent element <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, and an intermediate second layer <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> deposited on first layer <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. First layer <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and second layer <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> are preferably made of materials having relatively low sheet resistivity, and that are at least partially transmissive. The materials forming layers <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> may also be partially reflective. If the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> behind the partially transmissive window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> must be viewed often in bright ambient conditions or direct sunlight, it may be desirable to keep the reflectivity of the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> area to a minimum by using metals with low reflectivity, or other dark, black or transparent coatings that are electrically conductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The material forming layer <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> should exhibit adequate binding characteristics to glass or other materials of which transparent element <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> may be formed, while the material forming layer <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> should exhibit adequate properties to bond to the material of layer <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and provide a good bond between an applied layer <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> and the peripheral seal <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Thus, the material used for layer <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is preferably a material selected from the group consisting essentially of: chromium, chromium-molybdenum-nickel alloys, nickel-iron-chromium alloys, silicon, tantalum, stainless steel, and titanium. In the most preferred embodiment, layer <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is made of chromium. The material used to form second layer <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is preferably a material selected from the group consisting essentially of, but not limited to: molybdenum, rhodium, nickel, tungsten, tantalum, stainless-steel, gold, titanium, and alloys thereof. In the most preferred embodiment, second layer <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is formed of nickel, rhodium, and molybdenum. If first layer <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is formed of chromium, layer <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> preferably has a thickness between 5 angstroms and 15 angstroms. In particular, it is envisioned that the thickness of layer <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is selected based upon the material used so as to allow between 10 to 50 percent light transmittance through both of layers <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>. Thus, for a second layer <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> formed of rhodium, nickel, or molybdenum, or a combination thereof, layer <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is preferably between 50 and 150 angstroms. While the thickness of layers <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is preferably selected to be thin enough to provide adequate transmittance, it must also be thick enough to provide for adequate electrical conductivity so as to sufficiently clear or darken electrochromic media <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> in the proximity of window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. The layer <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> should thus have a sheet resistivity of less than 100 Ohms/square, and preferably less than 60 Ohms/square. Layer <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> could also be a transparent conductor, such as ITO, in which case a reflective layer can be applied over the transparent conductor layer except for the window area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The metals used in forming coating <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> contribute to the total reflectance of reflector/electrode <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the layer of the reflective material <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> need not be made as thick as would be required if layers <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> are replaced by a single coating layer. For example, for silver or silver alloys used to form layer <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> in the multiple electrode mirror, the thickness is between 50 angstroms and 150 angstroms, whereas the thickness of reflective layer <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> would need to be between 30 angstroms and 800 angstroms if layers <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> are replaced by a single layer. By including layers <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, some of the costs associated with providing the reflective layer <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> can be reduced. Further, the use of reflective metals in forming coating <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> provides for a degree of reflectance within window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, thereby providing a much more aesthetically pleasing appearance than if window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> were devoid of any reflective material whatsoever. Ideally, coating <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> provides between 30 and 40 percent reflectivity in window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. If the reflectance in window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> is too high, bright light will tend to wash out the signal from the lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, in the sense that the sun might eliminate the contrast between the light of the signal lamp and the light reflecting outwardly from coating <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> It will be recognized from the above discussion that there is a trade-off between reflectance and transmittance, such that a window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> with higher transmittance will pass more light, but will not reflect as well. Additionally, there is a trade-off between transmittance and sheet resistance, as thicker electrode layers provide lower sheet resistance. Lower sheet resistance improves electrochromic media performance both in terms of fast transition times and uniformity of color and clearing. Providing thicker electrodes thus improves sheet resistance at the expense of transmittance. Using the high power LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, which is disclosed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,548, a mass producible signal mirror can be achieved having a thicker reflector/electrode layer in the window area, producing better reflectance and sheet resistance, while the signal indicator still produces bright light levels visible both at night and during the day. In addition, by utilizing the preferred lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> one can, for a desired light output use thicker layers for the reflector/electrode and provide improved coloring and clearing speed and uniformity, or one can keep the reflector/electrode layer dimensions the same and provide enhanced light for signaling or illumination. By utilizing heat sinks to increase the light output, a single LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> can be effectively used to provide a signal mirror even in an electrochromic mirror using a transflective coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Another alternative arrangement for the electrochromic mirror is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The construction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is essentially the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, except that a thin silver or silver alloy layer <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is formed on conductive coating <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> within window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. By providing only a thin layer <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> of reflective material in window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, adequate transmittance may still be provided through window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, while increasing the reflectivity and electrical conductivity in that area. Layer <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> may have a thickness between 40 and 150 angstroms, whereas the layer of reflective material <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> in the other areas of the mirror may have a thickness on the order of between 200 and 1000 angstroms. The thin layer <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> of reflective material may be formed by initially masking the area of window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> while applying a portion of reflective layer <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and then removing the mask during deposition of the remainder of layer <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. Conversely, a thin layer of reflective material may first be deposited and then a mask may be applied over window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> while the remainder of reflective layer <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> is deposited. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the window may be formed in layer <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> without masking by depositing reflective layer <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> to its full thickness and subsequently removing a portion of layer <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> in the region of window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> A modification of the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> may be made simply by making layers <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> constituting conductive coating <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> thinner in the region behind window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. As such, thin layer <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> may have a thickness of between 5 and 50 angstroms, whereas layer <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> otherwise would have a thickness anywhere between 100 and 1000 angstrom. Similarly, layer <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> may be made of the same material, but with a thickness of between 50 and 150 angstroms, while layer <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> would otherwise have a thickness on the order of 100 to 1000 angstroms. Thus, with this alternative construction, the sheet resistance, reflectance, and transmittance within the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> may be optimized while enabling the sheet resistance and reflectance in the other regions to be optimized without concern as to the transmittance in the region of window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> coating <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> may be any one or a combination of a light control film, a layer of black or dark paint, and a heater. A light control film, such as that available from the 3M Company under the trade designation LCF-P, may be used, which is a thin plastic film enclosing a plurality of closely spaced, black-colored micro louvers. Such a light control film is disclosed for use in a conventional signal mirror in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,361,190 and 5,788,357, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. As disclosed in those patents, such a light control film may have a thickness of 0.030 inch, with microlouvers spaced approximately 0.005 inch apart. The microlouvers are typically black, and are at various angular positions to provide a suitable viewing angle. Such a light control film permits light from LED <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to be transmitted at the appropriate viewing angle to be visible in region C (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) even if the lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is mounted parallel to the mirror surface such that the peak intensity optical axis of the lamp is orthogonal to the mirror before the light emitted thereby strikes the light control film. The light control film also serves to block the light projected from LED <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> against traveling outside the appropriate viewing angle C into the line of sight of the driver of vehicle A. The light control film may thus be placed completely over and in front of the surface of the mirror in the illumination line of LED <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. Further, such a light control film can be made using other forms of optical elements, such as holograms and the like. Alternatively, the element <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> can be a reflective grating, a prism, a holographic optical element, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> If element <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> is a coating of an opaque paint, such coating would preferably not extend so far in front of the LED <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> that it blocks the transmission of light from lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> through mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> into viewing angle C (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Alternatively, such a coating of paint could extend completely in front of LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, provided it is configured to have some form of louver or equivalent structure formed in its surface in the window <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> area, which is in the intended transmission path of LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. For example, the thickness of such a paint coating could be controlled to create effective louvers using screen-printing, molding, stamping, or laser ablation. Further, if reflector/electrode <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is configured in the manner described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, element <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> can be a coating of black paint with similar bars or stripes in the areas overlying LED <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, being oriented relative to LED <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and reflective strips <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> of reflector/electrode <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, so as to provide a transmission path at the appropriate angle for vehicle B to view the lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> emissions when in viewing angle C, while at the same time blocking light from reaching the field of view of the driver of vehicle A. Further, the bars <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> of reflector/electrode <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> may be configured to have varying minimum widths, such that the minimum width decreases with increasing distance from the driver, so as to reduce peripheral transmittance through window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> in the direction of the driver, or may have a less pronounced edge coloration definition, as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> If element <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> is a mirror heating element, that heating element will be provided in place of the separate heater <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime; described previously. By removing the heater <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime; and the circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, a significant amount of weight can be removed from the mirror, which is helpful in reducing the total weight of the mirror. If heating element <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> is used, the heating element <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> can be provided on an adhesive material such as two-sided tape, and mounted extending across the entire fourth surface of the mirror except for the window <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> regions. The window regions can be provided by apertures cut at appropriate locations to pass light emitted from LED <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and transmitted at the appropriate angle to be visible within viewing angle C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an alternative electrochromic mirror, having a fourth surface reflector <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. In this arrangement, the electrode <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> on the third surface is preferably made of a transparent material similar to that of electrode <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and deposited on an optional color suppression material <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, which is similar to color suppression material <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The layer <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> is a protective paint well known in the art, which is deposited on the reflector coating <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, which, in turn, is deposited on the fourth surface of the mirror. The reflector layer can be aluminum nickel, chrome, rhodium, stainless steel, silver, silver alloy, platinum, palladium, gold, or combinations thereof. The window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> in reflector <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is aligned with the peak intensity optical axis of the emitter <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and lens <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> such that the peak intensity optical axis passes through the center of the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows interleaved openings <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, but it should be understood that the window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> may be completely devoid of reflective material or may have a transflective or dichroic coating in accordance with the teachings herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates a mirror having a transparent element <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> and a reflector coating <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>. Although the reflector coating is illustrated on the back surface of the transparent element, the coating can be on the front surface. The transparent element <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> can be the second element of a two-element mirror, such as an electrochromic mirror, or it can be the only transparent element of a standard single element mirror. It will be recognized that in the case of an electrochromic mirror, the illustrated reflective coating is applied to the fourth surface, whereas in the case of a single element mirror, the illustrated reflective coating is applied to the second surface of the mirror. The reflective coating <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> includes an opening <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> through which light generated by lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> passes to provide a signal indication. In either case, it is envisioned that the opening <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> will have a maximum transmittance and no reflectance, such that the light produced by lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> will pass substantially unattenuated through the reflective layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates a mirror having a dichroic layer <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> disposed on a surface of transparent element <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. Although the reflector coating is illustrated on the back surface of the transparent element, the coating can be on the front surface. The dichroic layer <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> passes light within a predetermined pass band and attenuates light outside of that pass band. The advantage of using a dichroic layer <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> in a signal mirror is that red is the preferred lamp color for signal mirrors and commercially viable dichroic layers pass only red and infrared light. There are several disadvantages to dichroic materials, not least of which is that they are expensive, difficult to manufacture, and subject to degradation over time. An opaque coating <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>, having window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> therein, is provided in the mirror on the back surface of the mirror. The opaque coating may a paint coating, such as a black paint, and provides a baffle to block direct light emitted in the direction of the driver, which light if not blocked could be objectionable to the driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the mirror subassembly <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is shown in an exploded view. It is envisioned that the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, which is illustrated to be an electrochromic mirror, but can be a dichroic or non-electrochromic mirror, will be assembled such that front transparent element <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and rear transparent element <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> are held in a spaced-apart relationship such that the electrochromic medium is disposed there between. To assemble the other components of the mirror subassembly, an adhesive, and preferably an adhesive tape or film, or a double-sided foam adhesive tape, is provided between the circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the carrier plate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and attached over the circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. A recess <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> in the carrier plate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is aligned with lamp module <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> to receive the lamp module upon adhesion of the circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to the carrier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, as noted above, is an optional element and can be omitted. In the event that the circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is omitted, the mirror including the heater <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>&prime; is attached to the carrier plate <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> using an adhesive, adhesive tape or film, or double-sided foam adhesive tape. The bezel <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> can be potted to the rear of carrier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, or the bezel and rear of carrier <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be snap connected, attached by fasteners such as screws or clips, heat staked, or attached by other suitable conventional means. Once assembled, the mirror assembly <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is assembled into the mirror body housing <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> by attachment to motor <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is controlled either from the controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> or directly from the turn signal in the vehicle&apos;s electrical system. A circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> for energizing the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The circuit is mounted on circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> or circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> includes an input <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> for connection to controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> or the turn signal wire in the vehicle electrical system. The capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> provides a path to ground for high frequency energy, such as power spikes, to protect the circuit. Diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reverse biased to isolate input <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> if the voltage on input <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> drops below the voltage on terminal <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>. The NPN transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the associated resistors effect a cascode current source for the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> includes two emitters <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>&prime; having a common cathode connection at lead <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, and anode leads <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> connected via respective resistors to terminal <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>. Although two emitters are disclosed, a single emitter, or more than two emitters, could be included in the LED lamp. The cascode current source generates a substantially constant current at the collector of transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, approximately half of which will flow through each of the emitters <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>&prime;. Additionally, the circuit provides additional protection against excessive current. In particular, if the collector current of transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is high enough for transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to saturate, the resulting low collector voltage on transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will turn transistors Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> OFF, thus cutting off current through the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> emitters <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>&prime;. Although the circuit is disclosed including NPN transistors, it will be recognized that other transistor elements can be used, such as PNP, MOSFET or combinations of different transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Circuit <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is an alternative to circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>. Circuit <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> differs from circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> in that the emitters <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>&prime; of LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; are connected in series. The anode lead <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> of emitter <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> is connected to terminal <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> through resistor R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the cathode lead <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> of emitter <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight> is connected to the collector of transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The heat extraction member collector <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, connected to the cathode of emitter <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> and the anode of emitter <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight>, is connected to the junction terminal of the optional resistors <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight>, which terminal floats. The series connection of the LED emitters <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight> in LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) is advantageous as it uses less power than the common cathode, or parallel, arrangement of emitters <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>&prime; in LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). For example, circuit <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> operates at 1.75 Watts, for a flashing signal having a 75 percent duty cycle and a period of less than one second, whereas circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> operates at 3.9 Watts with the same signal input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The series emitter LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; can include optional resistors <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight>, each connected in parallel with a respective one of the emitters <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight>. The resistors <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight> are used to reduce the current through one, or both, of the emitters <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight> of LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; if it is necessary for the current through the emitters to be different, although only one of the resistors could be used to reduce the current through only one of the emitters. An example where it would be desirable to have different currents is an application where the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; is to produce white light from complementary colored emitters. In such a case, the ratio of the current through the emitters may need to be different to accommodate different operating characteristics of each of the emitters and achieve the desired LED white light. The resistors <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight> can be manufactured by thick film deposits on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, discrete resistors attached to the heat sink, or circuit board <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> if used, which are laser etched to achieve the desired resistance. Additionally, it is envisioned that instead of resistors <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight>, a controlled current source or current sink can be connected to lead <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> to control the relative current through each of the emitters, and thus adjust the color and/or intensity of the light generated by the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In operation, when the driver moves the turn signal actuator <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) on the steering wheel column, an intermittent signal appears at the input <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, which signal is either produced by the controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> or by the vehicle in a conventional manner. Responsive to the pulses on input <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> controls the current through the emitters of LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime;. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; emits light during the pulses ON period and do not emit light when the pulse is OFF. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; is thus synchronized to the vehicle&apos;s turn signal, producing a flashing signal having the same duty cycle as the vehicle&apos;s primary turn signal lamps. It is envisioned that the controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can control the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; to repeat the brake light responsive to the brake light signal. Additionally, protection against excessive current is provided by the transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In particular, whenever the base current input to transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is sufficiently high to cause transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to saturate, the resulting small collector current on transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will turn transistors Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> off, which turns the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; OFF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a signal mirror is disclosed herein that can be advantageously employed with a number of different mirror arrangements. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any other electrochromic, dichroic, non-dichroic, single element, or multiple element mirror, whether convex, aspheric, or flat, may be advantageously employed with the high-powered LED signal lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to implement a signal mirror which is highly effective, small in size, and of light weight, such that a signal mirror may be designed into virtually any mirror housing with minimal impact on the mirror&apos;s principle function of providing a reflector. A number of different embodiments of the lamp module <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> will now be described, which may be used with any of the mirrors described above, to implement a signal mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> A first alternate lamp module <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> is disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. Lamp module <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> includes an LED lamp <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight>, substantially similar to the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> in module <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, except that leads <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> are bent to provide a planar mounting surface at the ends thereof. The surface ends are mounted on rectangular printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1605</bold></highlight> using any suitable conventional technique, such as wave soldering, hand soldering, or the like. The circuit board is of any suitable conventional construction, and can advantageously be a two-sided circuit board such that the LED lamp is electrically connected to a conductor layer on one side of the circuit board substrate, and circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> is mounted to a conductor layer on the other side of the circuit board substrate. Both conductor layers have conductors etched therein, and it is further envisioned that the traces can be connected by vias (not shown). The LED lamp <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> is secured to beat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> by any suitable conventional means such as fastener <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, an adhesive, an adhesive tape, or the like. A significant advantage to the surface mount module <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> is that surface mounting an IC is a less costly and more efficient manufacturing technique for achieving a reliable electrical connection. However, where the depth of the lamp module <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> is a concern, lamp module <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) can be used as it has a lower height, but longer, with the LED lamp leads <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> extending transversely to the circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Another alternate lamp module <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight> is disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. Lamp module <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to lamp module <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, differing in two respects. A first distinction is that the circuit board <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> is illustrated to be a rectangular circuit board, as opposed to a triangular circuit board <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. It will be recognized that the circuit boards <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1605</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> described herein can be of any shape, and thus the shapes presented are merely illustrative. It is envisioned that the shape of the circuit board will be dictated by the housing in which it is mounted, and further that the shape and size of the circuit board will be selected to accommodate the electrical components of circuits <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> in the smallest possible volume where volume is critical. The board can be large in those components and assemblies where a large volume is available. A second distinction is that the heat sink <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> extends across the entire bottom surface of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, whereas the heat sink of lamp module <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> extends only along the tab of the heat extraction member. The partial heat sink <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is necessary when the heat sink is mounted on the lens side of the LED. Because heat sink <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> extends the entire length of the LED lamp, the large surface area provided by fins <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> (only some of which are numbered) provides a substantial heat dissipation path for the one or more emitters <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Another alternate LED lamp module <highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight> is disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Lamp module <highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight> includes the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The LED lamp module <highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight> differs from module <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> in that the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is plugged into connector <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> includes contacts <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight>, which electrically connect to, and mechanically engage, the distal ends <highlight><bold>1808</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1810</bold></highlight> of leads <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. The contacts <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight> are connected to a circuit <highlight><bold>1812</bold></highlight>, having circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> thereon, which is connected to wires <highlight><bold>1813</bold></highlight> of the vehicle wire harness. Additionally, the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is mounted to an active heat sink <highlight><bold>1820</bold></highlight>, which is illustrated to be a Peltier cooler. The Peltier cooler can be provided by any suitable commercially available Peltier cooler. The Peltier cooler has a hot surface <highlight><bold>1822</bold></highlight> and cold surface <highlight><bold>1824</bold></highlight>. The cold surface <highlight><bold>1824</bold></highlight> is positioned in abutting relation with the heat extraction member <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The hot surface of the Peltier cooler is positioned away from the LED lamp. The Peltier cooler will preferably be connected to a passive heat sink (not shown), such as passive heat sink <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight>, to provide adequate heat dissipation and to insure most effective operation of the cooler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> For maximal reliability and manufacturing/assembly flexibility, the high-power LED lamp may be constructed to optimize its compatibility with solder-less connection mechanisms such as connectors, sockets, headers and other receptacles. The ends of the leads of the high-power LED lamp, in this circumstance, are fabricated with the dimensions of a male pin intended to mate with the female socket of the receptacle. Suitable female sockets are available from such companies as Amp, Molex, Autosplice, and other connector manufacturers, in a wide variety of forms including versions which are pre-soldered to a printed circuit board and others which crimp onto the wires of the wiring harness. An example of a two lead LED lamp connection to a conventional Autosplice receptacle is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> is similar to LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, but includes only two leads <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1903</bold></highlight>. Standoffs <highlight><bold>1906</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1908</bold></highlight> of the leads <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1903</bold></highlight> provide a stop to limit the depth of the lead insertion. The plastic connector <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight> includes metal contacts <highlight><bold>1922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1923</bold></highlight> that terminate in crimps <highlight><bold>1926</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1927</bold></highlight>, respectively. When the pins <highlight><bold>1902</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1904</bold></highlight> of the leads <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1903</bold></highlight> are inserted into the socket, the contacts bite into the ends of the leads to securely hold the leads <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1903</bold></highlight> in connector <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight> in a manner that prevents ready disengagement from the socket due to mechanical vibrations, stress, or the like. The wires <highlight><bold>1930</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1931</bold></highlight> are part of the vehicle wire harness, held in socket by crimps <highlight><bold>1926</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1928</bold></highlight>. The wires <highlight><bold>1930</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1931</bold></highlight> and the contacts <highlight><bold>1922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1923</bold></highlight> electrically connect the leads <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1903</bold></highlight> of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight>, to the electrical circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The lamp <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> may simply be plugged into the chosen receptacle, obviating the traditional soldering operation usually needed to connect electrical components to a printed circuit board. This can be very useful in applications where soldering is impractical (such as in simple circuits where no printed circuit board is used) or in commercial enterprises where appropriate automated insertion equipment, such as surface, radial or axial mount equipment is not available. In one such configuration, by way of example, the narrow portion of the pins <highlight><bold>1902</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1904</bold></highlight> of the leads <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1903</bold></highlight> below the standoff <highlight><bold>1906</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1908</bold></highlight> are fabricated to have a 0.51 mm by 0.51 mm square cross-section for insertion into a standard receptacle from Autosplice, which require this size pin. Another advantage of this configuration in some applications is the dimensional tolerance afforded by this connection method. In a map light or CHMSL, for example, it would be typical for the high-power emitter to acquire its directional alignment and dimensional registration through intimate contact with portions of an assembly such as a housing or the support member. This can usually be established with snap connector features, bosses, flanges or other structures integrated with the housing or support member. This housing, with integrated registration features, may be molded by thermoplastic injection molding, for example, but manufacturing variations and environmental thermal expansion/contraction may alter the nominal dimensions and orientation of the supporting alignment and registration means, resulting in dislocation of the power semiconductor mounted thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Such dislocations might be acceptable in and of themselves, as it is common to design systems that are tolerant of such minor deviations. However, these can present a problem in the most extreme cases, as any such dislocations may be transmitted to the connection point at the leads of the power semiconductor emitter. If this electrical connection is extremely rigid and brittle, as is sometimes the case with solder joints at a PCB, then the electrical connections may ultimately become marginal, or intermittent in response to the dislocations. Due to their inherent flexibility, a pin and socket configuration can avoid this problem in a fashion uniquely applicable to the LED lamp components and assemblies disclosed herein. Due to the unusually high flux emitted by these LED lamps, one or two components may now be used where an array of several LEDs was previously required. Since the number of electrical connections is radically diminished as compared to systems using prior art LED lamps, it is not necessary in every application to utilize mass connection techniques such as soldering to a printed circuit board (PCB). Due to the low connection count, it becomes feasible to use socket connections, where soldered connections were the only practical solution previously. Thus, in some of the embodiments, the LED lamp is disclosed having leads, which can be adapted for use with socket connectors to gain the uniquely applicable interconnect benefits associated with the high-power emissions of the LED lamps advantageously used herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Another signal mirror <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>) includes a thin transparent element <highlight><bold>2008</bold></highlight> bonded to a circuit board <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> cut from commercially available printed circuit board stock. The transparent element <highlight><bold>2008</bold></highlight> may be the only transparent element of a single element mirror, or the second transparent element of an electrochromic mirror. The thin transparent element <highlight><bold>2008</bold></highlight> is adhered to layer <highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>, which is a layer of electrically conductive material, and is preferably etched to include a heater element for the mirror. The middle layer <highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight> of the circuit board is formed of a substrate material, having good electrical insulation properties, as is well known in the art. The top layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight> of the circuit board is another electrically conductive layer. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20, a</cross-reference> hole <highlight><bold>2012</bold></highlight> is formed in the circuit board <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> to receive the lens <highlight><bold>2015</bold></highlight> of LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight> and provide a light path through the printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight> is preferably surface mounted to the printed circuit board top layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>, with the heat extraction member oriented in parallel with the surface of that layer and the mirror. A deviator element <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> may be positioned between the lens of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight> and the transparent layer <highlight><bold>2008</bold></highlight> to redirect the light emitted by LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight> at a non-orthogonal angle, such as the approximately 20-50&deg; angle described above. The deviator element <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> can be provided using a suitable commercially available means such as a deviator film, a light control film such as that commercially available from 3M, a holographic optical element, a holographic diffuser, a diffractive grating, a Fresnel lens, or the like. Each of these elements can be used with the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight> mounted in parallel with the rear surface of the mirror and direct light in a desired direction. A reflector <highlight><bold>2017</bold></highlight> is positioned in the hole <highlight><bold>2012</bold></highlight> to increase the intensity of light emitted through element <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The signal mirror <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> takes advantage of properties of printed circuit board stock to implement a thin mirror. The chip manufacturing industry has developed technologies for providing PC boards and computer disks (CDs) that are characteristically very flat, which is highly desirable for a mirror carrier. A thin mirror using a circuit board as a carrier is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/270,153, entitled &ldquo;LIGHT WEIGHT ELECTROCHROMIC MIRROR,&rdquo; filed on Mar. 16, 1999, by John K. Roberts et al., now U.S. Pat. No. 6,195,194, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The flatness specifications for PC boards are widely available in the industry and can be obtained from any of the manufacturers. The flatness will vary depending on the thickness and grade/quality of the purchased PC board. The PC board is selected according to the desired stiffness and weight considerations for the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The specifications for printed circuit boards are such that each conductor layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight> must provide electrical continuity over its entire surface area. A circuit connecting LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight> with other circuitry can thus be etched in the top layer <highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight> of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the circuits can be cut using a subtractive process, where electrically conductive material is removed from the conductive layer using, for example, chemical or laser etching. Alternatively, the circuit layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight> can be added to the non-conductive substrate layer <highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight> using an additive process wherein electrically conductive material is coated on the nonconductive substrate <highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the conductor layer <highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight> can be etched to provide the heater element traces, or the conductive strips can be added by coating the substrate layer <highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The signal mirror <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> takes advantage of the circuit board conductor layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>, which can be a copper layer, for example, to provide a heat sink for the heat extraction member <highlight><bold>2018</bold></highlight> of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the heat extraction member is positioned against an optional spacer <highlight><bold>2020</bold></highlight>, which spacer must be thermally conductive. The spacer is provided to insure a thermal coupling over much of the surface area of the heat extraction member that overlaps with the conductor layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>, and the spacer may be any suitable material having a low thermal resistance, and may be a metal spacer, an adhesive, or any other suitable material. The heat extraction member <highlight><bold>2018</bold></highlight> is bonded to the spacer (if the spacer is provided by other than an adhesive or adhesive tape), which in turn is bonded to the conductor layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>. By attaching the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight> using a thermally conductive adhesive and spacer <highlight><bold>2020</bold></highlight>, the thermal coupling to layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight> provides an additional, large heat dissipation surface for the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The circuit board <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> can include conductor traces to which the electrical leads of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight> can be attached, an additional heat sink to which the heat extraction member <highlight><bold>2018</bold></highlight>, and conductive traces in layer <highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight> can provide the heater for clearing the mirror surface of moisture. This circuit board <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> can also be used for the carrier for the mirror, and because the circuit board structure provides a strong, flat surface, the transparent element can be very thin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows a signal mirror <highlight><bold>2101</bold></highlight> substantially similar to signal mirror <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>, wherein an LED lamp <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> is mounted on the back of a circuit board <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> differs from the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight> in that the lens <highlight><bold>2115</bold></highlight> of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> is offset relative to the emitter <highlight><bold>2013</bold></highlight>, whereas the emitter <highlight><bold>2013</bold></highlight> is aligned with the center of the lens <highlight><bold>2015</bold></highlight> in LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight>. Because of the lens offset, the peak intensity optical axis of the lamp <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> is directed at an angle &bgr; with respect to the front surface of the transparent element, whereas the peak intensity optical axis <highlight><bold>2030</bold></highlight> of LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight> is directed orthogonal to the transparent element <highlight><bold>2008</bold></highlight>. Additionally, an opaque coating <highlight><bold>2110</bold></highlight> can be applied to a portion of the window region of the mirror to provide a light baffle blocking the transmission of direct light from the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> toward the driver. The angle &bgr; can be 0&deg; to 70&deg;, and may advantageously be 20&deg; to 50&deg; and most preferably is between 30&deg; to 40&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In either signal mirror <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>2101</bold></highlight>, although not shown, it will be recognized that the circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> can be mounted on the conductor layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight>, and electrically connected by conductors (not shown) etched in layer <highlight><bold>2002</bold></highlight> to LED lamp <highlight><bold>2016</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight>. Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the offset lens <highlight><bold>2115</bold></highlight> of LED lamp <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> may be used in combination with the deviator element <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> An alternative signal mirror <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> including a bezel mounted LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The signal mirror <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> includes a bezel <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight>, a mirror <highlight><bold>2204</bold></highlight>, and a carrier <highlight><bold>2206</bold></highlight>. The mirror <highlight><bold>2200</bold></highlight> can be any type of mirror, including electrochromic, dichroic, single element, multiple element, flat, convex, and/or aspheric. The carrier is of any suitable construction, such as molded of an organic polymer, stamped from a metal, or the like. The bezel may be molded from an organic polymer, stamped from metal, or of any other suitable known manufacture, and the bezel and carrier may be of the same or different material. The bezel includes an aperture <highlight><bold>2208</bold></highlight>, which is illustrated located in the lower left corner of the mirror, but may alternately be positioned at any location on the bezel, such as the bottom center, bottom left corner, top left corner, top center, top right corner, or any location therebetween. A lens <highlight><bold>2210</bold></highlight>, which can be clear or colored, and of any suitable construction such as molded from an organic polymer is disposed within aperture <highlight><bold>2208</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that the lens will be molded of a red transparent plastic, such as an acrylic or a polycarbonate, and that a red-orange LED lamp will be mounted so as to direct light outwardly therethrough. The lens <highlight><bold>2210</bold></highlight> is attached to the opening <highlight><bold>2208</bold></highlight> in bezel <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight> using a fastener, an adhesive, an adhesive tape, or the like. It will be recognized that the lens will be a filter if it is colored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The lamp module <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> positioned behind the lens includes an LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, with the leads bent at a right angle for insertion into openings <highlight><bold>2225</bold></highlight> in a circuit board <highlight><bold>2222</bold></highlight>. The heat extraction member <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is mounted to a passive heat sink <highlight><bold>2224</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the LED lamp module <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> is mounted adjacent to mirror <highlight><bold>2204</bold></highlight> in a void thereof. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> can be mounted in parallel with the lens, with a deviator element, such as deviator <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight>, positioned between the lamp and the lens, or the lens can be a Fresnel lens, which directs light away from the driver and into viewing area C. The LED lamp module <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> is very compact, is resistant to damage from vibrations, and can be mounted in the bezel, but generates enough light to produce a signal of sufficient intensity to be readily visible in both daylight and nighttime ambient light conditions. The module <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> can be attached to carrier <highlight><bold>2206</bold></highlight> in region <highlight><bold>2240</bold></highlight> using an adhesive, a fastener such as tape or snap connector, or the like. The snap connector can be integrally molded in the bezel, and extend outwardly therefrom. The snap connector will snap over the lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to hold the module <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> on the bezel. Alternatively, the region <highlight><bold>2240</bold></highlight> can include an integrally molded socket, and in particular a recess shaped to receive the lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and heat sink <highlight><bold>2224</bold></highlight>, and including female connectors to mate with the leads <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, such that the circuit board <highlight><bold>2222</bold></highlight> can be omitted. The heat sink <highlight><bold>2224</bold></highlight> can be active or passive. Additionally, the bezel mounted LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> can take advantage of the air flowing around the perimeter of the mirror to increase heat dissipation. This can, for example, be accomplished by positioning the heat extraction member <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and/or heat sink <highlight><bold>2224</bold></highlight> in juxtaposition with the periphery edge <highlight><bold>2232</bold></highlight> of the bezel, which effect can be enhanced by making the bezel region adjacent the heat sink such that it has a low thermal conductivity. The low thermal conductivity can be achieved by having thermally conductive material embedded in the bezel <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight> adjacent the heat sink. The LED lamp module, including a heat extraction member coupled to a heat sink, thus provides a small lamp that will fit into a bezel, and capable of producing a bright light, and doing so in a package that can be expected to have a long life even when subject to the thermal and mechanical shocks of the type experienced in door mounted mirrors, and more particularly, around the perimeter of such a mirror. </paragraph>

Unlike the bezel mounting arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, wherein the lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is mounted within the bezel to provide light directly, which may in some circumstances reduce the size of the reflective surface of the mirror, the signal mirror <highlight><bold>2300</bold></highlight> has an LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> positioned behind the mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and uses a light pipe <highlight><bold>2302</bold></highlight> to emit the light through a surface <highlight><bold>2304</bold></highlight> of bezel <highlight><bold>2301</bold></highlight> on the front of the mirror. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> inputs light at one end of a light pipe <highlight><bold>2302</bold></highlight>, which focuses the light on an end <highlight><bold>2304</bold></highlight> visible from viewing area C. In this arrangement, the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> illuminates the bezel itself and the bezel can be very small as it need not accommodate the lamp in the perimeter thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The light pipe <highlight><bold>2302</bold></highlight> may be of any suitable construction, such as molded from an acrylic, a polycarbonate, or the like.

The high power LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is mounted to an end of the light pipe with the lens <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> directed into the light pipe. The heat sink <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> is mounted to the back of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> electrical leads can be plugged into a connector <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>) or a receptacle <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>), which are coupled to a circuit such as circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight>. Such a circuit may be mounted on a circuit board that is preferably mounted internally of the connector/socket. Alternatively, the socket/connector may be coupled to an external circuit board. The mirror <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> may be aspheric, convex, flat, electrochromic, dichroic, single element reflector, or the like, and the light pipe <highlight><bold>2302</bold></highlight>, like the bezel lamp <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, is compatible with any type of mirror commonly used with vehicles. </paragraph>

The keyhole illuminator includes a high power LED lamp <highlight><bold>2606</bold></highlight> that produces light to illuminate the door handle <highlight><bold>2702</bold></highlight> and the keyhole <highlight><bold>2704</bold></highlight>, or alternatively produces light directed toward the ground to effect a puddle lamp. The keyhole illuminator <highlight><bold>2602</bold></highlight> includes high power LED lamp <highlight><bold>2606</bold></highlight> positioned behind a window <highlight><bold>2610</bold></highlight>. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2606</bold></highlight> may include one or multiple emitters (not shown) under an encapsulant lens. The LED lamp preferably produces white light, and thus includes one or more phosphor emitters, binary complementary colored emitters, or red-green-blue emitters, which are energized so as to produce white light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, the lens of LED <highlight><bold>2608</bold></highlight> of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2604</bold></highlight> is preferably of a relatively small diameter to produce a focused light that can be targeted on an area to be illuminated. Alternatively, if the lamp is used to produce puddle light illumination, the lens will have a larger diameter producing a significantly less focused light. The keyhole illuminator may turn ON responsive to a proximity detector, a remote keyless entry, manual actuation of the door handle, turning the vehicle off, or the like, and it can turn OFF automatically after a predetermined time period has elapsed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The mirror body housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight> is molded from a clear polycarbonate, or other suitable transparent material. The inside surface of the mirror has a coating <highlight><bold>2931</bold></highlight>, which is, for example, an opaque paint that matches the exterior color of vehicle A. Those skilled in the art will recognize that this is a significantly different approach than commonly used to manufacture housings for vehicles. Typically, a housing is painted on the exterior surface to match the vehicle body color. After the paint has dried, a clear coat is applied. A significant advantage to painting the interior surface of the mirror body housing is that paint chipping or scratching will not occur when the paint is on the interior surface. The prior art is subject to chipping or scratching when flying debris strikes the surface at high velocity. Although such an occurrence may result in some minor surface damage to the mirror body housing, the surface damage can be smoothed out. An additional advantage where the mirror includes lamps to project light through the housing, windows, such as windows <highlight><bold>2930</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2932</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2934</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2936</bold></highlight> need only be provided in the paint coating. For example, the windows can be formed by applying masking tape to the window regions <highlight><bold>2930</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2932</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2934</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2936</bold></highlight> prior to applying the paint coating to the inside surface of the mirror housing, and after applying the paint, removing the tape leaving the window opening. The LED lamps <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2924</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2926</bold></highlight> can then be supported on the mirror body housing adjacent the window, which will transmit light out through the transparent body housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The mirror body housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight> can advantageously be formed including one, or more, integral lens structures. For example, lenses <highlight><bold>2933</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2935</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2937</bold></highlight> can be formed integrally with the transparent housing during molding of the housing, in the locations where it is desired to mount LED lamps, or alternatively, the lenses can be cut into the mirror body housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight> using a conventional means, such as laser etching after the housing is formed. The lenses will be described in greater detail herein below with respect to the lamps with which they are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> An LED lamp <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight> is mounted adjacent the inside surface of mirror housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight> at window <highlight><bold>2930</bold></highlight>, which is aligned with lens <highlight><bold>2933</bold></highlight>. An LED lamp <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> is mounted in the mirror housing body <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight> adjacent window <highlight><bold>2932</bold></highlight>, which is aligned with lens <highlight><bold>2935</bold></highlight>. The LED lamps <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> are preferably attached to the inside mirror housing using respective mounting brackets or sockets <highlight><bold>2940</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2944</bold></highlight>. Each of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> can be implemented using a respective lamp module <highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight>, without the Peltier cooler <highlight><bold>1820</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). Accordingly, each of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> includes a heat extraction member <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (not shown) mounted directly against back wall <highlight><bold>2942</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2945</bold></highlight> of bracket/socket <highlight><bold>2940</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2944</bold></highlight>, respectively. Additionally, each of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> is connected to a respective connector <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). The respective conductors <highlight><bold>1813</bold></highlight> for each of the sockets <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> associated with each of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> are connected either to the controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) or directly to the turn signal control for the vehicle. The circuit <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> for each of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> is mounted in its respective connector <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>. The LED lamps <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> are all thus connected to receive a common control signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In operation, the LED lamps <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> provide a turn signal repeater. The peak intensity optical axes of the three signal lamps are intentionally at substantially different angles. Substantial angles are at least 5&deg; apart. By providing such a distribution of light, the light source has a higher visibility over a wider viewing angle than can be achieved by a single lamp. Additionally, by spacing the lamps and orienting them at different angles, in combination with using the LED having high power capabilities, from a distance the LEDs will appear to be a single light. The diffusing lenses <highlight><bold>2933</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2935</bold></highlight> increase the viewing angle, and because the LED lamps <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> produce very bright light, this light will be visible even in low ambient light conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> More particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shows an iso-candela plot for the LED lamps <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> relative to a vehicle A. As can be seen therein, the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> produces light intensity distribution <highlight><bold>2960</bold></highlight> around peak intensity optical axis <highlight><bold>2916</bold></highlight>, which is readily visible within viewing angle C. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight> produces light that is dispersed by lens <highlight><bold>2933</bold></highlight> resulting in a broader intensity distribution <highlight><bold>2961</bold></highlight> around peak intensity optical axis <highlight><bold>2917</bold></highlight>. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> similarly produces light that is dispersed by lens <highlight><bold>2935</bold></highlight> resulting in a light intensity distribution <highlight><bold>2962</bold></highlight> around peak intensity optical axis <highlight><bold>2918</bold></highlight>. In these iso-candela plots, the line <highlight><bold>2960</bold></highlight> represents points at which the intensity of light emitted by LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are equal. Similarly, the line <highlight><bold>2961</bold></highlight> represents points at which the intensity of light emitted by LED lamp <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight> is equal. The line <highlight><bold>2962</bold></highlight> represents points at which the intensity of the light emitted by LED lamp <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> is equal. It will be recognized that the iso-candela plot for the combined LED lamps would be different as the light from the lamps would be added. Nevertheless, as can be seen from the distribution, LED lamps <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> produce a light distribution that is visible from 180&deg; around the mirror. This distribution can be achieved without LED lamp <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> using slightly different optics or moving the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> toward the back of the mirror body housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight>. Additionally, if desired, the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> can be a low power LED lamp or an array of LED lamps that emit light through a plurality of openings or a dichroic mirror. Additionally, more than two LEDs can be used on the mirror housing body. However, the high power LED having a heat extraction member disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,548 enables a single LED on the mirror body housing to be used with a lamp in the mirror to provide a signal repeater visible from a wide angle array, meeting the legal requirements for signal repeaters in countries requiring a wide viewing angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2924</bold></highlight> is mounted on the front of the mirror body housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight>, and faces forwardly of the vehicle to produce high power infrared (IR) light for a communication system or a camera system. The lamp is positioned to emit light through the front window <highlight><bold>2934</bold></highlight> of mirror housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight>. The IR LED lamp <highlight><bold>2924</bold></highlight> can produce IR light usable by an onboard camera during low ambient light conditions, and the strong IR emissions will increase the range of the camera. Another advantageous use is in IR transceiver applications such as IR communication systems, wherein the intensity of the IR radiation will directly impact communication signal quality, and thus the reliability of the communication link. An exemplary vehicle application using the high power LED where reliable communication signal quality is important is the drive-through tollbooth wherein a toll payment is made without stopping. Using a high power LED lamp increases the range of the IR link and makes communication more reliable, increasing the amount of time that the vehicle can be in communication with the toll collecting equipment and significantly decreasing the chances that toll collection does not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2926</bold></highlight> is mounted flush on window <highlight><bold>2936</bold></highlight> in the bottom surface of the mirror body housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight>. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2926</bold></highlight> is a puddle lamp producing light directed downwardly to illuminate an area below the mirror, and preferably adjacent the door of vehicle A. This LED lamp is preferably a high power, white light LED, and most advantageously an LED lamp having a heat extraction member positioned against a heat sink <highlight><bold>2950</bold></highlight>. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2926</bold></highlight> abuts with the inside surface of housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight> aligned with the lens <highlight><bold>2937</bold></highlight>. The lens <highlight><bold>2937</bold></highlight> is a large radius lens producing a wide illumination area. The LED may be mounted to the inside surface of the mirror housing body using a transparent adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Each of the lamps <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2924</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2926</bold></highlight> is mounted to a bracket <highlight><bold>2940</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2944</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2946</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2948</bold></highlight> that is in turn mounted to the inside of mirror body housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight>. The mounting bracket or sockets <highlight><bold>2940</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2944</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2946</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2948</bold></highlight> are attached to the inside surface of the mirror housing body using an adhesive, mechanical fastener such as a snap connector integrally molded with the mounting bracket or the mirror body housing <highlight><bold>2915</bold></highlight>, or the like. The mounting bracket can be molded from an organic polymer, stamped from a metal or metal alloy, or manufactured by any other suitable means. In the illustrated embodiment, the back walls <highlight><bold>2942</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2945</bold></highlight> are thermally conductive, but not electrically conductive. It is envisioned that where the brackets are molded from a dielectric material, a thermally conductive material can be interspersed in the nonconductive material so as to provide a thermal path therethrough. For example, the plastic bracket can be impregnated with metal fragments, such as pieces of copper. The bracket, or socket, <highlight><bold>2948</bold></highlight> can include a hole through which a heat sink <highlight><bold>2950</bold></highlight> protrudes. The heat sink is preferably implemented using a heat sink <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The bracket/sockets <highlight><bold>2940</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2944</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2946</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2948</bold></highlight> provide an enclosure that seals the LED modules against moisture, dirt, and the like. Additionally, the bracket/sockets can be opaque to prevent ambient light from passing from the inside surface through the windows <highlight><bold>2930</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2932</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2934</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2936</bold></highlight> such that it is visible from the exterior of the mirror. The bracket/sockets are mounted to the interior surface of the mirror housing using an adhesive, adhesive tape, a fastener, or any other suitable means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In operation, the LED lamps <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2922</bold></highlight> for a turn signal repeater that reproduce a flashing light in signal with the primary turn signal on the vehicle. The turn signal repeater can optionally be illuminated with a steady light to repeat a brake light on the vehicle if desired. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2924</bold></highlight> can be connected to an IR communication system associated with vehicle A to provide a high power IR transmitter. The heat extraction member and the heat sink enable the IR transmitter to produce a very strong communication signal. Finally, the puddle light in the housing can be used in place of, or in addition to the puddle LED lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The puddle lamp thus turns ON responsive to a proximity detector, a remote keyless entry signal, manual actuation of the door handle, turning the vehicle off, or the like, and it can turn OFF automatically after a predetermined time period has elapsed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> An interior signal mirror <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> is disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</cross-reference>. The interior signal mirror <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> is of the type producing compass heading information in window <highlight><bold>3002</bold></highlight> of an electrochromic mirror <highlight><bold>3004</bold></highlight>. For example, the display <highlight><bold>3002</bold></highlight> may generate signals indicating whether the vehicle is heading N, S, E or W, or combinations thereof such as the illustrated NE, which is northeast. The electrochromic mirror can be implemented using any suitable electrochromic mirror. The images on display <highlight><bold>3002</bold></highlight> may be generated by a backlit liquid crystal display (LCD) <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>), which is, for example, a reverse mode addressable LCD. The LCD is controlled to generate images by acting as a shutter to selectively block the passage of light therethrough. The backlighting is thus used to project a bright light in those areas where the LCD does not attenuate light. The LCD operates in this manner to generate graphic images, alphanumeric images, and even pictorial or video images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The LCD is mounted to the back surface of the electrochromic mirror element <highlight><bold>3004</bold></highlight> using a transparent optical coupling medium <highlight><bold>3102</bold></highlight>. In particular, the optical coupling medium is a clear pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA), such as that commercially available adhesive number <highlight><bold>4910</bold></highlight> from 3M, ultraviolet (UV) cure silicone or epoxy, or thermoplastic PVB laminate having a refractive index of approximately 1.5, which is substantially matched to the refractive index of the third surface transparent member <highlight><bold>3004</bold></highlight>. A transmissive diffuser <highlight><bold>3106</bold></highlight> is optionally mounted behind the LCD to diffuse the light produced by high power LED lamp <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight>. This permits positioning of the LED lamp <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> close to the LCD panel <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight>, which is necessary where the mirror <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> does not have much depth behind the LCD panel <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight>. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>2220</bold></highlight> can have a lens <highlight><bold>3110</bold></highlight> with a large radius. Alternatively, a flat lens LED lamp <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>), which will produce scattered light due to the wide beam resulting from flat surface <highlight><bold>3201</bold></highlight>, can be used to illuminate the LCD. As mentioned above, it is envisioned that the lens will have a very large diameter, such that the lens provides some focusing of the radiation emitted thereby, but still disperses the light over the entire area of the LCD panel <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight>. Combining such relatively unfocused light with a mild diffuser <highlight><bold>3106</bold></highlight> will insure that the entire area of the LCD panel is illuminated and that the image produced will be bright and easily viewable even through an electrochromic mirror including a transflective window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The mirror <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> can advantageously include map lamps <highlight><bold>3012</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3014</bold></highlight> located on the bottom of the mirror to illuminate the front seat of the vehicle A. The map lamps are advantageously implemented using a high power LED having a heat sink which can be mounted in a vary small volume inside the mirror housing <highlight><bold>3009</bold></highlight>. In particular, the map lamp <highlight><bold>3014</bold></highlight> can be implemented using a non-prismatic optical assembly according to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/109,527, entitled &ldquo;OPTICAL ASSEMBLY FOR SEMICONDUCTOR LIGHTING DEVICE ILLUMINATOR,&rdquo; filed on Jul. 2, 1998, by John K. Roberts et al., now abandoned, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Map lamp <highlight><bold>3012</bold></highlight> can be implemented using the prismatic optical assembly disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/109,527. Most preferably, the optical assemblies are modified to accommodate to LED lamps with heat extraction members as described below with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Some additional components and assemblies for vehicles will now be described with respect to a vehicle <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> and a vehicle <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>. The vehicles include a large number of lamps, any of which can advantageously employ an LED lamp having a heat sink to produce a brighter light than can be produced with conventional LEDs. In particular, the vehicle <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight> includes a driver side signal mirror <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a passenger side signal mirror <highlight><bold>3302</bold></highlight>. The driver side signal mirror <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is described in detail, in various embodiments, herein above, and includes a puddle lamp <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> through which an LED lamp emits light. The passenger side signal mirror <highlight><bold>3302</bold></highlight> can be implemented using a conventional passenger side mirror, such as an aspheric mirror, and additionally includes a signal lamp window <highlight><bold>3303</bold></highlight> for passage of emissions from an LED lamp and a puddle light <highlight><bold>3304</bold></highlight>. The LED lamps and window <highlight><bold>3303</bold></highlight> of signal mirror <highlight><bold>3302</bold></highlight> can be identical to LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and window <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of signal mirror <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A CHMSL <highlight><bold>3306</bold></highlight> is illustrated located on the rear of the vehicle mounted adjacent the rear window, although it could be located to emit light through the rear window <highlight><bold>3308</bold></highlight>, or on the trunk or rear fin in the case of a car. It will be recognized that the CHMSL using the heat sink LED lamps is uniquely able to produce from only a few LED lamps a bright light having a desired light pattern even through privacy glass of the types currently used in vehicles, which glass detrimentally attenuates the light from less powerful lamps. A rearview mirror <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> is positioned inside the vehicle and mounted in a conventional manner such as being affixed to the vehicle windshield or the headliner. The vehicle also includes tail lights/stop lamps <highlight><bold>3310</bold></highlight>, turn signal lamps <highlight><bold>3312</bold></highlight>, and back up lights <highlight><bold>3314</bold></highlight>. A license plate illuminator <highlight><bold>3316</bold></highlight> is positioned on the rear hatch adjacent the license plate <highlight><bold>3318</bold></highlight>. A vehicle <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> includes signal mirrors <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3302</bold></highlight>, brake lights <highlight><bold>3310</bold></highlight>&prime;, turn signals <highlight><bold>3312</bold></highlight>&prime;, back up lights <highlight><bold>3314</bold></highlight>&prime;, and a CHMSL <highlight><bold>3406</bold></highlight>. The vehicle also includes cargo lights <highlight><bold>3404</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3408</bold></highlight> to illuminate the bed of the vehicle (the illustrated vehicle <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> being a pick up truck), and as illustrated, the CHMSL <highlight><bold>3406</bold></highlight> and cargo lights are integrated into a lamp assembly <highlight><bold>3402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> More particularly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the CHMSL <highlight><bold>3306</bold></highlight> includes housing <highlight><bold>3500</bold></highlight>. The housing is illustrated as an elongated box, but can be configured in any shape desired by the vehicle designer. The housing <highlight><bold>3500</bold></highlight> can be of any suitable conventional manufacture, such as molded of an organic polymer. The LED lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight> are mounted on a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>3506</bold></highlight> that is mounted on housing <highlight><bold>3500</bold></highlight> using a mechanical fastener, an adhesive, or any other suitable mechanism. An optional member <highlight><bold>3508</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a rectangular substantially flat opaque shroud shaped to extend over the entire opening of the housing except for the lens portion of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight>. Member <highlight><bold>3508</bold></highlight> may, for example, be a molded black plastic piece, a paper product, or optionally a reflector of a manufacture similar to that used to manufacture a flash light reflector positioned around the flash light lamp. If the member <highlight><bold>3508</bold></highlight> is a reflector, it will be recognized that member will be shaped so as to reflect light from the LED lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight> forwardly through a lens <highlight><bold>3509</bold></highlight>. Lens <highlight><bold>3509</bold></highlight> is positioned on the housing and extends over the opening therein to operate with the LED lamps to create a desired light pattern for the CHMSL as described in greater detail hereinbelow. The lens can be manufactured from clear or colored material and may be, for example, a red transparent acrylic or polycarbonate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, the LED lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight> are preferably high power LED lamps of the type including a heat sink. Each of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight> can advantageously have one or more red-orange emitters (e.g., <highlight><bold>3604</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>) on a heat extraction member <highlight><bold>3510</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3513</bold></highlight>. The emitters for each LED lamp are positioned to radiate light through a lens <highlight><bold>3514</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3517</bold></highlight>. The lens has a radius of curvature that produces a moderately focused light beam. The heat extraction member <highlight><bold>3510</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3513</bold></highlight> of each LED lamp is positioned on a respective heat sink <highlight><bold>3520</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3523</bold></highlight>. The heat sinks can be etched out of a conductive layer of the circuit board <highlight><bold>3506</bold></highlight> using conventional circuit etching techniques, particularly where the circuit board has conductive layers on both sides thereof, or the heat sinks can be formed by coating the circuit board substrate to form a thermally conductive plate on the exterior surface of the dielectric substrate. The electrical leads <highlight><bold>3525</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3527</bold></highlight> (only numbered for one of the LED lamps to reduce clutter in the drawing) of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight> are bent to extend through vias in the circuit board <highlight><bold>3506</bold></highlight>, and are electrically connected to circuitry surface mounted to the back of the circuit board <highlight><bold>3506</bold></highlight>. The leads <highlight><bold>3525</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3527</bold></highlight> are electrically coupled to the circuit components by circuit traces etched in the conductive layer on the back of the circuit board by conventional means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The lens <highlight><bold>3509</bold></highlight> is preferably a large radius cylindrical or aspheric surface. The lens can be colored or clear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> To assemble the CHMSL <highlight><bold>3306</bold></highlight>, the circuitry <highlight><bold>3612</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>) and the LED lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight> are mounted on opposite sides of board <highlight><bold>3506</bold></highlight>. In particular, the exposed surface of the heat extraction member on the underside of each of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight> is in juxtaposition with a respective heat sink <highlight><bold>3520</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3523</bold></highlight> on the printed circuit board, and the leads <highlight><bold>3525</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3527</bold></highlight> for each lamp are soldered onto the board. The circuit board is snapped into the connectors <highlight><bold>3600</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight>, two of which are shown, but it will be recognized that more than two connectors can be provided, the actual number depending on the rigidity and size of the board. The shroud <highlight><bold>3508</bold></highlight> is preferably resilient, such that it can be bent slightly and inserted between projecting tabs <highlight><bold>3614</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3616</bold></highlight> and when released is held by the tabs in the housing. A respective opening <highlight><bold>3536</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3539</bold></highlight> is aligned with each lens <highlight><bold>3514</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3517</bold></highlight> to pass the light produced by the LEDs. The optional lens <highlight><bold>3509</bold></highlight> is mounted to the housing <highlight><bold>3500</bold></highlight> using a mechanical fastener, a snap connection, an adhesive, or the like. The lens closes the housing, providing some environmental protection against bugs and dirt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The CHMSL requirements for candelas emitted at different angles is represented by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. The center, C, is at 0&deg;, 0&deg; on the chart, and represents the candelas emitted straight out from the center of the CHMSL. The center cross represents the candelas emitted 5&deg; upwardly and 5&deg; downwardly of center, and 5&deg; to the left and 5&deg; to the right of center. The U-shaped area to the left includes the points 5&deg; left and 5&deg; down, 10&deg; left and 5&deg; off center, 10&deg; left, 10&deg; left and 5&deg; up, and 5&deg; left and 5&deg; up. The U-shaped area to the right of the center cross includes the right hand points corresponding to the left-hand points. The ribbon across the top includes points 10&deg; upwardly from center at 5&deg; intervals from 10&deg; left to 10&deg; right. The number at each axis of the chart represents the required candelas emitted in each direction, and the actual emission must be at least 60 percent of the number given for each point. Thus, the emissions in a direction straight out from the center of the CHMSL must be at least 15 candelas. An additional requirement is that the sum of area 1 must be at least 125 cd, the sum of points within area 2 must be greater than 98 cd, the sum of points in area 3 must be at least 98 cd, and the sum of points within area 4 must be at least 32 cd. An additional requirement is that the minimum area of the CHMSL must be at least 4.5 in.<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. A third requirement is that the total output is no more than 130 cd at an angle greater than 0.25&deg; from any of the measuring points in the field extending from 10&deg; up to 5&deg; down, and 10&deg; left to 10&deg; right. Maximums are measured within 60 seconds of an &ldquo;ON&rdquo; event within a temperature range from 18&deg; of 38&deg; C. Minimums are measured at thermal equilibrium or 30 mins, whichever occurs first, with ambient temperature within a temperature range from 18&deg; to 38&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> A iso-candela emission plot using a dual red-orange chip LED lamp implemented according to U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,548, which is incorporated herein by reference, is set forth in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>. In particular, the lens has a radius of 2.5 mm, the center 0.4 mm below the top of the body curve, the aperture is 4.9356 mm at the top of the body cube, the body cube is 3.8 mm high, and the distance from the top of the chip to the base of the lens is 2.77 mm. The illumination profile of this LED lamp is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</cross-reference>, the focused output is directional. Having an intensity of approximately 13 cd at a viewing angle of 0&deg; and falling off to 0 cd at angles over 45&deg;. The intensity is approximately 8 cd at an angle of 10&deg; to the left or right. The intensity is approximately 11 cd at an angle of approximately 10&deg; up. Because the output of the LED lamps will be additive, it can be seen that a pair of such LEDs can be used to produce the required CHMSL signal intensity. The LED lamp was mounted on a circuit board, with the top layer of the circuit board providing the heat sink. Providing four LEDs thus enables redundancy and permits a significant amount of flexibility in the CHMSL implementation. In particular, the power supply to the LED can be reduced, single chip LEDs can be used instead of double chip LEDs, and the CHMSL having only four LED lamps can be positioned behind dark privacy glass and still produce the required light intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the CHMSL and cargo lamp assembly <highlight><bold>3402</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>) includes circuit board <highlight><bold>4000</bold></highlight> in housing <highlight><bold>4002</bold></highlight>. The LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4005</bold></highlight> provide the illumination for the left side cargo lamp <highlight><bold>3404</bold></highlight>. The LED lamps <highlight><bold>4006</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4009</bold></highlight> provide the illumination for the CHMSL <highlight><bold>3406</bold></highlight>. The LED lamps <highlight><bold>4010</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight> provide the illumination for the right side cargo lamp <highlight><bold>3408</bold></highlight>. Each of the LEDs can be implemented using an LED lamp having a heat extraction member. The LED lamps are mounted in the same manner as described above with respect to CHMSL <highlight><bold>3306</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>), each of the LED lamps having a heat extraction member positioned on a heat sink <highlight><bold>4020</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4027</bold></highlight> located on a surface of the printed circuit board. The LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4005</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4010</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight> preferably direct light downwardly toward the bed of vehicle <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>), whereas the CHMSL LED lamps emit light as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. It is envisioned that this downwardly directed illumination will be provided using optical means where the cargo light LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4005</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4010</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight> are mounted in parallel, such as on a common circuit board with the CHMSL lamps <highlight><bold>4006</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4009</bold></highlight>. An example of an optical assembly that can be used will be described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Another mounting arrangement that can be used for LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight> and LED lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight> is disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and will be described with respect to LED lamp <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>, although the other LED lamps can be mounted in the same manner. This arrangement includes: a heat sink plate <highlight><bold>4030</bold></highlight>; an electrical insulator layer <highlight><bold>4032</bold></highlight>; circuit board <highlight><bold>4001</bold></highlight>&prime; having a dielectric substrate layer <highlight><bold>4036</bold></highlight> and a conductor layer <highlight><bold>4034</bold></highlight>; and a thermally conductive, electrically nonconductive layer <highlight><bold>4038</bold></highlight>. The circuit board <highlight><bold>4001</bold></highlight>&prime; in this arrangement includes a hole cut at the mounting position for each of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight>. Each of the holes is preferably larger than the heat extraction member <highlight><bold>4040</bold></highlight> of each of the LED lamps. Each of the LED lamps is mounted to the circuit board on an electronically non-conductive side thereof, with the leads bent 90&deg; for insertion into vias in the circuit board. The leads are electrically connected to conductors in the conductor layer <highlight><bold>4034</bold></highlight> of the PCB <highlight><bold>4000</bold></highlight>&prime;, which conductor layer is formed by etching a conductor layer or application of conductive ink, or application of a conductive coating, or the like. A layer <highlight><bold>4038</bold></highlight> of resilient, thermally conductive, electrically nonconductive material is inserted into the opening under the LED lamp. The layer <highlight><bold>4038</bold></highlight> can be provided using a preformed thermal coupler such as a silicon based, cut resistant material commercially available from Bergquist, and identified as Silipad <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. Two sides of the material can have an adhesive applied thereto, such that it sticks to the LED lamp and the circuit board. Additionally, a nylon screw (not shown) can be inserted through the heat extraction member and the board, and tightened using a bolt (not shown). Where the board is 0.062 inch thick and the Silipad is 0.009 inch thick, the bolt and screw can be used to squeeze the LED lamp, the layer <highlight><bold>4038</bold></highlight>, and the plate into engagement. The thermally conductive material can include a thermally conductive adhesive coating to bond the layer to the heat extraction member <highlight><bold>4040</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> An electrical insulator layer <highlight><bold>4032</bold></highlight> is coated on the heat sink plate <highlight><bold>4030</bold></highlight>, at least in those regions of the heat extraction member that would otherwise contact the circuit board conductive layer <highlight><bold>4034</bold></highlight>. The insulating coating can be any suitable dielectric, and may be, for example, porcelain, powder, a suitable polymeric adhesive, or the like. Although the hole in the board, and the heat extraction member, are preferably larger than the heat extraction member <highlight><bold>4040</bold></highlight>, to provide the maximum amount of heat transfer through the board to the plate <highlight><bold>4030</bold></highlight> so they can be made smaller. A smaller opening could be provided to permit mounting of the LED lamp extraction member to the surface of the circuit board, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Another alternative mounting arrangement for the LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight> and LED lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. This alternate mounting arrangement is described with reference to the CHMSL and cargo lamp assembly <highlight><bold>3402</bold></highlight>. It will be recognized that the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is applicable to the CHMSL lamps <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3505</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4006</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4007</bold></highlight>, whereas the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>effects the downwardly projecting illumination desired for LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4005</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4010</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight>. In this alternative mounting arrangement, the circuit board <highlight><bold>4060</bold></highlight> is mounted in housing <highlight><bold>4002</bold></highlight> generally orthogonal to the CHMSL LED lamps <highlight><bold>4006</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4009</bold></highlight>. The leads <highlight><bold>4041</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4041</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>4043</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4043</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>4045</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>4045</bold></highlight>&prime; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) (numbered only for lamp <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4006</bold></highlight> to improve drawing readability) of the LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight> can thus be inserted into the boards using conventional automated radial insertion equipment. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the LED lamps <highlight><bold>4006</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4009</bold></highlight> are mounted to a heat sink <highlight><bold>4070</bold></highlight> using suitable adhesive, such as a thermally conductive adhesive. The heat sink is supported on housing <highlight><bold>4002</bold></highlight> by legs <highlight><bold>4072</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4074</bold></highlight>. The legs are attached to housing <highlight><bold>4002</bold></highlight> by feet <highlight><bold>4076</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4078</bold></highlight>, which may be mounted using any suitable conventional means such as a fastener, an adhesive, or the like. The heat sink is of any suitable construction providing a thermally conductive planar member, such as stamped from a metal, and may be copper, aluminum, an aluminum alloy, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The cargo light LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4005</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4010</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight> are mounted at a downwardly directed angle as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The downwardly directed angle is provided by bending the leads <highlight><bold>4041</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4043</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4045</bold></highlight> such that the LED lamps can be focused on the bed of the vehicle <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight>. The LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4005</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4010</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight> include a heat sink <highlight><bold>4080</bold></highlight> mounted directly thereto, and are supported on a reflector <highlight><bold>4082</bold></highlight> used to focus light on the desired illumination region of the bed of vehicle <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight>. The reflector can be of any suitable construction, such as a molded organic polymer having a chrome coating, or a conventional construction such as those used to make flashlight reflectors. As can be seen, the LED lamp and the reflector are directed downwardly. The reflector can be mounted to the LED lamp encapsulant, the housing <highlight><bold>4002</bold></highlight>, and/or the lens <highlight><bold>3509</bold></highlight>&prime;, and such mountings can be made using an adhesive, an adhesive tape, a mechanical connector, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The lens <highlight><bold>3509</bold></highlight>&prime; is implemented using a large radius, cylindrical or aspheric, member transparent at the wavelength of interest, and may be a clear transparent element across its entire length if the LED lamps <highlight><bold>4006</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4009</bold></highlight> include red-orange or red elements. For example, the element may be molded of a clear polymer material, such as an acrylic, and can include a diffusing surface on the exterior side of the element. An advantage to using a clear element with red LEDs is that the brake lamp area will be clear when it is not illuminated by the LEDs and red when it is illuminated, thus providing a significant contrast between the illuminated and not illuminated states. A disadvantage to the clear element is that some observers expect the brake light to be red when it is not illuminated. Accordingly, the lens can be clear in the cargo lamp <highlight><bold>3404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3408</bold></highlight> areas and red in the CHMSL <highlight><bold>3406</bold></highlight> area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> An optical assembly <highlight><bold>4100</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</cross-reference> that can be used to produce downwardly directed cargo lamps from the LED lamps <highlight><bold>4004</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4005</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4010</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4011</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>, or the map lights <highlight><bold>3012</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3014</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>. The optical assembly <highlight><bold>4100</bold></highlight> is used with a high power LED lamp <highlight><bold>4102</bold></highlight>. The optical assembly is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/109,527, although it is modified herein to accommodate the high power LED lamp including a heat extraction member. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>4102</bold></highlight> includes an emitter <highlight><bold>4104</bold></highlight> mounted on a top planar surface of heat extraction member <highlight><bold>4106</bold></highlight>. The heat extraction member <highlight><bold>4106</bold></highlight> is mounted flat on circuit board <highlight><bold>4110</bold></highlight>. The heat extraction member <highlight><bold>4106</bold></highlight> is juxtaposed with the heat sink layer <highlight><bold>4112</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>4114</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>4110</bold></highlight>. The emitter <highlight><bold>4104</bold></highlight> is covered by a transparent encapsulant <highlight><bold>4108</bold></highlight>, which is preferably cylindrical to be accommodated within the TIR <highlight><bold>4117</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4200</bold></highlight>. In particular, the optical assembly includes a collimator lens <highlight><bold>4116</bold></highlight>, a TIR lens <highlight><bold>4117</bold></highlight> and a prism <highlight><bold>4118</bold></highlight>. The collimator lens and TIR lens direct the light radiated from emitter <highlight><bold>4104</bold></highlight> forward, and the prism redirects the light at the desired angle. The exit surface <highlight><bold>4130</bold></highlight> of the optical assembly is preferably a diffuser. The emitter <highlight><bold>4104</bold></highlight> can be a phosphor LED chip which produces white light, an LED using red, green, and blue elements, or a binary complementary LED. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> It will be recognized that the optical assembly <highlight><bold>4100</bold></highlight>, including the prism <highlight><bold>4118</bold></highlight>, will be used for map light <highlight><bold>3014</bold></highlight>, whereas the prism is omitted for map lamp <highlight><bold>3012</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the map lamps <highlight><bold>3012</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3014</bold></highlight> can each be implemented using a single LED lamp, such that only half of the optical assembly <highlight><bold>4100</bold></highlight> would be provided, or two or more LED lamps. </paragraph>

This LED lamp is according to the LED lamps in U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,548 incorporated herein by reference, and has a 4.25 mm lens radius. The LED lamp is mounted on a circuit board layer heat sink. It can be seen that two LED lamps so mounted produce the required illumination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> A lamp assembly <highlight><bold>4500</bold></highlight> that can be used to implement a dome light, a brake light, a turn signal, a license plate illuminator, or any other vehicle light module is disclosed in FIGS. <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The lamp assembly includes a housing <highlight><bold>4502</bold></highlight> having an integral socket <highlight><bold>4504</bold></highlight> for receipt of a lamp <highlight><bold>4506</bold></highlight>. The side walls <highlight><bold>4510</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4513</bold></highlight> circumscribe the socket and extend upwardly to define a rectangular opening. The LED lamp <highlight><bold>4506</bold></highlight> may be implemented using any suitable high power LED, and is preferably implemented using a high power LED lamp having an integral heat extraction member, and may be implemented in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,548. The LED lamp includes a heat extraction member <highlight><bold>4520</bold></highlight>, an emitter (<highlight><bold>4602</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>) carried on the heat extraction member, and an encapsulant <highlight><bold>4522</bold></highlight> covering the emitter. Electrical leads <highlight><bold>4523</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4524</bold></highlight> extend outwardly from the encapsulant and are bent downwardly for connection to contacts <highlight><bold>4530</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4531</bold></highlight>. The socket <highlight><bold>4504</bold></highlight> includes openings <highlight><bold>4532</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4535</bold></highlight> for each of the four leads on the LED lamp (only two of which are visible) and respective contacts (only two of which are shown) to pass through. The contacts <highlight><bold>4530</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4531</bold></highlight> are mounted on a circuit board <highlight><bold>4540</bold></highlight>, which may, for example, include contact pads <highlight><bold>4542</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4545</bold></highlight> to which the contacts <highlight><bold>4530</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4531</bold></highlight> are connected. The circuit components <highlight><bold>4552</bold></highlight> are connected to the circuit board on a lower surface, and in particular can be surface mounted according to conventional techniques. When fully assembled, the contacts <highlight><bold>4530</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4531</bold></highlight> hold the LED lamp <highlight><bold>4506</bold></highlight> within the socket as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> A reflective coating <highlight><bold>4550</bold></highlight> is applied to the inner surface of side walls <highlight><bold>4510</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4513</bold></highlight>. A diffusing lens <highlight><bold>4604</bold></highlight> is provided. The lens can be manufactured according to known, conventional techniques, and may be molded, for example, of a transparent acrylic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that the shape of the housing <highlight><bold>4502</bold></highlight> can be altered to provide the appropriate size for the application. Additionally, for an application such as a license plate, the reflector and lens can be small and shaped to have low profile. License plate illuminators are shaped so as to direct light onto the plate while blocking light from being directly radiated outwardly from the back of the vehicle. It will be further recognized that the lamp may be assembled to include more than one socket, or the socket can have room to receive more than one lamp. In either manner, more than one lamp can be accommodated within the housing whereby more light may be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> A step down circuit is disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>. The step down circuit provides a regulated current to the LED lamps of the CHMSL, puddle lamp, map light, license plate illuminator, back-up light, turn signal lamp, brake lamp, or any other lamp in the vehicle. The circuit is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/426,794 entitled &ldquo;POWER SUPPLY FOR ELECTROCHROMIC MIRRORS IN HIGH VOLTAGE AUTOMOTIVE POWER SYSTEMS&rdquo; and filed on Oct. 22, 1999, by Robert R. Turnbull, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,262,831, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. The circuit <highlight><bold>4800</bold></highlight> preferably only differs from the circuit of the other application by the inclusion of shunt transistors Q<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the value of capacitor C<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In particular, the transistors Q<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are connected in parallel with respective emitters D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. These emitters can be, for example, binary complementary LED chips selected to produce white light. Alternatively, they could be selected to provide other colors, or they can be two chips that produce the same color. The controller generates control signals input to shunt transistors Q<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to dynamically adjust the output thereof. By selecting a small enough capacitor value for the output capacitor C<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the shunt transistors can be used to turn the LED lamp <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>&prime; OFF. Additionally, the shunt transistors Q<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be used to adjust the current in each of the emitters, by diverting current in a parallel bypass path through the transistors. Additionally, one or both of the transistors Q<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be turned OFF such that the full current flows through the respective LED emitter connected in parallel therewith. The controller can thus control the current through the transistor switches and the LED lamps. This is advantageous where it may be desirable to flash the LEDs responsive to a control signal generated by controller <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, instead of the vehicle turn signal control, in an application such as a signal mirror turn signal repeater. Additionally, the light output of the LED lamp used for an illuminator may be controlled to a desired intensity, either responsive to a manual control by a user or an &ldquo;opera&rdquo; effect wherein the lights automatically gradually fade out when the lights are turned off. Another application where the independent LED emitter control is desirable is where it is necessary to change the color of the LED lamp. Where two or more different colored LED chips are used in a single LED lamp, the current input to each of the LED lamps can be independently varied to change the color emitted by the LED lamp. In these and other applications, the independent current control can be provided for a series connected emitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Although the circuit <highlight><bold>4800</bold></highlight> disclosed is for series connected emitters, those skilled in the art will recognize that the circuit can be modified to accommodate common cathode LED lamps as well. For common cathode emitters, the transistors Q<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> would be connected in series with the respective emitters as opposed to the parallel connection shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in detail herein in accordance with certain embodiments thereof, many modifications and changes may be effected by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, the high power LED lamp including a heat extraction member can be employed in mirror structures such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,497,306; 5,361, 190; and 5,788,357, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, to significantly improve the performance thereof. Accordingly, it is our intent to be limited only by the scope of the appending claims and not by way of details and instrumentalities describing the embodiments shown herein. </paragraph>
