<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a recording medium having lands and grooves for recording information formed on a substrate, particularly a magnetic super resolution recording medium that utilizes a magnetic super resolution method for reproducing the recorded information, and to a process for manufacturing the medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The magnetic super resolution method is used for reading a recorded mark that is smaller than the diffraction limitation of a laser beam by irradiating a laser beam and by applying a magnetic field. The marks of information are recorded on a magnetic super resolution recording medium having a multilayered magnetic film by irradiating a laser beam and by applying a magnetic field. This method can enhance a recording density of a magneto-optic recording medium so as to support a large-capacity that is required to a recording medium along with a rapid progress in recent technology of a personal computer and its peripheral. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The magnetic super resolution method includes some variations. For example, the double mask RAD method, which is disclosed in Japanese unexamined patent publication No. 7-244877, uses two magnetic masks, i.e., a front mask and a rear mask. The front mask is an area of relatively low temperature heated by irradiation of laser beam, while the rear mask is an area that is heated to the highest temperature by the irradiation of laser beam. In these mask areas of the multilayered magnetic film, the magnetized information cannot be transferred from a recording layer to a reproducing layer. The transfer of the magnetized information from the recording layer to the reproducing layer can be performed only in the intermediate temperature area located between the two mask areas, so that the magnetized information can be reproduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to support recent higher recording density and larger capacity, it is under research to apply land and groove recording to the above-mentioned magnetic super resolution recording medium. In the land and groove recording, information is recorded on both the land and the groove. Here, the land is a protruding line portion that has been used for recording information, and the groove is a portion between the lands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A recording medium (e.g., a magneto-optic disk) including the above-mentioned magnetic super resolution recording medium is usually manufactured by the following process. First, a photoresist is applied to a glass master disk and exposured by a laser beam so as to form a groove and pit pattern. The glass master disk is developed so that the exposed portion is removed, and a pitted surface is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Next, an electrode film is formed on the pitted surface by utilizing a vapor deposition method, an electroless plating method or a spattering method, followed by electroforming so that a stamper is manufactured. Then a replica is manufactured from the stamper by an ultraviolet curable resin method (i.e., a photopolymer method or a 2P method) or by an injection molding method. This conventional process can hardly control the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the land or the groove as well as a wall angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is a problem that an intensity of a magnetic field that is necessary for reproducing information becomes larger when the above-mentioned land and groove recording is applied to the magnetic super resolution recording medium. Especially, when the land and groove recording method is applied to the above-mentioned double mask RAD method, the magnetic field that is necessary for generating the front mask becomes above 500 Oe. As a result, a power consumption of a coil for generating the magnetic field and a driving circuit of the coil increases. Otherwise, a substantial engineering change of the coil for generating the magnetic field is required. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to provide a recording medium that can reduce the increase of the magnetic field that is necessary for reproduction and is suitable for the magnetic super resolution reproduction and a process for manufacturing the medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A recording medium according to the present invention has lands and grooves formed on a substrate for recording information. At least one of the land and the groove has an edge portion whose radius of curvature is greater than one sixth of the width of the land or the groove. Preferably, the recording medium is a magnetic super resolution recording medium from which recorded information is reproduced by a magnetic super resolution method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> By rounding the shape of the edge portion as mentioned above, it was verified in the experiment that the intensity of the magnetic field to be applied for reproduction by the magnetic super resolution method could be decreased. One of the reasons is that a heat distribution shape of the laser irradiated portion may change by rounding the shape of the edge portion. Another reason is that a thickness of the magnetic recording film can be uniform if the radius of curvature of the edge portion is large. It is found that the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the groove affects greater than that of the land. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A first process of the present invention for manufacturing the recording medium comprises the steps of forming a resist pattern on a substrate that can be processed by plasma etching utilizing a photolithography method, using the resist pattern as a mask for dry etching, etching the substrate by spattering after removing a residual resist pattern so as to enlarge a radius of curvature of an edge portion of a groove, making a stamper to which the shape of the etching pattern is transferred, making a substrate of a recording medium using the stamper, and forming a recording film on the substrate of the recording medium. </paragraph>

Though this process is suitable for manufacturing the above-mentioned magnetic super resolution recording medium, it can be also used for manufacturing other kinds of recording medium. It is true for the following processes, too. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A second process of the present invention for manufacturing a recording medium comprises the steps of forming a resist pattern on a substrate utilizing a photolithography method, deforming the resist pattern by heat, making a stamper to which the shape of the resist pattern is transferred, using the stamper for making a substrate of a recording medium, and forming a recording film on the substrate of the recording medium. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A fourth process of the present invention for manufacturing a recording medium comprises the steps of forming a resist pattern on a substrate utilizing a photolithography method, deforming the resist pattern by heat, making a first stamper to which the shape of the resist pattern is transferred, making a second stamper to which the shape of the first stamper is transferred, using the second stamper for making a substrate of a recording medium, and forming a recording film on the substrate of the recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A fifth process of the present invention for manufacturing a recording medium comprises the steps of irradiating a master disk having a pitted surface shape with ultraviolet rays emitted by a low voltage mercury lamp so as to enlarge a radius of curvature of an edge portion of the pitted surface shape, using the master disk having the enlarged radius of curvature at the edge portion so as to make a stamper, using the stamper for making a substrate of a recording medium, and forming a recording film on the substrate of the recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the wavelength of the ultraviolet rays emitted from the low voltage mercury lamp be less than 254 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The master disk is preferably manufactured by the process comprising the steps of forming a pitted surface shape on a resist pattern utilizing a photolithography method, forming an electrode film on the pitted surface, making a stamper by electroforming with the electrode film, and using the stamper for transferring the pitted surface shape to an ultraviolet curable resin. Thus, the master disk can be duplicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Another preferable process for manufacturing the master disk comprises the steps of forming a pitted surface shape on a resist pattern utilizing a photolithography method, forming an electrode film on the pitted surface, making a stamper by electroforming with the electrode film, and using the stamper for transferring the pitted surface shape by resin molding. Thus, the master disk can be duplicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A sixth process of the present invention for manufacturing a recording medium comprises the steps of applying a photoresist on a substrate and making an intermediate layer by performing a predetermined deactivation process to the photoresist, applying another photoresist to be a pitted surface layer on the intermediate layer, forming a pitted surface shape on the pitted surface layer utilizing a photolithography method, enlarging a radius of curvature of an edge portion of the pitted surface shape by a predetermined process, making a stamper by using a master having the edge portion of the pitted surface shape whose radius of curvature was enlarged, using the stamper for making a substrate of a recording medium, and forming a recording film on the substrate of the recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the deactivation process be a baking process under a temperature higher than the pre-baking temperature, whereby the intermediate layer changes the properties so as not to be mixed with the photoresist of the pitted surface layer and so as to lose the photosensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable that the process for manufacturing a recording medium further comprises the step of performing a baking process to the pitted surface layer after forming the pitted surface shape of the resist pattern, and that the baking process be the same as that of the deactivation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the step of making an intermediate layer, the photoresist can be replaced with an ultraviolet curable resin, which is applied and cured to be the intermediate layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable that in the process for enlarging the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the pitted surface shape, the exposed surface of the intermediate layer be also processed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to embodiments and accompanied drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a magnified view showing a structure of lands and grooves of a magnetic super resolution recording medium (a magneto-optic disk) according to the present invention. In this magnetic super resolution recording medium, the edge portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the land <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the edge portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have a round shape without a keen edge. The radius of curvature is greater than one sixth of the width of the land or the groove. The maximum value of the radius of curvature is limited naturally by the width of the land <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and groove <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a magnified view showing another structure of lands and grooves of a magnetic super resolution recording medium according to the present invention. In this magnetic super resolution recording medium, the edge portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the land <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a rectangular section with a keen edge, while the edge portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has a round shape whose radius of curvature is greater than one sixth of the width of the land or the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a process for manufacturing a recording medium according to a first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> First, in the step (a), a glass master disk <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> having a low surface roughness less than 50 angstroms is prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the step (b), the glass master disk <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is coated with a positive type photoresist by spin-coating so as to form a resist film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the resist film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is set to approximately 100 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the step (c), a pregroove writer is used for exposing the resist film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the land width (and the groove width) becomes 0.6 &mgr;m, and the resist film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is developed by a wet process. Thus, a resist pattern <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whose land width and groove width are both 0.6 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the step (d), the resist pattern <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is used as a mask for reactive ion etching (RIE) of the glass master disk <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Preferably, a trifluoromethane (CHF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) is used as an etching gas. The glass master disk <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is etched by approximately 50 nm under the condition of gas pressure 0.5 Pa, flow rate 5 sccm, and RF power 200 W. However, this etching process is not limited to the above-mentioned condition. Other gas such as a tetrafluoromethane (CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) or an 8-fluoro butane (C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>) can be used as the etching gas. After the etching, the residual resist pattern <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is removed by an oxygen plasma ashing. As a result, pregrooves having a rectangular section as shown in (d) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are formed on the glass master disk <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the step (e), a spatter etching process is performed to the glass master disk <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> with the pregroove formed, using preferably an argon gas under the condition of gas pressure 0.5 Pa, flow rate 60 sccm and RF power 1 kW for approximately 10 minutes. As an effect of the spatter etching, the radius of curvature of the edge portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the groove is enlarged. By altering the etching condition, the increase of the radius of curvature can be controlled. Other gas such as CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, CHF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, can be used as the etching gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the step (f), maintaining the vacuum state of the step (e), a nickel thin film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed by spattering method to a thickness of approximately 50 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the step (g), an electroforming is performed by using the nickel thin film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as an electrode film so as to form a nickel film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a thickness of approximately 300 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the step (h), the nickel film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is exfoliated from the glass master disk <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Thus, a stamper <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> made of the nickel film is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the final step (i), the stamper <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is used for making a replica disk <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by an ultraviolet curable resin method (a 2 P method) or an injection molding method. Thus, the radius of curvature of the groove edge portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the replica disk <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be greater than one sixth of the width of the land or the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The replica disk <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is used as a substrate, on which a magnetic film having a three-layered structure is formed as disclosed in Japanese unexamined patent publication No. 7-244877. In this way, a magnetic super resolution recording medium that is a magneto-optic disk is manufactured, and the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the groove is greater than one sixth of the width of the land or the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The magneto-optic disk that was manufactured by the above-mentioned process was measured by a magneto-optic disk tester (a wavelength of a light source is 685 nm, and a numerical aperture of an object lens is 0.55). The result of the measurement showed that the magnetic field necessary for forming the front mask in a groove is reduced substantially from the conventional 500 Oe to 180 Oe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graph showing a magnetic field for generating the front mask and the rear mask (magnetic super resolution masks) in the reproduction by the magnetic super resolution method when altering the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the groove. As understood from this graph, along with the increase of the radius of curvature, the magnetic field for generating particularly the front mask-is decreased. If the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the groove is greater than 100 nm, the magnetic field for generating the magnetic super resolution mask can be less than 400 Oe. Namely, since the manufactured magnetic super resolution medium has the land width (and the groove width) of 0.6 &mgr;m, the magnetic field for generating the magnetic super resolution mask can be less than 400 Oe by setting the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the groove to a value greater than one sixth of the width of the land (or the groove). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is found that since the magnetic field for generating the magnetic super resolution mask is higher in a land than in a groove, the effect of reducing the magnetic field for generating the magnetic super resolution mask by enlarging the radius of curvature can be obtained more in a groove. Therefore, it is not always necessary to enlarge the radius of curvature of the edge portion both of the land and the groove. A sufficient effect may be obtained by enlarging the radius of curvature of the edge portion only of the groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if a pregroove pattern is formed on the glass master disk by reactive ion etching, the edge portions of the land and the groove become almost rectangular due to the effect of the anisotropic etching. Adding a spatter etching process under the condition of isotropic etching, the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the groove can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a process for manufacturing a recording medium according to a second embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> First, in the step (a), a glass master disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> having a low surface roughness less than 50 angstroms is prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the step (b), the glass master disk <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is coated with a positive type photoresist by spin-coating so as to form a resist film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the resist film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set to approximately 50 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the next step (c), a pregroove writer is used for exposing the resist film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is then developed by a wet process. Thus, a resist pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is formed. Since the development by the wet process is an isotropic process including solution in a solvent, the resist pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> generated by this process has a land whose radius of curvature of the edge portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is enlarged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the step (d), a nickel thin film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having a thickness of approximately 50 nm is formed on the resist pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by using preferably a spattering method, a vapor deposition method or an electroless method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the step (e), the nickel thin film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is used as an electrode film for electroforming, so as to form a nickel film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a thickness of approximately 300 &mgr;m. By exfoliating the nickel film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the resist pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, a stamper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> made of the nickel film is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the next step (f), the stamper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is used for making an intermediate mold <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by an ultraviolet curable resin method (i.e., a 2P method) or an injection molding method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the next step (g), the pitted surface pattern of the intermediate mold <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is transferred to the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that is formed on a glass master disk <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the next step (h), a nickel film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is formed on the pitted surface of the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by spattering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the next step (i), the nickel film <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is used as an electrode for electroforming so as to form a nickel layer, which becomes a stamper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the final step (j), the stamper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is used for making a replica disk <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> by an ultraviolet curable resin method (i.e., a 2P method) or an injection molding method. Thus, the pitted surface pattern of the resist pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is transferred to the intermediate mold <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and is further transferred to the stamper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the land edge portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a large radius of curvature formed by the resist pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is transferred from the intermediate mold <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the groove edge portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and is further transferred to the groove edge portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the replica disk <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> that is made by the stamper <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The method for making the reverse image of the resist pattern that is formed by exposing and developing is not limited to the method of the above-mentioned embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In addition, another method for enlarging the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the land and the groove can be adopted, in which by the resist pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> formed on the resist film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by using a pregroove writer is heated to the temperature close to the glass transition temperature of the resist material. As a result, the radii of curvature of the edge portions of the land and the groove of the resist pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> increase, and the radii of curvature of the edge portions of the land and the groove of the stamper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> made by using the resist pattern <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> increase. Then, the radii of curvature of the edge portions of the land and the groove of the replica disk made by using the stamper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In addition, the radii of curvature of the edge portions of the land and the groove can be increased by heating the replica disk made by using the stamper at the temperature that is lower than the glass transition temperature by approximately 10 degrees, too. The material of the replica disk is preferably a thermoplastic resin such as a polycarbonate or a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The heating process is performed at the temperature of 130 degrees centigrade for approximately 12 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a process for manufacturing a recording medium according to a third embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> First, in the step (a), a glass master disk <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> having a low surface roughness less than 50 angstroms is coated with a positive type photoresist by spin-coating so as to form a resist film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the step (b), a pregroove writer is used for exposing the resist film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is then developed by a wet process.

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the step (c), a nickel thin film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed on the resist pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by using a vapor deposition method. The thickness of the nickel thin film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is set to approximately 50 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the step (d), the nickel thin film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is used as an electrode film for electroforming, so as to form a nickel film <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> having a thickness of approximately 300 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the step (e), the nickel film <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is exfoliated from the glass master disk <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the resist pattern <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, so that a stamper <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the step (f), the stamper <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is used as a mother mold, whose pitted surface is coated with an ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which a glass master disk <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> contacts. The thickness of the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> between the stamper <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the glass master disk <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is set to approximately 30 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the step (g), the stamper <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the glass master disk <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> that are contacted to each other are irradiated by ultraviolet rays emitted from the ultraviolet ray irradiation apparatus <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> so that the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is cured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the step (h), exfoliating the stamper <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, a transfer glass master disk <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is completed that includes the glass master disk <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having the pitted surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the step (i), the above-mentioned transfer glass master disk <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is set in an ultraviolet ray irradiation apparatus including a low voltage mercury lamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The transfer glass master disk <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is irradiated with ultraviolet rays having a wavelength below 254 &mgr;m emitted from the low voltage mercury lamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> side for approximately two minutes. Preferably, the distance between the transfer glass master disk <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the low voltage mercury lamp <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is set to approximately 10 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> By this irradiation process with ultraviolet rays, the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the pitted surface of the transfer glass master disk <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> (i.e., the pitted surface of the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) is enlarged. The reason is considered to be that the ultraviolet rays generate ozone that etches the edge portion of the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a graph that shows the relationship between the irradiation time of the ultraviolet rays in the step (i) and the radius of curvature of the edge portion or an inclining angle of the wall. As understood from this graph, along with the increase of the irradiation time of the ultraviolet rays, the radius of curvature (shown in a chain line) of the edge portion increases, while the inclining angle of the wall (shown in a solid line) decreases (i.e., becomes gentle). In this result of measurement, the radius of curvature of the edge portion is approximately 280 nm and the angle of the wall is approximately 49 degrees when the irradiation time of the ultraviolet rays is two minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The following steps of making a stamper, making a replica disk by using the stamper and making a magneto-optic disk are the same as those explained in the first embodiment (the step (f) and the following steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). It was verified that the magneto-optic disk manufactured by the process of this embodiment also enable the external magnetic field for generating the front mask in the groove to decrease to 180 Oe in the same way as the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As a variation of the above-mentioned third embodiment, the glass master disk <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the step (f) and the following steps can be omitted by increasing the thickness of the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> up to approximately 6 mm. In this case, the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be cured by the irradiation with the ultraviolet rays for approximately four minutes. When the thickness of the ultraviolet curable resin is increased up to approximately 6 mm, the problem about the strength does not occur without the glass master disk <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. After the ultraviolet curable resin is cured, the stamper <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is exfoliated and the obtained ultraviolet curable resin master disk is used for performing the step (i) and the following steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As another variation of the above-mentioned third embodiment, the ultraviolet curable resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> used in the step (f) and the following steps can be replaced with a thermoplastic resin such as a polycarbonate. In this case too, if the thickness of the thermoplastic resin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is increased up to approximately 6 mm so as to increase the strength, the glass master disk <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> can be omitted. In the concrete steps, the stamper <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> made in the step (e) is attached to an injection molding machine, and a polycarbonate resin is injected so as to produce a resin mold having a thickness of approximately 6 mm. Then, the stamper <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is exfoliated and the obtained resin mold master disk is used for performing the step (i) and the following steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The material of the resin mold is not limited to a polycarbonate, but other thermoplastic resin that is suitable for duplicating a fine shape can be used. A thermosetting resin can be also used for resin molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a process for manufacturing a recording medium according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> First, in the step (a), a glass master disk <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is coated with a photoresist by spin-coating so as to form an intermediate layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the step (b), baking in an oven is performed at the temperature of 180&deg; C. for 60 minutes. Thus, the intermediate layer is not mixed with the photoresist thereover for forming the pitted surface layer and loses the photosensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In the step (c), the glass master disk <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is coated with a photoresist for forming a pitted surface up to the thickness of 50 nm so as to form a resist film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The material of the photoresist used for the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and that for the resist film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is the same. For example, Tokyo Ouka Corporation THMR-iP3300 can be used for them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the step (d), after prebaking at the temperature of 100&deg; C. for 30 minutes, exposing and developing are performed so as to form a pitted surface layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. This pitted surface layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is baked under the same condition as the intermediate layer so as to gain a surface strength that is similar to that of the intermediate layer. Though this step can be omitted, it is preferable to include the step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the step (e), the above-mentioned master disk including the glass master disk <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the pitted surface layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is set in the ultraviolet ray irradiation apparatus including a low voltage mercury lamp <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The master disk is irradiated with ultraviolet rays having a wavelength below 254 &mgr;m emitted from the low voltage mercury lamp <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> at the pitted surface layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> side for approximately 20 minutes. Preferably, the distance between the master disk and the low voltage mercury lamp <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is set to approximately 10 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> By this irradiation process with ultraviolet rays, the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the pitted surface layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is enlarged. The reason is considered to be that the ultraviolet rays generate ozone that etches the edge portion of the pitted surface layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a graph that shows the relationship between the irradiation time of the ultraviolet rays in the step (e) and the radius of curvature of the edge portion according to the measurement result. As understood from this graph, along with the increase of the irradiation time of the ultraviolet rays, the radius of curvature of the edge portion increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The following steps of making a stamper, making a replica disk by using the stamper and making a magneto-optic disk are the same as those explained in the first embodiment (the step (f) and the following steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The radius of curvature of the edge portion in the pitted surface manufactured by this embodiment was approximately 250 nm. It was verified that the magneto-optic disk manufactured by the process of this embodiment also enable the external magnetic field for generating the front mask in the groove to decrease to 180 Oe in the same way as the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In addition, the process of this embodiment has an advantage to the first or the second embodiment in that the depth of the pits formed in an ID portion of the recording medium can be controlled easily. Namely, the independent control of the depth of the groove and the pits in the recording area or the formation of different depths of pits is difficult in the first or the second embodiment, but is easy in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As a variation of the above-mentioned the fourth embodiment, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the step (a) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can be formed by using an ultraviolet curable resin instead of the photoresist. In an example, an ultraviolet curable resin was applied uniformly up to the thickness of 30 &mgr;m, and was irradiated with ultraviolet rays having the wavelength of 365 nm for approximately four minutes so as to cure the ultraviolet curable resin. After that, the same steps as the step (c) and the following steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> were performed. In this case too, the same effect as the fourth embodiment can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As another variation of the above-mentioned the fourth embodiment, the irradiation with the ultraviolet rays in the step (e) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can be replaced with spatter etching. In the same way as the ozone etching by the ultraviolet rays, the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the pitted surface layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be enlarged. In an example, an argon gas was used for spatter etching under the condition of gas pressure 0.5 Pa, flow rate 60 sccm, and RF power 1 kW for five minutes. After that, the same steps as the step (c) and the following steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> were performed. In this case too, the same effect as the fourth embodiment can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned two variations can be combined. Namely, the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the step (a) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> was formed by using an ultraviolet curable resin, and the irradiation with the ultraviolet rays in the step (e) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> was replaced with the spatter etching under the condition mentioned above. In this case too, the same effect as the fourth embodiment can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As still another variation of the above-mentioned the fourth embodiment, the step (d) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can be followed by a heating process of the master disk at the temperature of 270&deg; C. that is close to the glass transition temperature of the resist material for 30 minutes. Thus, the radius of curvature of the edge portion of the pitted surface layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is enlarged. Therefore, the irradiation with the ultraviolet rays in the step (e) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can be omitted. In this case too, the same effect as the fourth embodiment can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As explained above, in the recording medium of the present invention, at least one of the land and the groove (preferably the groove) has an edge portion whose radius of curvature is greater than one sixth of the width of the land or the groove. Thus, the intensity of a magnetic field for generating a magnetic super resolution mask can be reduced to a value less than 400 Oe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides various kinds of processes suitable for manufacturing the above-mentioned recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> While the presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited thereto, and that various changes and modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
