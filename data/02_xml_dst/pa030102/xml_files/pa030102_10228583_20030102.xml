<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A steerable endoscope has an elongated body with a selectively steerable distal portion and an automatically controlled proximal portion. The endoscope body is inserted into a patient and the selectively steerable distal portion is used to select a desired path within the patient&apos;s body. When the endoscope body is advanced, an electronic motion controller operates the automatically controlled proximal portion to assume the selected curve of the selectively steerable distal portion. Another desired path is selected with the selectively steerable distal portion and the endoscope body is advanced again. As the endoscope body is further advanced, the selected curves propagate proximally along the endoscope body, and when the endoscope body is withdrawn proximally, the selected curves propagate distally along the endoscope body. This creates a serpentine motion in the endoscope body that allows it to negotiate tortuous curves along a desired path through, around, and between organs within the body. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to endoscopes and endoscopic medical procedures. More particularly, it relates to a method and apparatus to facilitate insertion of a flexible endoscope along a tortuous path, such as for colonoscopic examination and treatment. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An endoscope is a medical instrument for visualizing the interior of a patient&apos;s body. Endoscopes can be used for a variety of different diagnostic and interventional procedures, including colonoscopy, bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy, laparoscopy and video endoscopy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Colonoscopy is a medical procedure in which a flexible endoscope, or colonoscope, is inserted into a patient&apos;s colon for diagnostic examination and/or surgical treatment of the colon. A standard colonoscope is typically 135-185 cm in length and 12-13 mm in diameter, and includes a fiberoptic imaging bundle, illumination fibers and one or two instrument channels that may also be used for insufflation or irrigation. The colonoscope is inserted via the patient&apos;s anus and is advanced through the colon, allowing direct visual examination of the colon, the ileocecal valve and portions of the terminal ileum. Insertion of the colonoscope is complicated by the fact that the colon represents a tortuous and convoluted path. Considerable manipulation of the colonoscope is often necessary to advance the colonoscope through the colon, making the procedure more difficult and time consuming and adding to the potential for complications, such as intestinal perforation. Steerable colonoscopes have been devised to facilitate selection of the correct path though the curves of the colon. However, as the colonoscope is inserted farther and farther into the colon, it becomes more difficult to advance the colonoscope along the selected path. At each turn, the wall of the colon Must maintain the curve in the colonoscope. The colonoscope rubs against the mucosal surface of the colon along the outside of each turn. Friction and slack in the colonoscope build up at each turn, making it more and more difficult to advance and withdraw the colonoscope. In addition, the force against the wall of the colon increases with the buildup of friction. In cases of extreme tortuosity, it may become impossible to advance the colonoscope all of the way through the colon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Steerable endoscopes, catheters and insertion devices for medical examination or treatment of internal body structures are described in the following U.S. Pat.

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In keeping with the foregoing discussion, the present invention takes the form of a steerable endoscope for negotiating tortuous paths through a patient&apos;s body. The steerable endoscope can be used for a variety of different diagnostic and interventional procedures, including colonoscopy, bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy, laparoscopy and video endoscopy. The steerable endoscope is particularly well suited for negotiating the tortuous curves encountered when performing a colonoscopy procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The steerable endoscope has an elongated body with a manually or selectively steerable distal portion and an automatically controlled proximal portion. The selectively steerable distal portion can be selectively steered or bent up to a full 180 degree bend in any direction. A fiberoptic imaging bundle and one or more illumination fibers extend through the body from the proximal end to the distal end. Alternatively, the endoscope can be configured as a video endoscope with a miniaturized video camera, such as a CCD camera, which transmits images to a video monitor by a transmission cable or by wireless transmission. Optionally, the endoscope may include one or two instrument channels that may also be used for insufflation or irrigation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A proximal handle attached to the elongate body includes an ocular for direct viewing and/or for connection to a video camera, a connection to an illumination source and one or more luer lock fittings that are connected to the instrument channels. The handle is connected to a steering control for selectively steering or bending the selectively steerable distal portion in the desired direction and to an electronic motion controller for controlling the automatically controlled proximal portion of the endoscope. An axial motion transducer is provided to measure the axial motion of the endoscope body as it is advanced and withdrawn. Optionally, the endoscope may include a motor or linear actuator for automatically advancing and withdrawing the endoscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention involves inserting the distal end of the endoscope body into a patient, either through a natural orifice or through an incision, and steering the selectively steerable distal portion to select a desired path. When the endoscope body is advanced, the electronic motion controller operates the automatically controlled proximal portion of the body to assume the selected curve of the selectively steerable distal portion. This process <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> repeated by selecting another desired path with the selectively steerable distal portion and advancing the endoscope body again. As the endoscope body is further advanced, the selected curves propagate proximally along the endoscope body. Similarly, when the endoscope body is withdrawn proximally, the selected curves propagate distally along the endoscope body. This creates a sort of serpentine motion in the endoscope body that allows it to negotiate tortuous curves along a desired path through or around and between organs within the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The method can be used for performing colonoscopy or other endoscopic procedures, such as bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy, laparoscopy and video endoscopy. In addition, the apparatus and methods of the present invention can be used for inserting other types of instruments, such as surgical instruments, catheters or introducers, along a desired path within the body. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a prior art colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> being employed for a colonoscopic examination of a patient&apos;s colon C. The colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> has a proximal handle <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and an elongate body <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> with a steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The body <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> has been lubricated and inserted into the colon C via the patient&apos;s anus A. Utilizing the steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> for guidance, the body <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> has been maneuvered through several turns in the patient&apos;s colon C to the ascending colon G. Typically, this involves a considerable amount of manipulation by pushing, pulling and rotating the colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> from the proximal end to advance it through the turns of the colon C. After the steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> has passed, the wall of the colon C maintains the curve in the flexible body <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> as it is advanced. Friction develops along the body <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> as it is inserted, particularly at each turn in the colon C. Because of the friction, when the user attempts to advance the colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, the body <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&prime; tends to move outward at each curve, pushing against the wall of the colon C, which exacerbates the problem by increasing the friction and making it more difficult to advance the colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when the colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is withdrawn, the body <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>&Prime; tends to move inward at each curve taking up the slack that developed when the colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> was advanced. When the patient&apos;s colon C is extremely tortuous, the distal end of the body <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> becomes unresponsive to the user&apos;s manipulations, and eventually it may become impossible to advance the colonoscope <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> any farther. In addition to the difficulty that it presents to the user, tortuosity of the patient&apos;s colon also increases the risk of complications, such as intestinal perforation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a first embodiment of the steerable endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has an elongate body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with a manually or selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and an automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be selectively steered or bent up to a full 180 degree bend in any direction. A fiberoptic imaging bundle <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and one or more illumination fibers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> extend through the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the proximal end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the distal end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be configured as a video endoscope with a miniaturized video camera, such as a CCD camera, positioned at the distal end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The images from the video camera can be transmitted to a video monitor by a transmission cable or by wireless transmission. Optionally, the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include one or two instrument channels <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that may also be used for insufflation or irrigation. The body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is highly flexible so that it is able to bend around small diameter curves without buckling or kinking. When configured for use as a colonoscope, the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is typically from 135 to 185 cm in length and approximately 12-13 mm in diameter. The endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be made in a variety of other sizes and configurations for other medical and industrial applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A proximal handle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is attached to the proximal end <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the elongate body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The handle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes an ocular <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> connected to the fiberoptic imaging bundle <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for direct viewing and/or for connection to a video camera <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The handle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected to an illumination source <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> by an illumination cable <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> that is connected to or continuous with the illumination fibers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. A first luer lock fitting, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a second luer lock fitting <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> on the handle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are connected to the instrument channels <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The handle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected to an electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by way of a controller cable <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. A steering control <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is connected to the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by way of a second cable <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> M. The steering control <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> allows the user to selectively steer or bend the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the desired direction. The steering control <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may be a joystick controller as shown, or other known steering control mechanism. The electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> controls the motion of the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be implemented using a motion control program running on a microcomputer or using an application-specific motion controller. Alternatively, the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be implemented using, a neural network controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is provided to measure the axial motion of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as it is advanced and withdrawn. The axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be made in many possible configurations. By way of example, the axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is configured as a ring <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that surrounds the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is attached to a fixed point of reference, such as the surgical table or the insertion point for the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on the patient&apos;s body. As the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> slides through the axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, it produces a signal indicative of the axial position of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with respect to the fixed point of reference and sends a signal to the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by telemetry or by a cable (not shown). The axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may use optical, electronic or mechanical means to measure the axial position of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Other possible configurations for the axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a second embodiment of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention. As in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has an elongate body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with a selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and an automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The steering control <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is integrated into proximal handle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the form or one or two dials for selectively steering, the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Optionally, the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be miniaturized and integrated into proximal handle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, as well. In this embodiment, the axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is configured with a base <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> that is attachable to a fixed point of reference, such as the surgical table. A first roller <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and a second roller <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> contact the exterior of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A multi-turn potentiometer <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> or other motion transducer is connected to the first roller <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> to measure the axial motion of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and to produce a signal indicative of the axial position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be manually advanced or withdrawn by the user by grasping the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> distal to the axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the first roller <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and/or second roller <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> may be connected to a motor <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> for automatically advancing and withdrawing the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a fourth embodiment of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention, which utilizes a rotary housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to organize and contain the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> has a base <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> with a rotating drum <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> to guide the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may have an axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; that is configured as a potentiometer connected to the pivot axis <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of the rotating drum <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may have an axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>&Prime; configured similarly to the axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be manually advanced or withdrawn by the user by grasping the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> distal to the housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may include a motor <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> connected to the rotating drum <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> for automatically advancing and withdrawing the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In another alternative configuration, a motor with friction wheels, similar to that described above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, may be integrated into the axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a wire frame model of a section of the body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a neutral or straight position. Most of the internal structure of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has been eliminated in this drawing for the sake of clarity. The endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is divided up into sections <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> . . . <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, etc. The geometry of each section is defined by four length measurements along the a, b, c and d axes. For example, the geometry of section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is defined by the four length measurements l<highlight><subscript>1a</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>1b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>1c</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>1d</subscript></highlight>, and the geometry of section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is defined by the four length measurements l<highlight><subscript>2a</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>2b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>2c</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>2d</subscript></highlight>, ect. Preferably, each of the length measurements is individually controlled by a linear actuator (not shown). The linear actuators may utilize one of several different operating principles. For example, each of the linear actuators may be a self-heating NiTi alloy linear actuator or an electrorheological plastic actuator, or other known mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic or electromechanical actuator. The geometry of each section may be altered using the linear actuators to change the four length measurements along the a, b, c and d axes. Preferably, the length measurements are changed in complementary pairs to selectively bend the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in a desired direction. For example, to bend the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the direction of the a axis, the measurements l<highlight><subscript>1a</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>2a</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>3a </subscript></highlight>. . . l<highlight><subscript>10a </subscript></highlight>would be shortened and the measurements l<highlight><subscript>1b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>2b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>3b </subscript></highlight>. . . l<highlight><subscript>10b </subscript></highlight>would be lengthened an equal amount. The amount by which these measurements are changed determines the radius of the resultant curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the linear actuators that control the a, b, c and d axis measurements of each section are selectively controlled by the user through the steering control <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Thus, by appropriate control of the a, b, c and d axis measurements, the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be selectively steered or bent up to a full <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> degrees in any direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, however, the a, b, c and d axis measurements of each section are automatically controlled by the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which uses a curve propagation method to control the shape of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. To explain how the curve propagation method operates, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the wire frame model of a part of the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> passing, through a curve in a patient&apos;s colon C. For simplicity, an example of a two-dimensional curve is shown and only the a and b axes will be considered. In a three-dimensional curve all four of the a, b, c and d axes would be brought into play. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has been maneuvered through the curve in the colon C with the benefit of the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (this part of the procedure is explained in more detail below) and now the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> resides in the curve. Sections <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are in a relatively straight part of the colon C, therefore l<highlight><subscript>1a</subscript></highlight>&equals;l<highlight><subscript>1b </subscript></highlight>and l<highlight><subscript>2a</subscript></highlight>&equals;l<highlight><subscript>2b</subscript></highlight>. However, because sections <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are in the S-shaped curved section, l<highlight><subscript>3a</subscript></highlight>&lt;l<highlight><subscript>3b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>4a</subscript></highlight>&lt;l<highlight><subscript>4b </subscript></highlight>and l<highlight><subscript>5a</subscript></highlight>&gt;l<highlight><subscript>5b</subscript></highlight>, but l<highlight><subscript>6a</subscript></highlight>&gt;l<highlight><subscript>6b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>7a</subscript></highlight>&gt;l<highlight><subscript>7b </subscript></highlight>and l<highlight><subscript>8a</subscript></highlight>&gt;l<highlight><subscript>8b</subscript></highlight>. When the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced distally by one unit, section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> moves into the position marked <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> moves into the position previously occupied by section <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, section <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> moves into the position previously occupied by section <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, etc. The axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> produces a signal indicative of the axial position of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with respect to a fixed point of reference and sends the signal to the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, Under control of the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, each time the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> advances one unit, each section in the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is signaled to assume the shape of the section that previously occupied the space that it is now in. Therefore, when the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced to the position marked <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, l<highlight><subscript>1a</subscript></highlight>&equals;l<highlight><subscript>1b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>2a</subscript></highlight>&equals;l<highlight><subscript>2b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>3a</subscript></highlight>&equals;l<highlight><subscript>3b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>4a</subscript></highlight>&lt;l<highlight><subscript>4b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>5a</subscript></highlight>&lt;l<highlight><subscript>5b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>6a</subscript></highlight>&lt;l<highlight><subscript>6b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>7a</subscript></highlight>&gt;l<highlight><subscript>7b </subscript></highlight>and l<highlight><subscript>8a</subscript></highlight>&gt;l<highlight><subscript>8b</subscript></highlight>, and l<highlight><subscript>9a</subscript></highlight>&gt;l<highlight><subscript>9b</subscript></highlight>, when the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced to the position marked <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&Prime;, l<highlight><subscript>1a</subscript></highlight>&equals;l<highlight><subscript>1b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>2a</subscript></highlight>&equals;l<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>3a</subscript></highlight>&equals;l<highlight><subscript>3b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>4a</subscript></highlight>&equals;l<highlight><subscript>4b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>5a</subscript></highlight>&lt;l<highlight><subscript>5b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>6a</subscript></highlight>&lt;l<highlight><subscript>6b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>7a</subscript></highlight>&lt;l<highlight><subscript>7b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>8a</subscript></highlight>&gt;l<highlight><subscript>8b</subscript></highlight>, l<highlight><subscript>9a</subscript></highlight>&gt;l<highlight><subscript>9b</subscript></highlight>, and l<highlight><subscript>10a</subscript></highlight>&gt;l<highlight><subscript>10b</subscript></highlight>. Thus, the S-shaped curve propagates proximally along the length of the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The S-shaped curve appears to be fixed in space, as the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> advances distally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Similarly, when the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is withdrawn proximally, each time the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is moved proximally by one unit, each section in the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is signaled to assume the shape of the section that previously occupied the space that it is now in. The S-shaped curve propagates distally along the length of the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the S-shaped curve appears to be fixed in space, as the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> withdraws proximally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Whenever the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced or withdrawn, the axial motion transducer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> detects the change in position and the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> propagates the selected curves proximally or distally along the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to maintain the curves in a spatially fixed position. This allows the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to move through tortuous curves without putting unnecessary force on the wall of the colon C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> show the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention being employed for a colonoscopic examination of a patient&apos;s colon. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has been lubricated and inserted into the patient&apos;s colon C through the anus A. The distal end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced through the rectum R until the first turn in the colon C is reached, as observed through the ocular <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> or on a video monitor. To negotiate the turn, the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is manually steered toward the sigmoid colon S by the user through the steering control <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The control signals from the steering control <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are monitored b the electronic y motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. When the correct curve of the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for advancing the distal end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> into the sigmoid colon S has been selected, the curve is logged into the memory of the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as a reference. This step can be performed in a manual mode, in which the user gives a command to the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to record the selected curve, using keyboard commands or voice commands. Alternatively, this step can be performed in an automatic mode, in which the user signals to the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> that the desired curve has been selected by advancing the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> distally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Whether operated in manual mode or automatic mode; once the desired curve has been selected with the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced distally and the selected curve is propagated proximally along the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, as described above. The curve remains fixed in space while the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced distally through the sigmoid colon S. In a particularly tortuous colon, the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may have to be steered through multiple curves to traverse the sigmoid colon S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the user may stop the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at any point for examination or treatment of the mucosal surface or any other features within the colon C. The selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be steered in any direction to examine the inside of the colon C. When the user has completed the examination of the sigmoid colon S, the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is steered in a superior direction toward the descending colon D. Once the desired curve has been selected with the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced distally into the descending colon D, and the second curve as well as the first curve are propagated proximally along the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If, at any time, the user decides that the path taken by the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> needs to be revised or corrected, the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be withdrawn proximally and the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> commanded to erase the previously selected curve. This can be done manually using keyboard commands or voice commands or automatically by programming the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to go into a revise mode when the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is withdrawn a certain distance. The revised or corrected curve is selected using the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced as described before. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced through the descending colon D until it reaches the left (splenic) flexure F<highlight><subscript>l </subscript></highlight>of the colon. Here, in many cases, the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> must negotiate an almost 180 degree hairpin turn. As before, the desired curve is selected using the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced distally through the transverse colon T, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Each of the previously selected curves is propagated proximally along the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The same procedure is followed at the right (hepatic) flexure F<highlight><subscript>r </subscript></highlight>of the colon and the distal end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is advanced through the ascending colon G to the cecum E, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The cecum E, the ileocecal valve V and the terminal portion of the ileum I can be examined from this point using, the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> being, withdrawn through the colon C. As the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is withdrawn, the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> follows the previously selected curves by propagating the curves distally along the automatically controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, as described above. At any point, the user may stop the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for examination or treatment of the mucosal surface or any other features within the colon C using the selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In one preferred method according to the present invention, the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes an electronic memory in which is created a three-dimensional mathematical model of the patient&apos;s colon or other anatomy through which the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is maneuvered. The three-dimensional model can be annotated by the operator to record the location of anatomical landmarks, lesions, polyps, biopsy samples and other features of interest. The three-dimensional model of the patient&apos;s anatomy can be used to facilitate reinsertion of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in subsequent procedures. In addition, the annotations can be used to quickly find the location of the features of interest. For example, the three-dimensional model can be annotated with the location where a biopsy sample was taken during an exploratory endoscopy. The site of the biopsy sample can be reliably located again in follow-up procedures to track the progress of a potential disease process and/or to perform a therapeutic procedure at the site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In one particularly preferred variation of this method, the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can-be programmed, based on the three-dimensional model in the electronic memory, so that the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will automatically assume the proper shape to follow the desired path as it is advanced through the patient&apos;s anatomy. In embodiments of the steerable endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that are configured for automatically advancing and withdrawing the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, as described above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be commanded to advance automatically though the patient&apos;s anatomy to the site of a previously noted lesion or other point of interest based on the three-dimensional model in the electronic memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Imaging software would allow the three-dimensional model of the patient&apos;s anatomy obtained using the steerable endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to be viewed on a computer monitor or the like. This would facilitate comparisons between the three-dimensional model and images obtained with other imaging modalities, for example fluoroscopy, radiography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT scan), electron beam tomography or virtual colonoscopy. Conversely, images from these other imaging modalities can be used to map out an approximate path or trajectory to facilitate insertion of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In addition, images from other imaging modalities can be used to facilitate locating suspected lesions with the steerable endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, images obtained using a barium-contrast radiograph of the colon can be used to map out an approximate path to facilitate insertion of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> into the patient&apos;s colon. The location and depth of any suspected lesions seen on the radiograph can be noted so that the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be quickly and reliably guided to the vicinity of the lesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Imaging modalities that provide three-dimensional information, such as biplanar fluoroscopy, CT or MRI, can be used to program the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> so that the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will automatically assume the proper shape to follow the desired path as it is advanced through the patient&apos;s anatomy. In embodiments of the steerable endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that are configured for automatically advancing and withdrawing the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be commanded to advance automatically though the patient&apos;s anatomy along the desired path as determined by the three-dimensional imacrinc, information. Similarly, the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be commanded to advance automatically to the site of a suspected lesion or other point of interest noted on the images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Although the endoscope of the present invention has been described for use as a colonoscope, the endoscope can be configured for a number of other medical and industrial applications. In addition, the present invention can also be configured as a catheter, cannula, surgical instrument or introducer sheath that uses the principles of the invention for navigating through tortuous body channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In a variation of the method that is particularly applicable to laparoscopy or thoracoscopy procedures, the steerable endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be selectively maneuvered along a desired path around and between organs in a patient&apos;s body cavity. The distal end <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the endoscope <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is g inserted into the patient&apos;s body cavity through a natural opening, through a surgical incision or through a surgical cannula or introducer. The selectively steerable distal portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be used to explore and examine the patient&apos;s body cavity and to select a path around and between the patient&apos;s organs. The electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be used to control the automatic ally controlled proximal portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the endoscope body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to follow the selected path and, if necessary, to return to a desired location using the three-dimensional model in the electronic memory of the electronic motion controller <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described herein with respect to the exemplary embodiments and the best mode for practicing the invention, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that man modifications, improvements and subcombinations of the various embodiments, adaptations and variations can be made to the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. </paragraph>
