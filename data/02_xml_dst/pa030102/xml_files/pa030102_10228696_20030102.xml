<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to portable computer systems, and in particular to the management of performance and power consumption in a portable computer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Portable computer systems have always lagged their desktop counterpart personal computers in speed and overall performance due to the limited power available in current batteries. Because the latest and fastest computer components, such as processors consume more power and generate more heat than lower speed components, they are not normally used in portable computer systems such as laptop computers. The use of high speed central processing units (CPUs) requires higher clock speed and higher voltages than current CPUs used for portable computer systems because the higher clock speed and higher operating voltage results in more power being consumed and thus heat being generated. The cooling of such components requires greater power, or larger heat sinks, which is readily available in larger desktop type computer systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Due to space constraints, thermal considerations and limited battery life, some portable computers employ various power management methods to reduce generation of heat while operating on battery power such that fans are not activated. Such methods include the reduction of the speed of the processor. When AC power is provided, the processor may run at higher speed and/or higher voltage, however, the cooling capability may not be sufficient to properly cool a portable computer using the current fastest processors and other components. Either there is not sufficient room for a large enough heat sink for the processor, or a large enough fan would consume so much power that the battery would not last long enough to meet current user expectations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There is a need for a portable computer which can utilize the faster processors that generate more heat than can currently be dissipated by portable computers. There is a further need to operate such processors at higher speed at selected times. There is yet a further need to provide such abilities without using larger heat sinks or other solutions that would increase the size and or weight of such portable computers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A portable computer receives additional cooling capabilities from an external docking station. The portable computer detects such cooling capacity and modifies its performance. In one embodiment, the portable computer system has a case with openings placed in alignment with mating openings in a docking station which provides additional active cooling capacity. The portable computer system case also has further openings and a defined air flow path to enhance airflow across a processor to cool it more effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the active cooling provided by the docking station is a fan, or other device which pulls or pushes air from or into the portable computer system case. The mating openings and further openings in the computer system case are positioned to optimize the cooling effectiveness of the air flow with respect to the processor and other heat producing components. Further active cooling apparatus include a compressor coupled to refrigeration coils positioned beneath the portable computer, and other devices which provide active cooling such as by refrigeration or sound and diaphragm combinations. Still further embodiments utilize heat pipes positioned proximate the processor of the portable computer and functioning to transfer heat to the docking station where active heat transfer is provided. Yet further embodiments utilize extruded aluminum slugs to transfer heat from the bottom of the portable computer to the active cooling mechanism provided in the docking station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, power management functions of the computer system are alerted that the portable computer has been docked with the docking station. Once alerted, the power management functions allow the processor to operate at higher speed, relying on the extra cooling capacity provided by the docking station to properly cool the processor. In a further embodiment, the power management functions simply rely on temperature sensing to control the processor speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The extra cooling capacity provided by the docking station then allows the processor to run indefinitely at higher speed. The extra cooling capacity may also provide the ability to utilize faster, more expensive processors which generate more heat without sacrificing the power of the processor when docked. It further enhances the ability to obtain desktop performance from a docked portable computer, while retaining the ability to slow the CPU speed, and/or operating voltage to obtain longer battery life when undocked.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limited sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A portable computer system is indicated generally at <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> coupled to a docking station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The portable computer system has a display device <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (indicated in broken line form) rotatably coupled to one end of a portable computer system case <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the portable computer system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is a Gateway 2000, Inc Solo&reg; having a keyboard <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, a touchpad <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, speakers <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and other commonly provided accessibly computer peripheral and connectors. The case <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is shown in cutaway form to expose a processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as a heat sink <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> mounted thereon with fins <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to help dissipate heat when cooling is effected in both a passive mode, or an active mode. Thus, the need for a fan located within the computer system case <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is either eliminated, or a smaller fan may be employed as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is mounted in the case <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> proximate a plurality of mating openings <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The mating openings <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> mate with counterpart openings in a case of the docking station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> which contains a fan <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> mounted therein for drawing or moving air from the computer system case <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> through mating openings <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to help cool the processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The docking station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> also contains a power supply for providing additional power to allow the portable computer system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to operate at higher voltages and/or amperages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Air intake openings <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> are indicated in the top of case <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and positioned to one side of the processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Air is drawn in through intake openings <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> as represented by lines <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. The air is then drawn through the fins <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of heat sink <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> as represented by line <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> and out through the mating openings <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, through the docking station as represented by lines <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and out of the docking station past the fan <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as indicated by lines <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in the past has been mounted on an aluminum backing plate for keyboard <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which acts as a heat sink. In the present invention, the processor is mounted in such a manner as to enable outside air to be drawn past it and then into the docking station through the mating openings <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. While shown in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as residing near the back of the case, proximate the docking station, and between the air intake openings <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and mating openings <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, it will be recognized that it could be positioned otherwise within the portable computer case <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> while still obtaining the same cooling effects, provided that the air intake and mating openings are also repositioned proximate the processor, or in a position to help create a well defined airflow past the processor heat sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Further air intake openings are optionally provided on a front edge of the computer case as indicated at <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> for drawing in air as represented by lines <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Air intake openings may be positioned wherever desired, resulting in airflow operating to cool other components which generate undesired heat, as represented by airflow line <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> rear elevation view of portable computer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shown with a first set of mating openings <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and second set of mating openings <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> located on either side of a docking electrical connector <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> which comprises a PCI bus in one embodiment, but may also be infrared or other electromagnetic communication device. A separate switch <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is also located in a position on the rear of the portable computer to come into contact with a corresponding switch contact <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> on the docking station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. These switches are well known in the art, and may take many different forms, from mechanically actuated to electrically actuated. The switch <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is coupled in a known manner to provide an indication to power management software running on processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that the portable computer is docked, and receiving additional cooling capacity. The switch or contact <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is coupled to the docking station power supply and may be used to automatically initiate the provision of AC power and turn on fan <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to provide cooling. It may also just be a plastic projection that actuates switch <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> to indicate that the docking station has been successfully coupled to the portable computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A front view of docking station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also comprises mating openings <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> formed in the docking station case which mate with openings <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> on the computer case <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and also comprises openings <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> which mate with openings <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. A further plurality of openings <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> are provided proximate the fan <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to provide for the exit of air drawn in from the portable computer. Further, a female connector <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> mates with a male connector <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> on the computer case to provide communications between the computer and the docking station. Docking station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> further comprises a switch <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to indicate successful coupling to the portable computer. Many docking stations or docking bars provide AC power and further peripheral devices such as disk drives and network cards, all as represented by docking station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a portable computer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> having an alternative positioning of mating openings indicated at <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Openings <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> comprise circular holes formed in the case, either as the case is molded, or after the case is formed the openings are formed as by drilling. Further openings <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> are oval or elongated circles as shown to provide for even greater airflow. Openings <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> are located near the bottom of the back side of the computer case. Since the processor is also located near the bottom of the computer case, more air is likely to be directed through the fins of the heat sink, providing even better cooling. While these openings are shown off to one side of the case, they could be located anywhere along the back side of the case depending on the placement of the processor and the air intake holes. Both of these sets of openings are designed to mate with similar openings shown at <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> of and alternative docking station indicated at <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Further, larger, elongated openings are shown at <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> for the exhaustion of air from the docking station <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the types of openings may easily be modified by one of average skill in the art to many different shapes to obtain desired airflow characteristics. With the openings located toward one side of the computer as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the placement of the air intake openings and the processor heat sink will also need to modified. In one embodiment, the fins of the heat sink may be placed so that the run from the front to the back of the computer, at right angles from that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The fins could also be placed to encourage direct airflow between the intake and exhaust (mating) openings. In this case, the fins may be placed at any angle relative to the case of the computer. The placement of openings and the processor may be dictated by the need to place many components inside of a limited space case. Thus, the freedom to modify the angle or orientation of the fins provides more design freedom in locating such other components while still maintain the advantages provided by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> represents yet a further embodiment of the invention wherein air intake openings <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> are provided on a side of a computer case <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. This placement of intake openings provides more freedom in the use of the portable computer when docked. Many times, a display <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> of the portable computer does not have the quality and ease of viewing associated with large screen CRT displays which are often provided by with docking stations. In the event that such a CRT display is being used, the display <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> of the portable may be in a locked down position, which could block the flow of air in through intake openings <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Providing air intake openings <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> on the side of the computer case <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> reduces such a problem. It may also allow for more air to flow evenly across the fins of the heat sink, since the air will be following more of a straight path from the side rather than from the top. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, present power management systems of portable computers slow down the processor to avoid excess generation of heat by the processor which cannot be effectively dissipated. An improved power management system is represented by the flowchart represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The flowchart is representative of code modules or a module running on the processor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or other electronic device or machine as desired, and may be hardcoded, hardwired, or written in software and stored on machine readable media such as RAM, CDROM, or disk drive to name but a few. It may also be received via network and run directly from the network. The flowchart is entered at <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> upon power up of the portable computer. At <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, the normal power management functions are run, which result in processor speeds being cut and hence performance reduced. At decision block <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, an interrupt resulting from the docking switch <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> being triggered indicates that docking as been detected. In one embodiment, the docking switch is sensitive to only a docking station which provides additional cooling functionality. If no docking has been detected, the normal standalone power management is continued. However, if docking is detected, the power management system runs the processor at higher speed or cycle time at <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> relying of sufficient cooling being provided by the docking station or docking bar. If undocking is detected at <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, again as indicated by the switch <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, standalone power management is reentered at <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. In further embodiments, the power management systems also decrease the operating voltage with decreases in operating speed. This further decreases the power consumed in power conservation modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> further alternative embodiment of a docking station <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> provides active cooling by means of refrigerative cooling. In a cutaway portion of a base support <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> of the docking station <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> corresponding to where a portable computer would rest when engaged with the docking station, a cooling coil is shown at <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>. The cooling coil may be filled with any type of fluid, such as water or gas, or common refrigerant to provide cooling for the portable computer. A compressor is shown at <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> which is coupled to the coil <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> in a common manner.

The fins are then actively cooled by fan or other cooling device <highlight><bold>936</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In a still further alternative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> docking station <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> provides active cooling for a portable computer <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> by the use of heat pipes. A central processing unit CPU <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> is located in the portable computer thermally coupled proximate a first heat pipe <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight>. The first heat pipe is coupled via an aluminum collar <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> mounted on the docking station <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> to second heat pipe <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> which may be fanned out into cooling fins at <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> for cooling by an active cooling mechanism such as a fan <highlight><bold>1026</bold></highlight> positioned proximate the heat pipe within the docking station. In a variation, the heat pipe <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight> is coupled to a heat sink or other heat transfer mechanism in the docking station in place of the heat pipe and actively cooled by any of the previous methods described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description. For instance, the location of mating holes or openings along with the placement of the processor and the placement or orientation of the heat sink on the processor may be modified as desired or needed due to design constraints. Further, temperature sensors may be used to determine the speed at which the processor runs as opposed to the use of switches or other means. Further, the switches may be incorporated into the electrical connector, or simply be coupled to one of the connectors to determine if the impedance or other detectable characteristic of the connector has changed, indicating that the portable computer is coupled to a docking station or other type of device which provides both more power and active cooling capabilities. Moreover, the air flow may be modified such that the docking station moves air into the portable computer as opposed to only drawing air from it. The docking station also provides a common power supply, which when combined with the increased cooling abilities enables the computer to operate at higher voltages and/or amperages, which can increase the performance of the computer system. While a docking station is described, it should be clear that other types of devices that provide cooling may also be used although not normally referred to as a docking station. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. </paragraph>
