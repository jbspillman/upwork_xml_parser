<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for coating a substrate, and more particularly to an apparatus and method for impregnating monolithic substrates with a catalytic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Catalytic converters are well known for the removal and/or conversion of the harmful components of exhaust gases. Catalytic converters have a variety of constructions for this purpose. In one form the converter comprises the rigid skeletal monolithic substrate on which there is a catalytic coating. The monolith has a honeycomb-type structure which has a multiplicity of longitudinal channels, typically in parallel, to provide a catalytically coated body having a high surface area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The rigid, monolithic substrate can be fabricated from ceramics and other materials. Such materials and their construction are described, for example, in U.S. Pat Nos. 3,331,787 and 3,565,830 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the monoliths can be fabricated from metal foil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The monolithic substrate and particularly the multiplicity of channels can be coated with a slurry of a catalytic and/or absorbent material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One method of coating a prefabricated monolithic substrate is to pump the catalyst slurry into the respective channels and then subject the coated substrate to a drying operation. Such systems have been unsuccessful in providing a uniform coating thickness and a uniform coating profile wherein the catalyst coating is deposited over the same length of each of the channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It has been proposed to employ a vacuum to draw the catalyst slurry upwardly through the channels. For example, Peter D. Young, U.S. Pat. No. 4,384,014 discloses the creation of a vacuum over the monolithic substrate to remove air from the channels and then drawing the catalyst slurry upwardly through the channels. The vacuum is then broken and excess slurry is removed, preferably by gravity drainage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> James R. Reed, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,191,126, discloses the dipping of the monolithic substrate into a slurry and then utilizing subatmospheric pressure to purge the excess coating slurry from the surfaces of the support. The applied vacuum is intended to unplug the channels so that the slurry is drawn over the surfaces of each of the channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An improvement in these systems is disclosed in Thomas Shimrock. et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,609,563. This system encompasses a method of vacuum coating ceramic substrate members with a slurry of refractory and/or catalyst metal components wherein precisely controlled, predetermined amounts of the slurry are metered for application to the ceramic monolithic substrate. The monolithic substrate is lowered into a vessel, also known as a dip pan, of preferably predetermined dimensions to a predetermined depth containing the precise amount of slurry which is to be coated onto the substrate. The slurry is then drawn up by a vacuum which is applied to the end of the substrate opposite to the end which is immersed in the bath. No draining or purging of excess coating slurry from the substrate is necessary nor is any pre-vacuum application step required to eliminate air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further improved method is disclosed Victor Rosynsky et al, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,210 entitled, &ldquo;METHOD FOR COATING A SUBSTRATE.&rdquo; There is disclosed a vacuum infusion method for coating monolithic substrates in which each of the channels comprising the substrate is coated with the same thickness of the coating and is characterized by a uniform coating profile wherein each channel of the substrate is coated over the same length. In particular, the method is directed to a vacuum infusion method for coating a substrate having a plurality of channels with a coating media comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> a) partially immersing the substrate into a vessel containing a bath of the coating media, said vessel containing an amount of coating media sufficient to coat the substrate to a desired level without reducing the level of the coating media within the vessel to below the level of the immersed substrate; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> b) applying a vacuum to the partially immersed substrate at an intensity and a time sufficient to draw the coating media upwardly from the bath into each of the channels to form a uniform coating profile therein; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> c) removing the substrate from the bath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Optionally, after the coating media is applied to the substrate and as the substrate is being removed from the bath, a vacuum continues to be applied to the substrate at an intensity equal to or greater than the intensity of the vacuum imposed on the partially immersed substrate. After the vacuum is imposed, the substrate is inverted and coated from an opposite end producing two coatings having uniform coating profiles. This procedure is known to reduce the overlap of the coating media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Overlap of the coating compound is particularly problematic to the automobile industry. The overlap area increases the delta pressure across the catalyst converter which adversely impacts engine performance and fuel consumption and increases the engine&apos;s wear. Equally problematic is where the coating compound has a gap in the middle which results from incomplete coverage during the coating procedure. This, too, may adversely affect converter and engine performance. However, where the substrate is inverted in order to coat both ends, it is extremely difficult to ensure that the coating materials will not overlap or gap to some extent. Even the smallest amount of overlap or gap negatively affects catalytic performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It would therefore be a significant benefit in the art of coating monolithic substrates and particularly monolithic substrates for use in catalytic converters if each channel can be coated with the same thickness of coating for the same length without any overlap or gap in the coating materials. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a system for applying a catalyst composition to an interior of a hollow substrate which eliminates the overlap or gap of the coating slurry. Generally stated, the system comprises coating a substrate with a catalyst composition by immersing the substrate into a vessel containing a bath of coating slurry and applying a vacuum to the partially immersed substrate at an intensity and time sufficient to draw the coating slurry upwardly from the bath into each of a plurality of channels located in the interior of the hollow substrate; removing the substrate from the bath: rotating the substrate 180&deg;; and applying a blast of pressurized air to the substrate at an intensity and time sufficient to distribute the coating slurry within the channels of the substrate to form a uniform coating profile therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;uniform coating profile&rdquo; as used herein means that each channel of the substrate will be coated over the same length. Advantageously, the present invention provides a system whereby the overlap or gap of the catalytic composition on the substrate is completely eliminated. This provides distinct advantages for catalytic converters. First, less precious metal may be used because the catalytic composition is evenly distributed throughout the substrate. Second, there is more precise control over the placement of the catalyst which is particularly advantageous when using multiple catalyst coating compositions. Third, by virtue of removing the overlap or gap, the thickness of the coating can be more precisely controlled, particularly in multi coating applications. Resistance to the flow of gases to be treated through the substrate is thereby reduced, resulting in better control over and less severe pressure drops through the channels. When such substrates are used as catalytic converters, engine performance is not diminished. As used herein the term &ldquo;vacuum infusion&rdquo; shall generally mean the imposition of a vacuum to infuse a coating slurry into a plurality of channels within a monolithic substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for applying a catalyst composition to the interior of a hollow substrate comprising coating the interior of a hollow substrate with a predetermined amount of a catalytic composition; rotating the substrate 180&deg;; and applying a blast of air to the substrate to distribute the catalytic composition therewithin. Catalytic converters produced in accordance with the present invention exhibit less wet gain and precious metal variability, resulting in increased production output and less expense incurred from the use of precious metals. Advantageously, automobiles using these materials have reduced fuel consumption because there is much lower pressure drop across the catalyst, than is seen with catalytic converters having an overlap or gap of the catalytic composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides an apparatus for coating a substrate with a catalytic composition. The apparatus comprises a coating station comprising a dip pan containing a continuous supply of a coating slurry, a vacuum cone operatively engaged to apply a vacuum to the substrate, an inflatable bladder clamp for supporting and rotating the substrate and an air blast station for supplying a blast of pressurized air to the substrate. The apparatus may further comprise a movable platform for moving the substrate between stations and a robot for automatically loading and unloading the substrate onto and off of the apparatus. Advantageously, the apparatus is highly automated and efficient, making it less expensive and more reliable to use than prior art apparatus.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an improved system for coating a catalytic composition onto a substrate whereby the catalytic composition is uniformly coated within the interior surface of the substrate. The system of the present invention combines vacuum infusion coating with an air blast apparatus to provide a uniformly coated substrate without gaps or overlap of the catalytic composition within the interior of the substrate. As a consequence of the present invention, production output is increased and less precious metal is required in the catalytic composition, making a higher quality catalysts less expensive to produce. Moreover, automobiles using the catalysts of the present invention exhibit reduced fuel consumption, making these materials much more attractive to the automobile industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the system of the present invention comprises coating a substrate with a catalyst composition by immersing the substrate into a vessel containing a bath of coating slurry and applying a vacuum to the partially immersed substrate at an intensity and time sufficient to draw the coating slurry upwardly from the bath into each of a plurality of channels located in the interior of the hollow substrate; removing the substrate from the bath; rotating the substrate 180&deg;; and applying a blast of pressurized air to the substrate at an intensity and time sufficient to distribute the coating slurry within the channels of the substrate to form a uniform coating profile therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown a schematic diagram of a system embodying the principles of the present invention. Generally stated, a monolithic substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is immersed in a catalytic composition, a low intensity vacuum applied, the substrate is removed from the coating slurry, and a higher intensity vacuum applied. Thereafter, the substrate is rotated 180&deg; and an air blast is applied. This is accomplished by a coating station and an air blast station which may simultaneously coat one, two, or more substrates. The system may be designed to allow a human operator to manually move the substrate between stations, or, alternatively, with a moveable platform which advances the substrate between stations (discussed in more detail below). In this instance, an electrical motor drives the moveable platform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The process of providing the coated catalytic substrate is briefly described as follows: The operator defines system parameters (i.e., depth of immersion of the substrate in the coating slurry, duration and intensity of the vacuum and air blast, length of time at each indexing station. etc.), adjusts the system to conform with the specified parameters and presses a start button on a control panel (not shown). A robot or human operator picks up a hollow substrate which is open at both ends and transfers this to a bladder clamp which inflates to seal the periphery of substrate and hold the substrate in place. The bladder clamp is connected to a platform which serves to move the substrate between different stations within the system. Where a human operator moves the substrate between the stations, each of the different stations has its own bladder clamp to secure the substrate. Assuming that a movable platform is used, the platform advances the inflated bladder clamp to the coating station where the dip pan moves upward to a predetermined height causing the substrate to immerse to a given depth. A low vacuum is applied to draw a slurry up through the interior of the substrate from the dip pan. The substrate is then lifted out of the dip pan, a high vacuum applied, and the substrate rotated 180&deg;. At this point, the substrate and the platform advances to an air blast station where the upper and receiving hood of the air blast station close around the substrate, and a blast of air is applied to the substrate to distribute the coating slurry about the uncoated portions of the substrate. After the air blast, the upper and receiving hoods of the air blast station open and the bladder clamp and the platform advances to a loading/unloading station where the bladder clamp deflates and the substrate is removed from the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> While the overall system is generally illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it can be better understood by referring to a number of stations which make up the entire system. Of course, each of these stations may be adapted with computerized controls to provide for automatic action once the system is initially programmed by an operator. A suitable apparatus for coating substrates in accordance with the present invention is manufactured by MPT Technologies Inc. of Brecksville, Ohio. Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a perspective view of a coating station utilized by the present invention. Generally stated, coating station <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a vacuum which is supplied via vacuum pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a vacuum hood <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is operatively connected to the substrate when the substrate in placed in contact with the coating slurry. A dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> holds continuously circulating coating slurry received from a storage tank for coating the substrate. In accordance with the present invention, an inlet tube provides for the continuous flow of coating slurry from a slurry tank (not shown) to the dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An outlet tube provides for the continuous flow of coating slurry out of the dip pan to a slurry recovery tank (not shown). In this way, the coating slurry may be recovered and recycled back into the dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> thereby reducing the cost associated with furnishing fresh coating slurry into the system. A series of valves may be located on the inlet and outlet tubes to regulate the slurry flow. The coating slurry need not be metered to provide an exact amount of coating slurry to the dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Instead, a continuous flow of coating slurry is provided to the dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is configured with a U-shaped receptacle which is contiguous with the circumference of the dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and functions to catch and direct any slurry overflow to the outlet tube. The dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to a carriage driven by a servo motor which functions to raise and lower the dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along the vertical axis to immerse the substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> therein or remove it therefrom. A computer controls the vertical movement of the dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to control the depth of immersion of the substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the coating slurry to insure an adequate volume <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the coating slurry is supplied to the dip pan to coat the end of the substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> immersed therein. The volume of coating slurry required to coat the substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention is based upon a variety of factors well known in the art including volume of the substrate, required slurry loading, viscosity of the slurry, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The dimensions and shape of the dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be varied over a wide range. A single size and shape dip pan may be used to coat a wide variety of different size and shape monolithic substrates. Thus, the dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is capable of accommodating a rectangular substrate as well as oval, polygon, and circular substrates which may be used from time to time for special applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Where the apparatus utilizes a platform to advance the substrate between stations, the apparatus may further comprise a loading/unloading station. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the loading/unloading station consists of a bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> which has a larger circumference than the substrate. The bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is equipped with an air supply inlet (not shown) which enables the bladder to inflate so that the interior <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> sealingly engages the outside perimeter of a substrate. The bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is also equipped with an air supply outlet that allows the bladder to deflate when necessary. Preferably, the air supply inlet and outlet are the same. Each of these inlets and outlets may be computer control led to permit automatic inflation and deflation of bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is permanently affixed to the moveable platform by suitable means such as screws, pins, clamps, or the like. The bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> serves to move the substrate between the different stations of the apparatus. It is contemplated that any shape and type of bladder clamp may be used so long as it accommodates the shape of the substrate. By use of a bladder clamp, the apparatus can coat any substrate, regardless of shape of size. Of course, the apparatus need not utilize a robot and the associated loading/unloading station. Instead, a human operator can manually move the substrate between the different stations. In an alternative embodiment, the loading and unloading stations may be separate, each having the inflatable bladder clamp described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The bladder clamp is also connected to a rotational device which serves to rotate the substrate 180&deg;. Any rotational device may be used, however, a pneumatically actuated rotational device is preferred. One such example of a preferred rotational device is manufactured by Shunk Corp. of Germany. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A robot may be used to load and unload the substrate to and from the apparatus. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a top view of a robotic arm which may be used in the present invention. Any type of robotic apparatus which is designed to move objects may be used. A particularly suitable robot is sold by Adept Corp. of Cincinnati, Ohio. As can be seen, the robot <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is capable of grasping the substrate and thereby move it via movable arm <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to and from the apparatus. While robot <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown adapted with pinchers <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, any end unit suitable for grasping substrates used for catalytic converters may be used. Robot <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may also be adapted with a vision system which allows robot <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to properly orient the substrate in the loading station. Robot <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may also be used to remove the coated substrate from the apparatus. That is, once the substrate has been coated and subjected to an air blast, the moveable platform advances to the load/unload station where the robot <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> grasps the coated substrate from the bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown a side elevation view of the air blast station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> utilized in the system of the present invention. A suitable unit for performing the air blast in accordance with the present invention is manufactured by MPT Technologies Inc. of Brecksville, Ohio. The air blast station generally includes upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, receiving hood <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, air supply <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, and stationary frame structure <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. Air blast feed <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is connected to the top <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on one end and serves to provide a source of pressurized air to upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The top of air blast feed <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is threadingly engaged with line <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The top <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is also connected to carriage <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> for movement along rod <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> on the vertical or Z axis. Carriage <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, is in turn, coupled to stationary frame structure <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. A servo motor (not shown) appropriately drives carriage <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> up and down along the vertical axis which operate to open and close upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and attached air blast feed <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Line <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, which may be made of any suitable material to carry pressurized air, runs between the air blast feed <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and air supply <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Receiving hood <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive the substrate. Slurry discharge tube <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> extends from an aperture <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> positioned at the bottom of receiving hood <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. On the opposite end, slurry discharge tube <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is coupled to an aperture <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> positioned on the top of slurry recovery tank <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. Slurry recovery tank <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> may be connected to slurry tank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the coating station via piping and an optional servo motor connected to the system to drive the used catalytic composition from slurry recovery tank <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> to recovery tank <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for reuse in the system. Receiving hood <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is coupled to a carriage (not shown) which provides for movement of receiving hood <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in the vertical or Z direction when driven by a servo motor to open and close the receiving hood. In the closed position, upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> sealingly engages one side of bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the receiving hood <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> sealingly engage with the other side of bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to form a seal which can contain, as discussed below, filled with pressurized air from air supply <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. In the open position, upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is sufficiently distanced from receiving hood <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to allow for loading or unloading of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Air supply <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is contained within a tank, typically made of metal, plastic or other material suitable to hold pressurized air. The tank may be refillable, that is, it may be exchanged for a new tank when the contents have been used, or it may be connected to another air supply which provides the air for refill in air supply <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. An adjustable regulator (not shown) is attached to air blast station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in order to adjust the pressure in air supply <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. As previously mentioned, line <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> connects air supply <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> with air blast feed <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and thereby provides a passageway for air to travel from air supply <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> to upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A normally open feed valve <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is suitably mounted on air supply <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and operates on line <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to regulate the flow of air into air blast feed <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Thus, when a substrate is placed on receiving hood <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is closed to sealingly engage receiving hood <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, air supply <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> provides a regulated air supply via valve <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and line <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to air blast feed <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> which, in turn, provides a pressurized air to the cavity formed when upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is in the closed position. This pressurized blast of air serves to uniformly distribute the coating material throughout in the interior of the substrate and &ldquo;blow off&rdquo; the excess. The excess coating slurry enters slurry recovery tank <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> by way of gravity feed from slurry discharge tube <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> via aperture <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a front elevational view of an air blast station in accordance with the present invention adapted to simultaneously receive and provide a blast of air to two coated substrates. In this illustration, an upper hood is represented by <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, receiving hood by <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, stationary frame structure by <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>, and air blast feed and its associated carriage as <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, respectively. Line <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> connects air blast feed <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> to the air supply (not shown). Excess coating slurry, which has been &ldquo;blown off&rdquo; the substrate after the air blast is captured by slurry recovery tank <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> via slurry discharge tube <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The apparatus may also be equipped with weighing stations for weighing the substrate before coating and after the air blast. By weighing the substrate before and after coating, the percentage of wet gain variability, that is the uniformity of the coating process, can be determined. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> provides a top view of a five-station automatic apparatus in accordance with the present invention with loading/unloading station <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, weigh station <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, coating station <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, air blast station <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and weigh station <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a weigh station used for simultaneous weighing of two substrates in accordance with the present invention. Generally stated, the weigh station is configured so that when the moveable platform advances to the station, the bladder clamp deflates. Below the platform is positioned a unit containing scale <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and a servo motor <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> supported by stationary frame <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> which operates via rod <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> to raise and lower the scale in a vertical direction along the Y axis. When scale <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is raised upward, it touches the bottom of the substrate, enabling weighing of the uncoated or coated substrate. After performing weight calculations, scale <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> lowers along rod <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. Where weight calculations are performed prior to coating, the substrate is made to rest on the weigh platform which acts as a register platform to determine the vertical location of the substrate. Advantageously, the vertical location of the substrate as calculated at the weigh station may be used in the coating station to determine the depth of immersion of the substrate into the slurry. The weigh station is connected to an electronic means which records the weight of the substrates. As with the other stations described herein, the weigh station may be adapted with at least one computer to perform any of the foregoing functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the method aspect of the present invention, as described above, a human operator programs system parameters into a computer prior to commencing operation. Once programmed, the system automatically continues the coating process until operations are terminated or redefined by the operator. A robot or a human operator manually places the uncoated substrate in the loading/unloading station <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> where bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> inflates to hold the substrate securely in place, and the moveable platform advances the substrate to the coating station <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The coating procedure used in the present invention is broadly described by Victor Rosynsky et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,210, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. This procedure is modified in the present invention as described below. When the substrate advances to the coating station, dip pan <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which contains a continuous supply of coating slurry, raises to contact the underside of the inflated bladder clamp in accordance with a prescribed depth. As previously indicated, this is determined based upon a variety of factors such as volume of the substrate, required slurry loading, and viscosity of slurry, etc. The vacuum hood moves downward to sealingly engage one side of the bladder clamp and the raised dip pan sealingly engages the other side of the bladder clamp. In this way, a sealed cavity is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When the substrate is placed into the coating slurry, the coating slurry is drawn upwardly into the interior channels through capillary action even without the imposition of a vacuum. Because there is sufficient volume of the coating slurry above the immersed end of the substrate, capillary action is uniformly provided to all of the channels. As a result, a uniform coating profile can be initially obtained even in the absence of a vacuum. Nevertheless, it is necessary to impose a low intensity vacuum to further draw the coating slurry upwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The low intensity vacuum should be maintained at no more than about 1 inch of water. If the vacuum exceeds this level, the consistency of the length and thickness of the coating may be compromised. The time the low intensity vacuum is applied will vary depending on the consistency and density of the coating slurry and the length the channels to be coated. In most cases, the low intensity vacuum will be applied for from about 1 to 3 seconds. Advantageously, the seal between the substrate periphery and the interior of the bladder clamp enhances the movement and overall uniformity of the coating slurry in the channels. As previously indicated, a second vacuum operation of the same or higher intensity (i.e., greater than 1 inch of water, typically from about 5 to 15 inches of water) can be applied after the vacuum hood is raised and the substrate has been removed from the coating slurry. The duration of the second vacuum operation is typically from about 2 to 4 seconds. In most cases the vacuum operation(s) (i.e., the sum of the first and second vacuum operations) will last for no more than a total time of about 5 seconds. The substrate is then rotated 180&deg; in the bladder clamp and indexed to the air blast station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When the platform reaches the air blast station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is lowered and receiving hood <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> raised to sealingly engaged with upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to form a cavity in which the substrate is positioned. A blast of air, typically pressurized between about 20 to about 50 psi is delivered to the substrate via line <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The duration of the air blast ranges from about 0.3 to about 0.5 seconds, and is typically about 0.3 seconds. After the air blast, upper hood <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is raised, the lower hood lowers, and the platform advances to the load/unload station where bladder clamp <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> deflates and a robot or human operator removes the substrate. As previously discussed, weigh stations may be interposed before the coating station and after the air blast station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Any monolithic substrate can be coated in accordance with the present invention. Such substrates are comprised of fine, parallel gas flow extending therethrough form an inlet face to an outlet face of the substrate so that the channels are open to air flow entering from the front and passing through the substrate and out the rear. Preferably, the channels are essentially straight from their inlet to their outlet and are defined by walls in which a coating slurry is coated as a wash coat so that the gases flowing through the channels contact the coating slurry. The flow channels are thin wall channels which can be of any suitable cross-sectional shape and size such as trapezoidal, rectangular, square, sinusoidal, hexagonal, oval, circular or formed from metallic components which are corrugated and flat as are known in the art. Such structures may contain from about 60 to 1200 or more gas inlet openings (&ldquo;cells&rdquo;) per square inch of cross section. Such structures are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,904,551; 4,329,162; and 4,559,193, each of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Coating slurry which may be coated in accordance with the present invention can vary widely and include, but are not limited to catalyst compositions, absorbent compositions and combinations thereof customarily used for the production of catalytic converters. Multiple coats of different compositions may also be used. Suitable coating slurry compositions are as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,057,483: 4,714,694; and 4,134,860, each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> After the substrate has been removed from the system it may be dried before the substrate is sent to a heating section where the coating is cured. Drying of the coated substrate can be conducted in any suitable manner which may be facilitated by the imposition of a vacuum. A particularly suitable drying process is described in copending application U.S. Ser. No. 09/067,831 filed Apr. 28, 1998, entitled &ldquo;Method for Drying a Coated Substrate,&rdquo; attorney docket number 3924, the contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a substrate may be coated within about 5 to about 10 seconds, even where weigh stations are employed. The amount of dwell time at a single station can vary, and will depend upon coating type, coating thickness, and the like. With a 10-second cycle, single and double coating apparatus may thus coat approximately 360 substrates/hour and 720 substrates/hour, respectively. Likewise, a 5-second cycle will enable the coating of 1420 substrates/hour, making the method extremely efficient. The substrates are uniformly coated, without any of the gaps or overlay present in the prior art methods which require that when opposite ends of the substrate are dipped in the coating slurry. Moreover, substrates coated in accordance with the present invention exhibit lower wet gain and precious metal variability, which demonstrates the reliability and the relatively lower expense of the present invention. For example, prior to the present invention, the wet gain variability between coated substrates was approximately 10-15%. Substrates produced in accordance with the method described herein, by contrast, evidence only about 2.6% wet gain variability. Similarly, prior to the present invention, the total precious metal gradient within a substrate was about 10-20%, while substrates produced as described herein exhibit less than 5% precious metal gradient. As such, precious metal is evenly distributed throughout the substrate, thereby providing controlled precious metal loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Having thus described in invention in rather full detail, it will be recognized that such detail need not be strictly adhered to but that various changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within the scope of the invention, as defined by the subjoined claims. </paragraph>
