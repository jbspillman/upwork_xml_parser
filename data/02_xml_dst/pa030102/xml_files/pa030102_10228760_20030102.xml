<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention relates to novel, improved aiming systems for trajectory weapons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention relates to novel, improved methods and apparatus for sighting (or zeroing in) weapons. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention is particularly concerned with weapons having a low to high trajectory including, but not limited to, machine guns, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, and mortars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A variety of aiming devices and aiming device mounts have been developed for weapons of the character described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Zeroing (or sighting) a weapon equipped with conventionally mounted aiming devices typically involves firing the weapon, adjusting the sight, and repeating the firing/adjusting sequence. This process is time consuming, involves live ammunition, and is further disadvantageous in that the whole process has to be repeated each time a weapon is replaced or a barrel is swapped out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Furthermore,conventional aiming devices&mdash;such as those available for mortars&mdash;are virtually useless in commonly occurring circumstances such as the hours of darkness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in many conventional systems, the aiming device is mounted in a location where it is directly exposed to the recoil generated when the weapon is fired. This can result in the aiming device being moved out of adjustment to the extent that the accuracy of the weapon is significantly degraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, it will be apparent to the reader that there is a need for better aiming systems and better methods for sighting in trajectory weapons. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These needs are met by the novel aiming systems and sighting in methods and apparatus disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The novel aiming systems of the present invention are advantageously designed for use with available and hereafter developed weapon mounts without significant modification of the mount. They are designed to interchangeably accommodate optical, laser, thermal, and other aiming devices as well as combinations of aiming devices. Precise aiming and the capability of achieving first round hits are provided, even under nighttime and other adverse conditions. The precise aiming and first round hit capabilities can be extended to the acquisition of multiple targets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Barrels can be swapped out without disturbing the aiming device(s) that may be in use. This allows a firing mission to be continued without resighting the weapon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As the aiming device systems of the present invention are divorced from the weapon, replacement of a particular weapon with one of a different kind is facilitated. Guide rails capable of supporting a variety of aiming devices are preferably employed, thus facilitating the substitution of one type of sight for another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Interchangeable range scales are preferably employed in the aiming device systems of the present invention. Range scales for a particular type of weapon or ammunition is thereby readily provided. A related advantage of the aiming device mounts disclosed herein is that there is no need to rezero the weapon when switching from one type of ammunition to another; only the selection of the appropriate range scale is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The range scale is preferably illuminated with a low-level blue to green illumination device. Image intensified night vision devices have low sensitivity in that frequency range. Consequently, the illumination is advantageously the same whether the range scale is viewed with the naked eye or through a night vision device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, a novel method of sighting in a trajectory weapon and the apparatus used in accomplishing this objective are disclosed herein. The sighting apparatus includes a mandrel, which encompasses a laser for projecting a dot onto a target. The mandrel is installed in the muzzle or bore of the weapon with the dot being placed on a target bullseye and the aiming device adjusted until it registers with a second indicator such as a cross-hair. This zeroes the weapon for a selected range, and the range scale on the aiming device mount is employed to select other ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Sighting is accomplished easily and quickly and with comparatively inexpensive equipment. The necessity of firing the weapon is eliminated, and the weapon can be sighted with a degree of accuracy that virtually guarantees first round hits.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawing, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a conventional, MK-64 weapons mount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a cradle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and, supported by the mount, a weapon aiming system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> embodying and constructed in accord with the principles of the present invention. Weapon mount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is conventional except for minor modifications employed in attaching aiming system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the weapon mount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The aiming system includes a stationary support plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> fixed to the weapon mount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a sight supporting arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is pivotable with respect to plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a sight supporting rail <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. An interchangeable range scale <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is detachably fixed to the rear end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of pivotable sight support <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a knob <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>fixed to a shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>threaded through adjustment arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and into contact with station. Any support <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided to lock the pivotable sight bearing arm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in a position corresponding to the selected range. (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Detents; <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>engageable by a spring <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>attached to a stationary holder <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) allow the gunner to easily find ranges for which detents are provided. The interchangeable range scale allows a weapon supported in mount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be interchanged and allows one to use range scales appropriate for different types of ammunition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The illustrated embodiment of the invention employs two laser targeting-type devices respectively identified by reference characters <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Laser <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is employed to aim a weapon supported in mount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a target. Laser <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is employed to illuminate the target or, alternatively, to acquire a second, typically moving target. Knobs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are employed to adjust the azimuth and elevation of the laser devices <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> when the weapon supported by mount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is zeroed in as are internal adjustments (not shown) of the character disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,036,517. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, aiming system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fixed to mount <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a clamp bracket <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. These components are also shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Lasers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the mounting arrangement for those lasers are shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The particular lasers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> shown in the drawing are respectively an IZLID-100p illuminator/designator and an IZLID200p illuminator/designator, both available from B. E. Meyers &amp; Company of Redmond, Wash. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is not required that these two laser type aiming devices be employed, and mounting rail is in fact configured to accommodate other types of aiming devices such as conventional optical sights, thermal imaging devices, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, range scale <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably illuminated to facilitate the ranging of the weapon by a gunner. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> block <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is fixed to the stationary component <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of aiming system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the rear end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the stationary component. A U-shaped notch <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in this plate provides an indicator <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that is positioned opposite a mark on scale <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to adjust aiming system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a particular range. Mounted in block <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at one side of notch <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is alluded to range scale illuminator <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. A device capable of providing light in the green to blue range is preferred because the gunner may be employing night vision goggles in periods of darkness. The photomultipliers of night vision goggles are insensitive to light of the colorjust described. The consequent favorable result is that the level of illumination of range scale <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be the same irrespective of whether the scale is viewed through a night vision device or with the naked eye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> caliber heavy barrel machine gun (HBMG) is one of the weapons that weapon mount cradle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is designed to accept. This HBMG is identified by reference character <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which shows the barrel <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the weapon elevated to fire projectiles at a relatively distant target. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the same weapon with barrel <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> depressed to fire projectiles at a closer target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It was pointed out above that one of the significant features of the present invention is a method of bore sighting a weapon such as the illustrated, HBMG 52 with a degree of accuracy which allows for first round hits, an advantage of self-evident importance. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, bore sighting is accomplished with: (a) a laser-equipped mandrel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> installed in the muzzle (or bore) <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the weapon being sighted in such as the illustrated, HBMG 52; and (b) target <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which is set up at a distance of <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> meters from mandrel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The elevation and traverse of weapon <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are adjusted until the beam <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of energy projected from the laser in mandrel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> appears as a dot <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in the circle <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of target <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Lasers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are then adjusted with knobs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the internal adjustments of the two lasers until the beams <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> from the two lasers appear as dots on the cross hairs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of target <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. At that juncture, weapon <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is zeroed in for first round hits on targets at the range for which target <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is configured, in this case 800 meters. Range scale <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can subsequently be employed to target the weapon for other ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent to the reader, the just-described method for zeroing a weapon has the advantage that the firing of live ammunition is not required. Another significant advantage is that a range of the distance for which the weapon is being sighted is not required. In the exemplary method described above, for example, an area of only a little over 10 meters is needed to sight weapon <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for a range of 800 meters. In contrast, to sight a weapon for this distance in the conventional manner requires an 800-meter range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to the reader that the invention may be embodied in many forms in addition to those disclosed herein without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics of the invention. The present embodiment is therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description and the drawings, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
