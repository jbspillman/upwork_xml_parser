<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a bearing that fits and is removable and/or securable to a wall of a reproduction apparatus. The features of the present invention provide in embodiments a mounting system advantageously for use in most any apparatus which requires bearings, for example, electrophotographic printing machines. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Electrophotographic marking is a well-known, commonly used method of copying or printing documents. Electrophotographic marking is performed by exposing a charged photoreceptor with a light image representation of a desired document. The photoreceptor is discharged in response to that light image, creating an electrostatic latent image of the desired document on the photoreceptor&apos;s surface. Toner particles are then deposited onto that latent image, forming a toner image, which is then transferred onto a substrate, such as a sheet of paper. The transferred toner image is then fused to the substrate, usually using heat and/or pressure, thereby creating a permanent record of the original representation. The surface of the photoreceptor is then cleaned of residual developing material and recharged in preparation for the production of other images. Other marking technologies, for example, electrostatographic marking and ionography are also well-known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An electrophotographic marking machine generally includes bearings for supporting and connecting parts, for example, a shaft. While such bearings are generally successful, fastening of the bearing to a member may be time consuming and costly. Bearings may add to the cost of the machine. Further, the bearing may wear or fail and cause inefficient operation of the machine. In addition, manufacturing time is required to install the bearings and to connect the components to the bearings during assembly of the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Also, to conserve natural resources and provide for a machine with improved features and more reliable newer technology, machinery is often remanufactured and disassembled. Furthermore, the removal of the bearings represents a cost associated with remanufacturing of the machines. The time required to remove bearings may be a significant remanufacturing cost factor. Components have typically been joined together with the use of bearings in the form of welding, rivets or screws. Rivets require the use of special machinery to assemble, may become loose and rattle during use and are difficult and expensive to remove for remanufacturing. Screws have disadvantages in that they require a substantial amount of assembly time, may become loose during use, and may become very time consuming to remove. Therefore, a bearing that may be easily manufactured and that is removeably securable to a surface for use with other parts would be beneficial. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it has been increasingly important to develop lighter materials for the framework of the machines. Accordingly, many modern machines utilize a fabricated sheet metal or plastic frame resulting in relatively thin walled support structures. Throughout a typical printing machine, there are many shafts utilized to support idler rollers, drive rollers. It is therefore desirable to provide a bearing which can be utilized in a wall while still providing generally high durability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Reference is made to the following United States patents relating to reproduction machines and components such as bearings briefly summarized as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,024,497 relates to a bushing mountable in a housing for supporting a rotating member and for providing a bias force to the rotating member. The bushing includes a body defining an aperture therein and a mounting member for mounting the bushing to the housing. The bushing also includes a biasing member operably associated with said body and said mounting member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,632,684 relates to a shaft assembly and method of forming a shaft assembly having an elongated hollow shaft with a stepped portion on the surface of the shaft. The stepped portion of the shaft surface is formed of two straight edge sections joined by an inclined section. A gear having a corresponding straight/inclined edge configuration engages the shaft and contacts the shaft only on the corresponding straight edge portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,475 relates to a shaft assembly comprising an elongated member having at least a portion which is hollow, tubular, shell like having an inside surface defining a shaft core and an outside surface defining a shaft functional surface, the shaft core being filled with a hardened, moldable material, and the shaft functional surface having at least one functional feature thereon, which is of hardened, moldable material integrally molded with the hardened, moldable material in the shaft core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,885 relates to a plain flanged bearing or bushing for supporting a rotating shaft in a thin walled frame of an electrophotographic printing machine. The composite bearing has a flanged end and is adapted to be inserted in an opening in a thin walled support member until the flange abuts the surface of the wall. A protruding tab formed by displacing a small portion of the flange extends in an axial direction along the bearing and cooperates with a corresponding opening in the wall to prevent rotation of the bearing. A friction push nut or snap ring is attached to the bearing on the side of the wall opposite the flange. The protruding tab prevents the bearing from rotating about an axis which can cause the bearing to be worn on the exterior surface by rotational contact with the thin wall. A shaft to support idler rolls or other rotating elements is inserted in an inner bore of the bearing and is rotatably supported thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,457,520 relates to a bearing for supporting a moving member on a support structure. The bearing includes a substantially U-shaped member having an internal periphery and an external periphery. The bearing also includes a first securer, associated with the internal periphery of the U-shaped member, for securing the moving member to the U-shaped member and a second securer, associated with the external periphery of the U-shaped member, for securing the U-shaped member to the support structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,804,277 relates to a bearing mounting system for mounting and retaining a rotatable shaft between first and second bearings mounted to first and second spaced frame members of a machine frame, utilizing commercially available bearings, with respective inner and outer races. Both bearings inner races are press fitted onto the shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,134,175 relates to a non-rotating sleeve type bushing in which an eccentric flange integral with the bushing and projecting radially outwardly therefrom is so formed as to be received in a complementarily contoured flange recess in a bearing housing whereby rotation of the bushing with respect to the bearing housing is precluded by a positive mechanical locking action provided by the shear resistance of the flange member. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While the principles of the present invention will be described in connection with an electrostatographic reproduction machine, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to that embodiment or to that application. Therefore, it is should be understood that the principles of the present invention extend to all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to embodiments of a bearing for use in walls of reproduction machines. Although the bearing of the present invention is particularly well adapted for use in the illustrative printing machine, it will become evident that the bearing is equally well suited for use in a wide variety of machines and are not necessarily limited in its application to the particular embodiment shown herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> of the drawings, an illustrative reproduction machine incorporating the bearing of the present invention is shown. The reproduction machine employs a photoconductive belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to advance successive portions sequentially through the various processing stations disposed about the path of movement thereof. Belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is entrained about stripping roller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, tensioning roller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, idler roll <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and drive roller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As roller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates, it advances belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Initially, a portion of the photoconductive surface passes through charging station A. At charging station A, two corona generating devices indicated generally by the reference numerals <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> charge the photoconductive belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a relatively high, substantially uniform potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Next, the charged portion of the photoconductive surface is advanced through imaging station B. At the imaging station, an imaging module indicated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, records an electrostatic latent image on the photoconductive surface of the belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Imaging module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a raster output scanner (ROS). The ROS lays out the electrostatic latent image in a series of horizontal scan lines with each line having a specified number of pixels per inch. Other types of imaging systems may also be used employing, for example, a pivoting or shiftable LED write bar or projection LCD (liquid crystal display) or other electro-optic display as the &ldquo;write&rdquo; source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The imaging module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (ROS) includes a laser <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for generating a collimated beam of monochromatic radiation <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, an electronic subsystem (ESS) associated with the machine electronic printing controller <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> transmits a set of signals via <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> corresponding to a series of pixels to the laser <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or modulator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a modulator and beam shaping optics unit <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which modulates the beam <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in accordance with the image information received from the ESS, and a rotatable polygon <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> having mirror facets for sweep deflecting the beam <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> into raster scan lines which sequentially expose the surface of the belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at imaging station B. A user interface (UI) <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is associated with the controller <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> advances the electrostatic latent image recorded thereon to development station C. Development station C has three magnetic brush developer rolls indicated generally by the reference numerals <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A paddle wheel picks up developer material and delivers it to the developer rolls. When the developer material reaches rolls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, it is magnetically split between the rolls with half of the developer material being delivered to each roll. Photoconductive belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is partially wrapped about rolls <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to form extended development zones. Developer roll <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is a clean-up roll. The latent image attracts toner particles from the carrier granules of the developer material to form a toner powder image on the photoconductive surface of belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then advances the toner powder image to transfer station D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> At transfer station D, a copy sheet is moved into contact with the toner powder image. First, photoconductive belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is exposed to a pretransfer light from a lamp (not shown) to reduce the attraction between photoconductive belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the toner powder image. Next, a corona, generating device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> charges the copy sheet to the proper magnitude and polarity so that the copy sheet is tacked to photoconductive belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the toner powder image is attracted from the photoconductive belt to the copy sheet. After transfer, corona generator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> charges the copy sheet to the opposite polarity to detack the copy sheet from belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Conveyor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> then advances the copy sheet to fusing station E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Fusing station E includes a fuser assembly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which permanently affixes the transferred toner powder image to the copy sheet. Preferably, fuser assembly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes a heated fuser roller <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and a pressure roller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with the powder image on the copy sheet contacting fuser roller <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The pressure roller is cammed against the fuser roller to provide the necessary pressure to fix the toner powder image to the copy sheet. The fuser roll <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is internally heated by a quartz lamp. Release agent, stored in a reservoir, is pumped to a metering roll. A trim blade trims off the excess release agent. The release agent transfers to a donor roll and then to the fuser roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> After fusing, the copy sheets are fed through a decurler <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Decurler <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> bends the copy sheet in one direction to put a known curl in the copy sheet and then bends it in the opposite direction to remove that curl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Forwarding rollers <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> then advance the sheet to duplex turn roll <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Duplex solenoid gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> guides the sheet to the finishing station F, or to duplex tray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. At finishing station F, copy sheets are stacked in a compiler tray and attached to one another to form sets. When duplex solenoid gate <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> diverts the sheet into duplex tray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Duplex tray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provides an intermediate or buffer storage for those sheets that have been printed on one side and on which an image will be subsequently printed on the second, opposite side thereof, i.e., the sheets being duplexed. The sheets are stacked in duplex tray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> facedown on top of one another in the order in which they are copied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> To complete duplex copying, the simplex sheets in tray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are fed, in seriatim, by bottom feeder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> from tray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> back to transfer station D via conveyor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and rollers <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for transfer of the toner powder image to the opposed sides of the copy sheets. Inasmuch as successive bottom sheets are fed from duplex tray <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the proper or clean side of the copy sheet is positioned in contact with belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at transfer station D so that the toner powder image is transferred thereto. The duplex sheet is then fed through the same path as the simplex sheet to be advanced to finishing station F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The high capacity variable sheet size sheet feeder <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is the primary source of copy sheets. Feed belt <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> feeds successive uppermost sheets from the stack to a take-away drive roll <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and idler rolls <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The drive roll and idler rolls guide the sheet onto transport <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Transport <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> advances the sheet to rolls <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which, in turn, move the sheet to transfer station D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Secondary tray <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and auxiliary tray <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are secondary sources of copy sheets. Copy sheets are fed to transfer station D from the secondary tray <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> or auxiliary tray <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Sheet feeders <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are friction retard feeders utilizing feed belts and take-away rolls to advance successive copy sheets to transport <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which advances the sheets to rolls <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and then to transfer station D. The copy sheet is registered just prior to entering transfer station D so that the sheet is aligned to receive the developed image thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Invariably, after the copy sheet is separated from the photoconductive belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, some residual particles remain adhering thereto. After transfer, photoconductive belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes beneath corona generating device <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which charges the residual toner particles to the proper polarity. Thereafter, the pre-charge erase lamp (not shown), located inside photoconductive belt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, discharges the photoconductive belt in preparation for the next charging cycle. Residual particles are removed from the photoconductive surface at cleaning station G. Cleaning station G includes an electrically biased cleaner brush <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and two de-toning rolls <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The various machine functions are regulated by a controller <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is preferably a programmable microprocessor which controls all of the machine functions hereinbefore described. The controller provides a comparison count of the copy sheets, the number of documents being recirculated, the number of copy sheets selected by the operator, time delays, jam corrections, etc. The control of all of the exemplary systems heretofore described may be accomplished by conventional control switch inputs from the printing machine consoles selected by the operator. Conventional sheet path sensors or switches may be utilized to keep track of the position of the document and the copy sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, illustrated is a partial cut-away view from the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> reproduction machine illustrating one of the bearings <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention as it is about to be installed in a wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Also shown is a shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as it is about to be installed into a shaft support portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The shaft support portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a bore <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (not shown) that is formed in a generally cylindrical shape to allow rotation of the shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> therein. A flange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extends radially from the shaft support portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In operation, the bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted into the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> until a surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (not shown) of the flange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> contacts a surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A plurality of flexible members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are used to hold the bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> substantially secure to the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The flexible members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> originate from an outside surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the shaft support portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and then extend toward the flange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. After the surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the flange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is positioned against the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, radial pressure to the flexible members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is released and the ends <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the flexible members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adjust to their free state to a position which is wider than an opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The ends <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the flexible members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> apply force against the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and physically impede the bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from rotating about its axis and from becoming unsecured from the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The ends <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the flexible members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have sufficient surface area for contact with the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to limit rotation of the bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> illustrate front and side elevational views of the bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The flexible members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are flexible and are moveable from an expanded free state to a lower profile state, less than the expanded free state, sufficient to allow passage of the members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be molded of plastic, in one piece. The flange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has notches to enable manufacture of the members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a two-part mold using an injection molding process. The notches may also aid in gripping the bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during insertion. The opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may also have notches to aid in insertion of the bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and to allow the members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to clear the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then may be rotated such that the flexible members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are situated away from the notches in the opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the ends <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the flexible members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be formed into a offset shape and extend sufficiently over an edge of the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into the notch area of the wall opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to prevent rotation of the bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, the ends <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the flexible members <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may also have a chamfer or angular portions for aiding positioning of the ends <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into the notch of the opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The flange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes an end cap to restrain the end of the shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> thus making the use of clips such as &lsquo;e&rsquo; clips unnecessary. The flange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be circular, square, rectangular, or irregular, provided it is of sufficient size, for example, a sufficient diameter to provide stability against the surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and to cover the opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the wall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The dimensions of the bearing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are intended to be suited for applications inside a reproduction machine although additional sizes and uses are envisioned.
