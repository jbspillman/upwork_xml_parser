<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a back-supported load-carrying mechanism and, in particular, to a back-supported load-carrying mechanism that includes a suspension-mounted, pivoting lumbar support element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The use of backpack devices (backpacks and backpack frames used for carrying loads) is known in the prior art. Existing embodiments have utilized a single horizontal bar, a padded horizontal bar, a narrow strap, or molded pads to provide support for the backpack device in the lumbar region of the user&apos;s back. However, there are problems with the comfort and functionality of these existing lumbar supports. Due to the shortcomings of existing lumbar supports, backpack devices often slide down from the weight of the load being carried and tend to shift off center providing uneven weight distribution on the shoulders and back of the user. Further, existing lumbar supports do not conform to the backs of the wide variety of individuals wearing the backpack device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It would be advantageous to have a back-supported load-carrying mechanism that overcomes the shortcomings of existing backpack devices. The present invention provides such a mechanism. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved back-supported load-carrying mechanism which includes a suspension-mounted pivoting lumbar support element to allow for an even distribution of cargo weight to the lower back of a user, and to provide a shock-absorbing mechanism, thus eliminating stress to the neck and back areas of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a back-supported load-carrying mechanism that includes a rigid frame having an upper portion and a lower portion with an opening therein. A lumbar support element is pivotally mounted on a horizontal shaft in the opening in the lower portion of the frame, and is positioned to contact the lumbar region of a user&apos;s back. The load-carrying mechanism also includes a suspension mechanism that mounts the horizontal shaft to the frame and enables the horizontal shaft to move fore and aft in relation to the frame. The load-carrying mechanism may also include two rear leg extensions on each side of the frame that provide support for the load-carrying mechanism and enable the load-carrying mechanism to stand in an essentially vertical orientation when the load-carrying mechanism is removed by a user and placed on the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a back-supported load-carrying mechanism that includes a rigid frame having an upper portion and a lower portion, the lower portion including a first vertical side and a second vertical side forming an opening therebetween. A horizontal shaft is mounted to the first and second vertical sides and extends through the opening in the lower portion of the frame. A lumbar support element is pivotally mounted on the horizontal shaft. The lumbar support element extends horizontally from the first vertical side to the second vertical side of the frame, and extends vertically approximately halfway up the frame. The horizontal shaft is mounted to the first and second vertical sides of the frame with a suspension mechanism that enables the horizontal shaft (and lumbar support element) to move fore and aft in relation to the frame. The suspension mechanism may enable each end of the horizontal shaft, and thus each side of the lumbar support, to move fore and aft independently of the other end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a back-supported load-carrying mechanism that includes a rigid frame and a floating lumbar support element. The frame has an upper portion and a lower portion with an opening therein. The floating lumbar support element is suspendably mounted in the opening in the lower portion so that the lumbar support element can pivot around a horizontal axis while also moving fore and aft in relation to the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and various other advantages and features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and forming a part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, its advantages, and the objects obtained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to the accompanying descriptive matter, in which there is illustrated and described preferred embodiments of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The above-described figures illustrate a back-supported load-carrying mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a pivoting lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The pivoting lumbar support element provides the mechanism with consistent weight distribution even when the user is performing physical activities involving bending at the waist and leaning from side-to-side because the lumbar support element pivots proportionately with the users varying body position. The mechanism effectively shifts the weight of the load from the user&apos;s shoulders to a broad area of the user&apos;s lower back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a rear perspective view of the first embodiment of the present invention in its folded configuration. The back-supported load-carrying mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a molded frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The front side of the frame (the side resting against the user&apos;s back) is designed to mimic the curvature of the spine. The front side of the frame has a region of convex curvature <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) throughout the thoracic, lumbar, and upper sacrum areas of the back. The frame transitions to a region of concave curvature <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>just above the thoracic region towards the upper back, and neck areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a raised lip edge around all the forward facing surfaces for accepting, containing, and/or protecting the edges of a polyolefin foam inlay. This foam is applied to all surfaces of the back-supported load-carrying mechanism which come in direct contact with the user&apos;s body. This includes the molded back-support portion of the frame, the rear and front surfaces of the lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and both integrated vertical frame extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. In the first embodiment, the foam inlay is a closed-cell cross-linked polyofin foam product. Actual foam density, type and color may vary depending on the specific use application or style. This is a lightweight water-resistant product that provides comfort and cushion to any body parts with which it comes in contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The frame has a plurality of large openings <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> molded in the upper back, shoulder and neck regions to decrease weight and provide ventilation. An elliptical-shaped opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the top of the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provides a handle for carrying the back-supported load-carrying mechanism when it is not being worn. Several holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> running from the front to the back of the frame act as tie down points to secure the load being carried and to provide for additional items to be affixed or temporarily tied to the mechanism. Two frame extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>extend downward to form the base of the frame on each side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A load-support piece <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be connected to the frame extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to provide a support shelf for the load being carried and to transfer the weight of the load to the lower lumbar and upper hip regions rather than to the neck and shoulder areas of the user. The load-support piece is interchangeable, and different load-support pieces are designed to hold varying selected items such as camping gear, drink coolers, scuba tanks, and other specific use items. A male extension <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on each side of the load support piece slides into and interlocks with a female connector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> such as a four-sided open channel (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) formed in the rear side of each frame extension <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An ergonomically designed lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted in the lower portion of the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between the frame extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The lumbar support element may be constructed as a plurality of vertically oriented sub-elements <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connected by horizontal cross pieces <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The sub-elements extend vertically, approximately halfway up the back of the user. The lumbar support element extends horizontally the full width of the frame, thus providing a large area of surface contact with the user&apos;s back. The lumbar support element can also be constructed with an open grid design as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> pivots around a horizontal axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, mounted to each of the frame extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>approximately &frac14;to &frac13;of the way up the lumbar support element. The axle is a rod made from metal or another suitable rigid material, that runs horizontally through the entire lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and is mounted in the frame extensions. The back-supported load-carrying mechanism may be attached to the user&apos;s body by the use of shoulder straps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a waist strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The frame and lumbar support element may be constructed of any suitable lightweight, rigid material such as wood, plastic, aluminum, and so on. In the first embodiment, the frame and lumbar support element are constructed from an injection-molded or compression-molded plastic/graphite composite. In general, graphite composites provide the best strength-to-weight ratio, but are more expensive than other materials available, such as polycarbonates, nylon and fiberglass. Poly-carbonate plastics provide sufficient strength at a lower cost, but may be heavier than graphite composites. Suitable materials may also be formed from metals such as tungsten or copper/carbon/aluminum composites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a side elevational view of the first embodiment of the present invention with the lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> pivoting forward and downward. When the back-supported load-carrying mechanism is worn on the back, the pivoting lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> changes its angle to correlate with the user&apos;s body positions, thereby distributing the weight of the load consistently to the hips and upper sacrum region of the user which eliminates stress to the neck and upper back areas of the user. The total pivoting range of the lumbar support element is approximately 105 degrees, 95 degrees in the forward direction and 10 degrees in the rearward direction. The surface of the lumbar support element that contacts the user&apos;s back is curved to provide an anthropometrically correct curvature, matching the curvature of the user&apos;s back. The front surface is also covered by the non-sliding foam inlay <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Thus, the pivoting of the lumbar support element, the curvature of its surface, the large area of surface contact between the lumbar support element and the user&apos;s back, and the non-sliding foam inlay utilized on the lumbar support element prevent the pack from sliding down the user&apos;s back or slipping from side to side during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a side elevation view of the first embodiment of the present invention with the lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a fully downward position to form a seat. The lumbar support element can be converted into a seat by pivoting the lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> approximately 95 degrees downwards. Rotation of the lumbar support element is stopped at approximately 95 degrees when the lower end of the lumbar support element pivots rearward and upward, and contacts the lower surface of the load support piece <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The reverse side of the pivoting lumbar support piece then provides a seat for the user which is concavely curved and covered in a foam inlay <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The frame extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>function as the front two legs of a chair when the lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pivoted to the seat position. The load support piece <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> functions as a rear support for the chair. The inclination of the back of the chair is thus determined by the length and curvature of the interchangeable load-support piece <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a partial exploded perspective view of an optional stopping mechanism <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for the lumbar support element. A raised protrusion piece <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is stationary and molded into the inside facing walls of each of the frame extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. A corresponding stop piece <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is molded on either side of the lumbar support element, and rotates therewith. Both pieces surround a hole <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> through which the fixed axle is inserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a partial side elevational view of the optional stopping mechanism of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> when the pivoting lumbar support element is in the fully downward position. Stoppage of the lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> occurs when the lumbar support stop piece <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>contacts the raised protrusion piece <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the frame extension. When the lumbar support element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pivoted to the fully upward position, the other end of the stop piece <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>contacts the other end of the raised protrusion piece <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby stopping the lumbar support element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a front perspective views of the first embodiment of the present invention in its unfolded configuration. A series of paired parallel slots <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are cut through the back frame where the top ends of the shoulder straps <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are inserted through and affixed to the frame. Each pair of slots allows the back-supported load-carrying mechanism to be placed at a different height in order to fit the user. The waist strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted through a slot <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> located on the front face of each vertical extension and exits through a slot located on the outer side of each vertical extension <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. These slots are located just above the axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A buckle located on the other end of the waist strap allows the strap to be affixed around the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Once the back-supported load-carrying mechanism is unfolded, the user is provided with an off the ground, convenient chair since no fasteners, latches, screws, or tools are required to make this transformation possible. Conversion does not require any of the gear or load supported on the molded frame to be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the load support piece can be eliminated, and a container such as a canvas bag may be attached to the frame for carrying articles such as books. This configuration more easily fits into school lockers, or is more easily carried on a school bus when the back-supported load-carrying mechanism is used as a book bag holder. The same benefits are provided by the pivoting lumbar support <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, preventing slippage of the book bag, and placing an even distribution of the weight on the user&apos;s hips and lower back areas. This is important for young children carrying a heavy load of books to school. This configuration also allows for larger items that may extend below the user&apos;s waist (such as a kayak) to be carried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a right rear perspective view of a second embodiment of the present invention. The second embodiment includes a suspension-mounted, pivoting lumbar support <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The lumbar support is mounted on a floating horizontal shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, similar to the horizontal shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> except that the floating horizontal shaft is free to move in the fore and aft direction along arcuate slots <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> formed in the frame extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on each side of the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The slots are essentially horizontal, but may be slightly arcuate, with the center of their radius of curvature fixed at a point above the slots. The ends of the horizontal shaft extend through the slots and a fastener <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> holds the shaft in place at each end. An anti-friction bushing <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is mounted on the shaft near each end. The bushings rest within the arcuate slots and guide the shaft&apos;s movement fore and aft within the slots. The bushing at each end of the shaft slides in its respective slot independently of the other bushing. Therefore, while a symmetrical rearward force on the lumbar support will cause the entire horizontal shaft to slide uniformly rearward, an off-center force will result in one side of the shaft moving rearward more than the other side. Thus, the shaft and the lumbar support &ldquo;float&rdquo; as the dynamic load shifts against the user&apos;s back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring briefly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is shown a left rear perspective view of a lower portion of the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and frame extension <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>illustrating in more detail, the components of the suspension-mounted horizontal shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and pivoting lumbar support <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. A flexible tensioner <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is mounted above the arcuate horizontal slots <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> at the approximate center of their radius of curvature. The tensioner may be constructed of any suitable elastomeric material such as plastic, plastic composite, nylon, metal, or the like. The top of each tensioner is securely mounted into the frame extension <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in a manner suitable to prevent the tensioner from rotating. The lower end of each tensioner contacts the anti-friction bushing <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> on each end of the shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, applying forward pressure against the bushing and the shaft in the direction of the user&apos;s back. In this manner, as the load on the lumbar support pushes the shaft rearward, the shaft is free to move rearward in the slots against the forward force applied by the tensioners. Thus, the dynamic load is absorbed by the suspension-mounted pivoting lumbar support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The tensioners <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be mounted on the outside of each frame extension <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, thus providing a total of two tensioners. Optionally, the tensioners may be mounted on both the inside and the outside of each frame extension, thus providing a total of four tensioners. Additionally, the tensioners may be removably mounted so that tensioners of different stiffness may be interchanged to accommodate different load weights, according to the desires of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, as noted above, the ends of the shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are formed to accept the fastener <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on each end to capture the shaft, lumbar support <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, bushings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and waist belt <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The waist belt attaches to the fastener <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, thus forming a continuous belt around the user&apos;s waist which holds the lumbar support firmly against the lumbar region of the user&apos;s back. It can thus be appreciated that when the load-carrying mechanism is in actual use, the suspension-mounted lumbar support is essentially held stationary against the user&apos;s back by the waist belt, while the rigid frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and load support element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are allowed to float independent of the lumbar support as the bushings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> travel within the slots <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and the frame pivots around the shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Another change in the second embodiment is that the load support element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> attaches to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a different manner. The load support element slides onto two rear leg extensions <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> on each side of the frame. A second horizontal shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extends through the forward portion of the load support element, and extends through each of the vertical frame extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. A second fastener <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is attached to each end of the second horizontal shaft to retain the shaft in place. To remove the load support piece, one of the second fasteners is removed, and the second horizontal shaft is pulled out of the load support piece. The load support piece is then slid off of the rear leg extensions <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The second horizontal shaft may then be replaced in the frame to function as a stop for the back end of the pivoting lumbar support when it is rotated to the seat position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of size, shape and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. </paragraph>
