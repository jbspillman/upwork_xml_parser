<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A plasma reactor is provided for achieving extension of etching parameters to reduce charge-up shape anomaly and to improve selectivity, uniformity and workability in a dry etching process. An RF power fluctuates in cycles, each one of the cycles including first and second subcycles (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>), (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) with different frequencies. The RF power in the first subcycles (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) is higher in frequency than that in the second subcycles (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). A charge accumulated during the first subcycles (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) in which the RF power of high frequency is applied can be relieved during the second subcycles (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) in which the RF power of low frequency is applied. At the same time, deterioration in an etching rate occurring with the application of only the RF power of low frequency can be relieved by applying the RF power of high frequency during the first subcycles (<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention is directed to a plasma reactor, especially to a dry etching apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a sectional view generally showing an ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) etching apparatus which is a kind of conventional plasma processing apparatuses. In a plasma production chamber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, plasma is produced from process gas by &mgr; wave <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and transferred to a reaction chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The plasma exposes wafers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> biassed by an RF power obtained by an RF power supply means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are various parameters for controlling an etching process in the ECR etching apparatus, including shape and position of an ECR face <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (which also depends on a magnetic field provided by coils <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), the RF power, the &mgr; wave <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, a method of electrostatic chuck for the wafers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, pressure from process gas or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An apparatus of high integration and a fine structure has made it more and more difficult to achieve etching with high anisotropy, high selectivity and high uniformity. There are many cases that the present etching parameters are not enough to achieve a desirable etching. Anomalies in etching shape due to charge-up (referred to as &ldquo;charge-up shape anomaly&rdquo; hereinafter) has been raised as one of problems to prevent the formation of a fine structure in recent years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference> are enlarged sectional views in the vicinity of the surface of a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, illustrating the charge-up shape anomaly. Each figure shows the behavior of ions (shown by circled &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo;) and electrons (shown by circled &ldquo;&minus;&rdquo;) when a fine pattern etching of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is performed by means of a plasma etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21, a</cross-reference> SiO2 film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a Si film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a resist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed one after another on the surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The Si film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is etched with the resist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as a mask. In this case, as etching proceeds, electrical neutrality is maintained by incidence of both ions and electrons on the surface of the resist pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a fine pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, incidence of ions occurs perpendicular to the surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Thus, ions can reach to a bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the fine pattern <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with no collision with side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, electrons have no directional property to be incident on the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, thereby having difficulty in reaching to the bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, when a conductive film such as the Si film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is etched, ions incident on the bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and electrons incident on the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are recombined in the Si film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be neutralized. Thus, electrical neutrality is maintained. On the other hand, when the bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> moves downward due to the etching progress and exposes an insulating film such as the SiO2 film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, ions incident on the bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and electrons incident on the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are not neutralized. Thus, the bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is positively charged up due to the ion incidence while the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are negatively charged due to the electron incidence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the orbit of ions incident on the bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is bent by repulsion of positive charge on the bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and gravitation of negative charge on the side walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. This causes local incidence of ions on the interface between the Si film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the SiO2 film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and then produces a V-shaped notch (reference character A shows notch amount). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To decrease such charge-up shape anomaly, a method for pulsing the &mgr; wave <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or the RF power (to repeat ON/OFF periods thereof) has been advocated. When both of the &mgr; wave <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the RF power are in the ON period, normal discharge occurs, causing progress in charge-up in a fine pattern. On the contrary, when either of the &mgr; wave <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or the RF power is in the OFF period, incidence of electrons on the bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is made possible by no directional difference between ions and electrons, thereby dissolving charge-up. That is, charge-up proceeded during the ON period can be dissolved during the OFF period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Such control over the movement of charged particles is very important not only for dissolution of shape anomalies but also for control of a selectivity ratio and uniformity. The method for pulsing conventional &mgr; wave <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and RF power is however limited, so that extension of pulse methods has been required for controlling broader etching parameters. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, a plasma reactor comprises a stage to which a frequency-modulated RF power is applied; and a reaction chamber containing plasma exposed to a sample mounted on the stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, a plasma reactor comprises a stage to which an RF power is applied; and a reaction chamber containing plasma exposed to a sample mounted on the stage, wherein the RF power fluctuates in cycles, each one of the cycles consisting of a plurality of first and second subcycles with the RF power of different amplitudes, wherein the plurality of first subcycles have different lengths, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the present invention, a plasma reactor comprises a stage to which an RF power is applied; and a reaction chamber containing plasma exposed to a sample mounted on the stage, wherein the RF power presents a waveform in which an AC waveform with a predetermined initial phase is intermittently superimposed on a DC value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, an intermittently supplied &mgr; wave produces the plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the plasma reactor of the first aspect of the present invention, accumulation of charge occurring with the RF power of high frequency can be relieved with the RF power of low frequency. At the same time, deterioration in an etching rate, which is regarded as one of problems when only the RF power of low frequency is applied, can be relieved with the RF power of high frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to the plasma reactor in the second aspect of the present invention, in one cycle that the RF power fluctuates, the first subcycles have different lengths, respectively. Thus, charge-up can be relieved during one of the subcycles while deterioration in an etching rate can be suppressed during the other of the subcycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the plasma reactor in the third aspect of the present invention, an area more positive than DC components becomes larger than that more negative than DC components in the range of superimposition of RF components by setting the initial phase within the range of 180&deg; to 360&deg;. This results in improvement in a notch amount and a selectivity ratio. Further, the area more positive than DC components becomes smaller than that more negative than DC components in the range of superimposition of RF components by setting the initial phase within the range of 0 &deg; to 180 &deg;. This results in improvement in a CD gain and an etching rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, an intermittent introduction of the &mgr; wave into the plasma reactor leads to reduction in a notch amount. Further, an intermittent application of the RF power to the stage leads to a remarkable effect in improving etching characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The object of this invention is to provide a plasma reactor capable of extending etching parameters for reducing charge-up shape anomaly in dry etching and for improving etching performance such as selectivity, uniformity and workability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> &lt;First Preferred Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view generally showing an ECR etching apparatus as a plasma reactor according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. A chamber in the ECR etching apparatus is roughly divided into a plasma production chamber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a reaction chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A reactive process gas is introduced into the chamber from an inlet <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> while exhausted from an outlet <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, so that a predetermined pressure is maintained. A microwave <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of 2.45 GHz generated from a &mgr; wave power <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> passes through a waveguide to be introduced into the chamber via a leading window <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Since a magnetic field is applied in the chamber by coils <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an ECR resonance region (ECR surface) exists in the plasma production chamber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to produce an ECR plasma. The magnetic field generated by the coils <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> diverges from the plasma production chamber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the reaction chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that the ECR plasma is carried to wafers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> mounted on a stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This ECR plasma etches the wafers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Further, the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on which the wafers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are mounted is connected to an RF power source supply device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for supplying the RF power for etching, which will be described in detail later. Further, the wafers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are induced by static electricity generated by a power source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to contact with the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (referred to as electrostatic chuck) for cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a graph showing a waveform of an RF power generated by the RF power supply device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The frequency of the RF power applied in the first preferred embodiment is pulse-modulated. The RF power fluctuates in cycles, each one of the cycles consisting of a first and a second subcycles <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with different frequencies. The graph indicates that the RF power in the first subcycle <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is higher in frequency than that in the second subcycles <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In general, the RF power of high frequency produces a high self-bias voltage. This increases an ion energy to remarkably raise an etching rate while increasing charge due to a heavy directional movement of ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, the RF power of low frequency produces a low self-bias voltage. This prevents charge-up, but results in a low etching rate and small anisotoropy. Thus, a continuous application of only the RF power of low frequency has not been put to practical use in general. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> According to the first preferred embodiment, the RF power of high frequency and the RF power of low frequency are applied in turn. Thus, accumulation of charge during the first subcycle <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in which the RF power of high frequency is applied can be relieved during the second subcycle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in which the RF power of low frequency is applied. Further, a decline in the etching rate, which is regarded as one of problems when only the RF power of low frequency is applied, can be relieved by applying the RF power of high frequency in the first subcycle <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The ECR etching apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is applied as well in the second preferred embodiment. The RF power fluctuates in cycles. In each one of the cycles, the frequency of the RF power fluctuates with constant amplitude, showing a frequency-modulated waveform. In this case, the aforementioned effect can be obviously obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> &lt;Third Preferred Embodiment&gt;It has been a well-known technique to apply a pulsed RF power to the wafers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the OFF period <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> is long, accumulation of charge is relieved. However, etching progress stops due to disappearance of plasma during the period, reducing an etching rate in the etching period as a whole. Further, since the ON period <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> lasts long as well in such case, accumulation of charge reaches to a saturation value. Then, a long lasting charge-up period is apt to cause shape anomalies. </paragraph>

In this case, charge accumulated during the ON period <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> is suppressed, so that less shape anomaly occurs. An early end of the ON period <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, however, prevents an enough rise of a self-bias potential, so that an etching rate is decreased as compared with the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

In this case, an etching rate can be increased during the ON period <highlight><bold>273</bold></highlight> without interfering a rise of a self-bias potential. It is, however, impossible to sufficiently relieve accumulation of charge during the OFF period <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight>, so that accumulated charge will reach to a saturation value (i.e. charge-up) after several cycles. </paragraph>

When the initial phase &agr; is 90&deg;, the application of the RF power accelerates ions in the direction of a substrate while decelerating electrons and reducing an electron current. Thus, positive charge-up at the bottom portion of a pattern is not dissolved while negative charge accumulated on the side wall of the pattern is reduced, which results in little effect in improving notch. On the contrary, when the initial phase &agr; is 270&deg;, a retarding electrical field of electrons weakens and reduces accumulation of charge at the bottom portion of the pattern.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Since the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is connected to the RF power supply device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the blocking capacitor <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, potential of the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with no application of the RF power is equal to a floating potential Vf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a graph showing potential of the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the RF power is continuously applied. The amount that the maximum potential of the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> goes over the floating potential Vf is smaller than that the minimum potential of the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> goes below the floating potential Vf. As the number of cycles k is increased, change in potential of the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has less dependency on the initial phase &agr;, getting closer to the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. That is, the number of times to induce ions into the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> increases.

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As described above, it becomes possible to control a notch amount and a selectivity ratio by setting the number of cycles k or the initial phase &agr; during the ON period of the pulsed RF power.

The ECR etching apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is applied as well in the seventh preferred embodiment. A &mgr; wave power source <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> generates a &mgr; wave <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the form of pulse (intermittently). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> An introduction of the pulsed &mgr; wave <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> into a plasma reactor brings about reduction in a notch amount, which is taught, for example, by Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 35(1996) p2450. According to this preferred embodiment, the plasma reactor not only generates plasma from the pulsed &mgr; wave but also provides the pulsed RF power, which is described in the fifth and sixth preferred embodiments, with the stage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The combination of such techniques has a remarkable effect in improving etching characteristics such as reduction in a notch amount. </paragraph>

It becomes possible to control microscopic ion energy as well as a notch amount by controlling a delay time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. The delay time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is defined as how long the beginning of superimposition of RF components on DC components (floating potential Vf) delays from the beginning of intermittent ON period of the &mgr; wave <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a graph showing correlation between the delay time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and a notch amount, where a cycle of the &mgr; wave is T (duty 50%) and the period of superimposition of the RF components on the DC components is &tgr; (when initial phase &agr;&equals;0&deg;). As it is obvious from the graph, a notch amount can be remarkably reduced by setting the timing of superimposition of the RF components on the DC components near the end of the OFF period of the &mgr; wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The plasma density thins in such timing, which results in small amount of electrons. That is, when there is no difference in power of the RF components, each electron has maximum power. Thus, it is possible to obtain the most remarkable effect that the electrons are induced into the bottom portion of the pattern to offset charge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Though only the ECR etching apparatuses are explained in the aforementioned preferred embodiments, the application of the present invention is not only limited to those apparatuses. The present invention is also applicable to all kinds of etching apparatuses for generating plasma separately from an RF power applied to a sample (e.g. etching apparatus using an induced coupled plasma, called as &ldquo;ICP&rdquo;). It is needless to say that control of the frequency of the RF power and a voltage is effective in controlling an ion energy and a notch amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is understood that numerous other modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
