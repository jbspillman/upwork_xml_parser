<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having thin film transistors (TFTs) fabricated on an insulated substrate. It also relates to a semiconductor device having thin film transistors. Particularly, the present invention relates to an active matrix type semiconductor display. It also relates to a driving circuit of an active matrix semiconductor display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Techniques for fabricating thin film transistors (TFTs) by forming a semiconductor thin film on an inexpensive glass substrate have recently been under rapid development. The reason is increasing demands for active matrix liquid crystal displays (liquid crystal panels). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On an active matrix liquid crystal panel, a pixel TFT is provided in each of pixel regions in a large quantity in the range from several hundreds of thousands to several millions provided in the form of a matrix as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> (such a circuit is referred to as &ldquo;active matrix circuit&rdquo;). A switching element is provided for each pixel, and pixel information is controlled by turning the switching elements on and off. Liquid crystal is of used as a display medium of such a display. Particularly, elements having three terminals, i.e., thin film transistors (TFTs) having a gate, a source and a drain are used as the switching elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An active matrix circuit comprises thin film transistors made of amorphous silicon or polysilicon formed on a glass substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Active matrix liquid crystal displays have recently been provided in which a quartz substrate is used and thin film transistors are formed by a polycrystalline silicon film. In this case, peripheral driving circuits for driving pixel TFTs can be also formed on the same substrate on which the active matrix circuit is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A technique is also known which utilize processes such as laser annealing to fabricate thin film transistors on a glass substrate using a polycrystalline silicon film. The use of this technique allows the integration of an active matrix circuit and peripheral driving circuits on a glass substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the context of the present invention, a row of a matrix is associated with a thin film transistor whose gate electrode is connected to a scan line (gate line) provided in parallel with the row, and a column is associated with a thin film transistor whose source (or drain) electrode is connected to a signal line (source line) provided in parallel with the column. A circuit for driving scan lines is referred to as &ldquo;scan line driving circuit&rdquo;, and a circuit for driving signal lines is referred to as &ldquo;scan line driving circuit&rdquo;. A thin film transistor is referred to as &ldquo;TFT&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A back gate electrode is a pair of electrodes which are formed on a bottom side of a thin film transistor having a top gate type structure, i.e., formed toward the substrate and which are alternatively formed on a top side in case of a thin film transistor having a bottom gate type structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</cross-reference> show a first example of conventional active matrix liquid crystal displays. In the active matrix liquid crystal display in this example, the thin film transistors made of amorphous silicon are used; the scan line driving circuit and signal line driving circuit are formed by integrated circuits <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> made of single crystal; and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> represents an active matrix circuit which is mounted to the periphery of a glass substrate using tabs (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</cross-reference>) or mounted using the COG (chip on glass) technique (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Such a liquid crystal display has had problems as described below. One problem has been the fact that problems with reliability can occur because the signal lines and scan lines of the active matrix are connected via tabs or bonding wires. For example, in the case VGA (video graphics array) type liquid crystal displays, there are 1920 signal lines and 480 scan lines, and those numbers of lines tend to increase as resolution is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> To fabricate a view finer used in a video camera or a projector utilizing liquid crystal, the display must be made compact, and a liquid crystal display with tabs has been disadvantageous from the viewpoint of space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In order to solve those problems, active matrix liquid crystal displays have been developed in which the thin film transistors are formed from polysilicon. An example is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A and 35B</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A, a</cross-reference> signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and a scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> are formed on a glass substrate using polysilicon thin film transistors along with pixel thin film transistors to form an active matrix circuit. The formation of the polysilicon thin film transistors involves a high temperature polysilicon process in which processing is performed at 1000&deg; C. or more on a quartz substrate to form the elements thereon or a low temperature polysilicon process in which processing is performed at 600&deg; C. or less on a glass substrate to form the elements thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The mobility of a polysilicon thin film transistor can be 30 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vsec. or more which enables an operation on a signal on the order of a few MHz, whereas the mobility of an amorphous thin film transistor is on the order of 0.5 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vsec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> There are digital type and analog type driving circuits for driving active matrix liquid crystal displays. The analog type is commonly used in a driving circuit utilizing polysilicon because the digital type includes a significantly greater number of circuit elements than those in the analog type. Circuit configurations utilizing a shift register are commonly used for scan line driving circuits and signal line driving circuits (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</cross-reference>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>B, DFF represents a delay flip-flop which operates in synchronism with a pulse applied to a clock terminal. When a start pulse HI is input to the DFF at the first stage, it outputs HI in synchronism with the clock, and the output is transferred to the second, third, - - - , N-th stages, which results in an operation of a shift register having N stages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Recently, active matrix liquid crystal displays are widely used in notebook type personal computers. A personal computer requires a multiple tone liquid crystal display when a plurality of programs are activated simultaneously and when images from a digital camera are imported and processed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further, the recent spread of personal digital assistants, mobile computers, car navigation systems and the like has resulted in a need for compact active matrix liquid crystal displays with high fineness, resolution and image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Compact projectors with high fineness, resolution and image quality utilizing an active matrix liquid crystal display are also attracting attention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Obviously, TFTs forming a part of an active matrix liquid crystal display used for applications as described above must have high performance. When a TFT is discussed from the aspect of performance, reference is made to the mobility, threshold voltage and the like. Especially, there are considerably severe performance requirements on a threshold voltage. That is, a shift of a threshold voltage can result in malfunction of a driving circuit and pixel electrodes, which often makes it impossible to obtain a preferable image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A conventional liquid crystal display as described above has had the following problems. It has been generally difficult to control the threshold voltage of a thin film transistor utilizing polysilicon when compared to a single crystal transistor, and this has sometimes put a transistor intended for the enhancement mode in the depression mode in which a current flows to the drain even when the gate-source voltage is 0. The reasons for this include the fact that it is less uniform compared to single crystal, the fact that a thermal oxide film can not be used as a gate oxide film in the case of low temperature polysilicon utilizing an inexpensive glass substrate because of the low heat-resisting properties of the glass substrate, and contamination with impurities from a glass substrate and fixed charges of an underlying film or the like formed to prevent contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A and 36B</cross-reference> show gate voltage-drain current characteristics (Vg-Id curve) of a TFT. Let us assume that the thin film transistor which must have the characteristics shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</cross-reference> actually has the characteristics shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</cross-reference> because of a shift of the threshold. Then, no current flows in the inverter circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> when the input at the first stage is in a high state, whereas a current flows from the power supply to GND when the input is in a low state. At the next stage, a current conversely flows when the input is in the high state. When driving circuits of an active matrix liquid crystal display are provided as thin film transistors incorporated in a substrate, the stages at the signal side and scan side total at 2400 in the case of a VGA. This results in a high total current, although the current of each individual thin film is low. A significant problem has thus arisen from the viewpoint of reduction of power consumption of a display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When the thin film transistors have an excessively great threshold voltage, the on current of the same becomes small, which has resulted in a problem in that the operating frequency of the driving circuits is decreased. Since load capacitance is driven by the on current of the thin film transistors, the operating frequency of the driving circuits is determined by the magnitude of the on current when the load capacitance and the power supply voltage are constant. Therefore, an excessively great threshold has resulted in a reduction of the operating frequency. Further, the trend toward more compact displays has resulted in a need for reduction of the size of driving circuits (reduction of the size of thin film transistors). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been conceived taking the above-described problems with the prior art, and it is an object of the invention to control the threshold of thin film transistors by applying a voltage to the back gate electrodes, thereby reducing the power consumption of driving circuits and improving the operating frequency of the driving circuits. It is another object to reduce the size of thin film transistors by extracting a high current. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> A mode for carrying out the invention will now be described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, 101</cross-reference> represents a substrate which is an insulated substrate such as a glass substrate or quartz substrate; <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> represents an underlying film; <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> represent back gate electrodes; <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> represents a first gate insulation film; <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> represent semiconductor active layers comprising a source region, a drain region, a low concentration impurity region and a channel formation region; <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> represent second gate insulation films; <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> represent source electrodes; <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> represents a drain electrode; <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> represent gate electrodes; and <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> represents a layer insulation film. The design allows an arbitrary voltage to be applied to the back gate electrodes <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> The invention is an example of the use of an active matrix display as the semiconductor device. An active matrix liquid crystal display will be particularly described as an example. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the active matrix liquid crystal display. In the active matrix liquid crystal display in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> pixel portion is provided in the form of a matrix, and there is provided a signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> for driving signal lines to supply a display signal to the pixel portion and a scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for driving scan lines to supply a scan signal. The signal line driving circuit is constituted by a plurality of first thin film transistors. The scan line driving circuit is constituted by a plurality of second thin film transistors. A threshold control circuit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> for controlling the thresholds of the thin film transistors is connected to the signal line driving circuit and scan line driving circuit. The threshold control circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> commonly controls the plurality of first transistors forming the signal line driving circuit and the plurality of second thin film transistors forming the scan line driving circuit. According to the invention, the threshold control circuit controls the thresholds of the plurality of first thin film transistors and the plurality of second thin film transistors to reduce power consumption of the signal line driving circuit and scan line driving circuit or to improve the operating frequency thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> A thin film transistor is equipped with a control terminal for controlling the threshold. The threshold control circuit applies a desired voltage to the control terminal. Specifically, the control terminal is formed as a so-called back gate electrode opposite to the gate electrode of the thin film transistor to serve as a terminal for controlling the threshold. By applying the desired voltage to this control terminal from the threshold control circuit, the channel is varied to change the threshold. &ldquo;Back gate electrode&rdquo; is a generic term representing any electrode formed opposite to the gate electrodes (top gate electrodes and bottom gate electrodes) of thin film transistors. It is formed at the bottom side or substrate side of a thin film transistor having a top gate structure or formed at the top side of a thin film transistor having a bottom gate structure. When a voltage is applied to the control terminal by the threshold control circuit in such a configuration, it affects the channel of the thin film transistor. This makes it possible to control the threshold of the thin film transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In this case, different voltages are to be applied to when the power consumption of a dc is to be reduced and when the operating frequency of the same is to be improved. Further, the applied voltage varies depending on the polarity of the thin film transistor. Specifically, in the case of an n-type thin film transistor, a voltage lower than a ground potential is applied to reduce power consumption and a voltage higher than the ground potential is applied to improve the operating frequency. In the case of a p-type thin film transistor, a voltage higher than a power supply potential is applied to reduce power consumption and a voltage lower than the power supply potential is applied to improve the operating frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Thresholds may be controlled by monitoring the current through the dc or the current through individual thin film transistor. Alternatively, it may be automatically carried out by performing negative feedback. In the former case, a variable resistor is provided in the threshold control circuit, and a desired voltage is applied by adjusting the variable resistor. In the latter case, the threshold control circuit may be formed by a monitoring thin film transistor for setting a reference value, a load for converting a current through the monitoring thin film transistor into a voltage and an amplifier for amplifying the voltage generated at the load to apply it to the driving circuit and to negatively feed back it to a threshold control terminal of the monitoring thin film transistor. In the latter case, the threshold control circuit is preferably formed using a thin film transistor on the same substrate on which the driving circuit is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> When a thin film transistor is constituted by a complementary transistor (CMOS), first and second control terminals may be respectively provided on the n-type transistor and p-type transistor, and a desired voltage may be applied by the threshold control circuit to each of the first and second control terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The driving circuit includes a signal line driving circuit for driving signal lines and a scan line driving circuit for driving scan lines. In this case, a single threshold control circuit may be connected to those driving circuits to control the threshold of each thin film transistor commonly. A separate threshold control circuit may be connected to each driving circuit to control the threshold of each thin film transistor independently. Especially, in the latter case, it is possible to control the signal line driving circuit for reduced power consumption with a first threshold control circuit and to control the scan line driving circuit to improve the operating frequency with a second threshold control circuit. The reason for such independent control is the fact that the signal line driving circuit and scan line driving circuit have different operating frequencies. That is, the operating frequency is more important in the signal line driving circuit, and power consumption is more important for the scan line driving circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a thin film transistor having a back gate electrode according to the invention in the form of a plan view. <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> represents the back gate electrode. <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> represents an island-shaped region of polysilicon (active layer); <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> represents a gate electrode; <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> represent contact holes; and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> represents a wiring electrode. The threshold of the thin film transistor is controlled by applying a voltage to the back gate electrode <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> formed opposite to the gate electrode <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The electrical characteristics of the thin film transistor having such a configuration will be described with reference to an example. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</cross-reference> show examples of gate voltage-drain current characteristics (Vg-Id curves) of an n-channel thin film transistor and a p-channel thin film transistor. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A, 1601</cross-reference> represents the characteristics of the n-channel thin film transistor observed when no voltage is applied to the back gate electrode. The n-channel thin film transistor in this example is normally on. <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight> represent the characteristics of the n-channel thin film transistor, when positive voltage of &plus;2 V and &plus;5 V are respectively applied to the back gate electrode, and <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1605</bold></highlight> represent those when negative voltages of &minus;2 V and &minus;5 V are respectively applied to the back gate electrode. Specifically, the threshold of the n-channel thin film transistor is shifted to the left (in the negative direction) when a positive voltage is applied to the back gate electrode and is shifted to the right (in the positive direction) when a negative voltage is applied. Those curves indicate that the threshold voltage of an n-channel TFT can be changed by applying a positive or negative voltage to the back gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</cross-reference> shows the characteristics of a p-channel thin film transistor. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B, 1611</cross-reference> represents the characteristics of the p-channel thin film transistor observed when no voltage is applied to the back gate electrode. <highlight><bold>1614</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1615</bold></highlight> represent the characteristics of the p-channel thin film transistor observed respectively when positive voltages of &plus;2 V and &plus;5 V are applied to the back gate electrode, and <highlight><bold>1612</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1613</bold></highlight> represent the characteristics of the p-channel thin film transistor observed when negative voltages &minus;2 V and &minus;5 V are applied to the back gate electrode. Specifically, the threshold of the p-channel thin film transistor is shifted to the left (in the negative direction) when a positive voltage is applied to the back gate electrode and is shifted to the right (in the positive direction) when a negative voltage is applied. Those curves indicate that the threshold voltage of a p-channel thin film transistor can be changed by applying a positive or negative voltage to the back gate electrode similarly to the case of an n-channel TFT as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</cross-reference> show only characteristics observed when the back gate voltage is at positive voltages of &plus;2 V and &plus;5 V and negative voltages of &minus;2 V and &minus;5 V. The inventor measured similar characteristics (Vg-Id curves) of thin film transistors with the back gate voltages varied more minutely and found that the threshold Vth of each of a n-channel thin film transistor and a p-channel thin film transistor changed as plotted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</cross-reference> as the back gate voltage was changed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</cross-reference> show the characteristics of the n-channel thin film transistor and p-channel thin film transistor, respectively. The threshold of either of the n-channel and p-channel thin film transistors is shifted in the negative direction when a positive voltage is applied to the back gate voltage and is shifted in the positive direction when a negative voltage is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> This has revealed that the threshold voltage of each of the n-channel and p-channel thin film transistor can be changed by applying a voltage to the back gate electrode. The invention takes advantage of this phenomenon to control the threshold voltage Vth of a thin film transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> A description will be made further based on characteristics of thin film transistors as described above on the application of the invention to several basic circuits and the operation of the same. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an inverter array as an example of a basic circuit that constitutes a driving circuit. Although an inverter is described as an example, the description applies not only to inverters but also to shift registers, decoders and the like. While a CMOS inverter circuit normally comprises four terminals, i.e., input (IN), output (OUT), power supply (Vdd) and ground terminals, a threshold control terminal for an n-channel thin film transistor and a threshold control terminal for a p-channel thin film transistor are added to provide six terminals according to the invention. A back gate voltage V<highlight><subscript>BGP </subscript></highlight>is applied from the p-channel TFT threshold control terminal to the p-channel thin film transistor, and a back gate voltage V<highlight><subscript>BGN </subscript></highlight>is applied from the n-channel TFT threshold control terminal to the n-channel thin film transistor.

<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> A threshold voltage at which the NAND circuit is activated can be changed by applying the back gate voltages to those thin film transistors. </paragraph>

In the examples, since the control voltage does not change as time passes, a required voltage may be applied using a voltage source <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>) or using a variable resistor <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>). In the examples, control over a threshold is optimized by setting the voltage while monitoring a current through a driving circuit or a current through each individual thin film transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, both of a signal line driving circuit and a scan line driving circuit of an active matrix liquid crystal display incorporate threshold control circuits associated therewith. In this example, the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is employed for a plurality of first thin film transistors forming a signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and a plurality of second thin film transistors forming a scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>. The plurality of first thin film transistors forming the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and the plurality of second thin film transistors forming the scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> are independently controlled. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, threshold control terminals of the plurality of first thin film transistors forming the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and the plurality of second thin film transistors forming the scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> (the back gate electrode <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) are led out, and voltages are applied to the terminals of the back gate electrodes <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> thus led out to control the thresholds of the thin film transistors. As described above, when it is desired to reduce power consumption of the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> as a measure to cope with the normally on state of the thin film transistors, the threshold voltages can be controlled by applying a voltage lower than a ground potential to the threshold control terminals of n-channel thin film transistors and a voltage higher than a power supply potential to the threshold control terminals of p-channel thin film transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> When it is desirable to increase the operating frequencies of the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, the thresholds are controlled by applying a voltage higher than the ground potential to the threshold control terminals of n-channel thin film transistors and a voltage lower than the power supply potential to the threshold control terminals of p-channel thin film transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> While the threshold control voltages for the plurality of first thin film transistors forming the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and the plurality of second thin film transistors forming the scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> are independently controlled here, they may be commonly controlled depending on the area occupied by them. In general, the operating frequency of the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> is on the order of MHz, whereas the operating frequency of the scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> is on the order of KHz. It is therefore required to increase the operating frequency of the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, but there is no such need for the scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>. In controlling the thresholds, therefore, the operating frequency is more important for the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and power consumption is more important for the scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>. <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> represents a threshold control circuit for the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> represents a threshold control circuit for the scan line driving circuit <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>; and <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight> represents an active matrix liquid crystal display. A display module which is an advanced version of this configuration in the form of a panel unit will be disclosed later as an eighth embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> threshold control circuit is configured using a thin film transistor on the same substrate on which a driving circuit is provided instead of an external variable resistor or variable voltage source. In this case, the circuit is formed by a monitoring thin film transistor <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> to serve as a reference for control, a load <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> for converting a current through the monitoring thin film transistor <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> into a voltage and an amplifier <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> for amplifying the voltage generated at the load <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> and for applying the voltage to the driving circuit and a threshold control terminal of the monitoring thin film transistor <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The operation of the same will be described. When this thin film transistor <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> is normally on, a drain current flows through the monitoring thin film transistor <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> to generate a voltage at the load <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>. This voltage is input to a non-inverting input terminal of the amplifier <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> on a differential input basis, and a differential voltage between the voltage at the load <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> and a reference voltage <highlight><bold>1403</bold></highlight> is amplified and output. The amplified differential voltage output is output in a decreasing direction because of non-inverting input is adopted. The output of the amplifier <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> is connected to the monitoring thin film transistor <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> and a voltage control terminal of the driving circuit. Further, since the voltage is decreased, the voltage at the threshold control terminal is decreased to increase the threshold of the thin film transistor, causing the thin film transistor to operate in the direction of suppressing the drain current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Thus, the threshold can be automatically controlled by providing negative feedback with the combination of the monitoring thin film transistor <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> and amplifier <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> While a feedback circuit is configured as described above on a normally on basis, the threshold can be freely set by fixing the gate voltage of the monitoring thin film transistor <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> at a potential other than the source potential and setting the reference voltage appropriately. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> A specific description will now be made on semiconductor devices according to the invention with reference to the following embodiments. The following embodiments are merely limited modes of carrying out the invention, and the semiconductor device and semiconductor display according to the invention are not limited to the following embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment will refer to an active matrix liquid crystal display as an example of a semiconductor display having a structure of a semiconductor device according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is an example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11D</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A through 12D</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A through 13D</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A through 14C</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</cross-reference> in which a plurality of TFTs having a structure according to the invention are formed on a substrate having an insulated surface and in which a pixel matrix circuit, driving circuits, a logic circuit and the like are configured, on a monolithic basis. The present embodiment describes the simultaneous formation of one pixel of the pixel matrix circuit and CMOS circuits which are basic circuits for the other circuits (the driving circuits, logic circuit and the like). While the present embodiment further refers to steps for fabricating a p-channel TFT and an n-channel TFT each having one gate electrode, it is possible to fabricate CMOS circuits utilizing TFTs having a plurality of gate electrodes such as double gate type and triple gate type TFTs in a similar manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A, a</cross-reference> quartz substrate <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is first prepared as the substrate having an insulated surface. A silicon substrate having a thermal oxide film formed thereon may be used instead of the quartz substrate. Alternatively, a method may be adopted in which an amorphous silicon film is once formed on the quartz substrate and is completely thermally oxidized to provide an insulation film. Further, it is possible to use a quartz substrate, ceramic substrate or silicon substrate having a silicon nitride film formed thereon as an insulation film. Next, an underlying later <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is formed. In the present embodiment, SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, back gate electrodes <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> are formed next. In this embodiment, Ta is used for the back gate electrodes <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Ta may be replaced by a multi-layer film of Ta and TaN or a metal having a high melting point such as Ti or a multi-layer film made of a plurality of metals. Then, a first gate insulation film <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is formed. SiO2 of 70 nm is used as the first gate insulation film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, an amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is then formed. The amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is adjusted such that it has a final thickness (a thickness that takes a reduction attributable to thermal oxidation into account) in the range from 10 to 75 nm (preferably in the range from 15 to 45 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> During the formation of the amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, it is important to conduct severe control of the concentration of impurities in the film. In the present embodiment, the amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is controlled such that both of C (carbon) and N (nitrogen) which are impurities hindering subsequent crystallization have a concentration less than 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>(typically 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>or less and preferably 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>or less) and such that O (oxygen) has a concentration less than 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>(typically 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>or less and preferably 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>or less). The reason is that the presence of each impurity with a concentration higher than that described above can affect subsequent crystallization to reduce the quality of a crystallized film. In the context of this specification, the concentrations of the above described impurities in a film are defined in terms of minimum values measured by SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> In order to provide the above-described configuration, a low pressure thermal CVD furnace used for the invention is preferably subjected to periodic dry cleaning to keep a film forming chamber clean. The dry cleaning of the film forming chamber may be carried out by introducing a ClF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(chlorine fluoride) gas in the range from 100 to 300 sccm into the furnace heated to a temperature in the range from 200 to 400&deg; C. and by cleaning the film forming chamber with fluorine generated as a result of thermal decomposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> According to the findings of the applicant, any deposit having a thickness of about 2 &mgr;m (major component of which is silicon) can be completely removed in four hours when the temperature inside the furnace is 300&deg; C. and the flow rate of the ClF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas is 300 sccm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Another very important parameter is the concentration of hydrogen in the amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, and it seems that a low hydrogen content results in a film having high crystallinity. Therefore, the amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is preferably formed using a low pressure thermal CVD process. A plasma CVD process may alternatively be used by optimizing conditions for film formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Next, a step of crystallizing the amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is carried out. A technique disclosed in JP-A-7-130652 is used as means for crystallization. While either of the means disclosed in the first and second embodiment in the same publication may be used, the technique disclosed in the second embodiment of the publication (which is described in more detail in JP-A-8-78329) is preferably used in the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> According to the technique disclosed in the JP-A-8-78329, a mask insulation film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness of 100 nm to select regions to be doped with a catalytic element. The mask insulation film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> has a plurality of openings to allow doping with a catalytic element. The positions of crystalline regions can be determined by the positions of the openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D, a</cross-reference> solution including nickel (Ni) as a catalytic element for promoting the crystallization of the amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> (a nickel ethanol acetate solution) is applied using a spin coating process. Usable catalytic elements other than nickel include cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), palladium (Pd), germanium (Ge), platinum (Pt), copper (Cu) and gold (Au). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The step of doping with a catalytic element may be performed through an ion implantation process utilizing a resist mask or a plasma doping process. In this case, since it is easy to reduce the area occupied by doped regions and to control the growing distance of laterally grown regions, it is a technique effective in forming a fine circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, after the step of doping with a catalytic element, dehydration is carried out for about one hour at 450&deg; C. and, the amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is thereafter crystallized through a heating process for a duration in the range from 4 to 24 hours at a temperature in the range from 500 to 960&deg; C. (typically in the range from 550 to 650&deg; C.) in an inert atmosphere, hydrogen atmosphere or oxygen atmosphere. In the present embodiment, the heating process is carried out for 14 hours at 570&deg; C. in a nitrogen atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> At this time, the crystallization of the amorphous silicon film <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> proceeds with precedence to nuclei generated in regions <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> doped with nickel to form crystalline regions <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> constituted by polycrystalline silicon films grown substantially in parallel with the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The crystalline regions <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are referred to as &ldquo;laterally grown regions&rdquo;. The laterally grown regions are advantageous in that they have high crystallinity as a whole because individual crystals are aggregated in a relatively uniform state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> The use of the technique disclosed in an embodiment in the JP-A-7-130652 also forms regions which can be microscopically regarded as laterally grown regions. However, this technique has a problem with controllability of gain boundaries because nuclei are ununiformly generated in a plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Crystallization can be caused by applying a nickel acetate solution on the top surface of the amorphous silicon film without using the mask insulation film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B, a</cross-reference> process of gettering the catalytic element is then performed. First, selective doping with phosphorus ions is carried out. The doping with phosphorus is performed with the mask insulation film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> formed. Then, only regions <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of the polycrystalline silicon film uncovered with the mask insulation film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> are doped with phosphorus (those regions are referred to as &ldquo;phosphorus-doped regions <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>&rdquo;). At this time, a voltage to accelerate doping and the thickness of the mask constituted by an oxide film are optimized to prevent phosphorus from substantially penetrating through the mask insulation film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Although it is not essential that the mask insulation film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is an oxide film, an oxide film is preferable because it does not contaminate an active layer even if it is in direct contact therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> The dose of phosphorus is preferably in the range from about 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>to about 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>ions/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. In this embodiment, 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>ions/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>were dosed with an ion doping apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The acceleration voltage for the ion doping was 10 kV. An acceleration voltage of 10 kV substantially prevents phosphorus from passing through an oxide mask of 1000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C, thermal annealing is then carried out for a duration in the range from one to 12 hours (12 hours in this embodiment) in a nitrogen atmosphere at 600&deg; C. to getter nickel elements. As indicated by the arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C, this causes nickel to be attracted by phosphorus. At a temperature of 600&deg; C., while substantially no phosphorus atom moves in the film, nickel atoms can move a distance of about 100 &mgr;m or more. This indicates that phosphorus is one of the most suitable elements for gettering nickel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Then, the polycrystalline silicon film is patterned. This is carried out to eliminate the phosphorus-doped regions <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, i.e., the regions from which nickel has been gettered. Thus, active layers <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> constituted by polycrystalline silicon films including substantially no nickel element are provided. The active layers <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> constituted by polycrystalline silicon films thus obtained will serve as active layers of TFTs later (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> When the active layers <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> are formed, a second gate insulation film constituted by an insulation film including silicon is formed on them. A heating process is then carried out at a temperature in the range from 800 to 1100&deg; C. (preferably in the range from 950 to 1050&deg; C.) in an oxidized atmosphere to form thermal oxide films (not shown) at the boundaries between the active layer and the first gate insulation film and between the active layer and the second gate insulation film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The heating process to getter the catalytic element (catalytic element gettering process) may be carried out at this stage. In this case, a halogen is included in the processing atmosphere of the heating process to take advantage of the effect of the halogen to getter metal elements. In order to sufficiently utilize the gettering effect of the halogen, the heating process is performed at a temperature higher than 700&deg; C. At a temperature lower than this, halides are difficult to decompose in the processing atmosphere, which can disable the gettering effect. Typically, one or a plural kinds of gases selected from among compounds including a halogen such as Cl, HF, NF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, HBr, Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, ClF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, BCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and Br<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>may be used as gases including a halogen in this case. For example, when HCl is used at this step, it is assumed that nickel in the active layers is gettered by the action of chlorine to become volatile nickel chloride which escapes into the atmosphere to be removed. The process of gettering the catalytic element utilizing a halogen may be performed after the removal of the mask insulation film <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and before the patterning of the active layers. The catalytic element gettering process may be performed after the patterning of the active layers. Any combination of gettering process may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Next, a metal film mainly composed of aluminum (not shown) is formed and patterned to form an original form of gate electrodes to be described later. This embodiment uses an aluminum film including 2% of scandium by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Next, the technique disclosed in JP-A-7-135318 is used to form porous anodic oxide films <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, non-porous anodic oxide films <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and gate electrodes <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> When the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> is thus achieved, a second insulation film <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is etched using the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> and the porous anodic oxide films <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> as masks. Then, the porous anodic oxide films <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> are removed to achieve the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B, 330</cross-reference> through <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> represent second gate insulation films obtained after the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C, a</cross-reference> step of carried out to add an impurity element that provides one conductivity. As the impurity-element, P (phosphorus) or As (arsenic) may be used for an n-channel TFT and B (boron) or Ga (gallium) may be used for a p-channel TFT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the addition of impurities to form n-channel and p-channel TFTs is carried out at two separate steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> First, the impurity to form n-channel TFTs is added. The first step of adding an impurity (P (phosphorus) is used in this embodiment) is performed at a high acceleration voltage of about 80 keV to form n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> regions. The n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> regions are adjusted such that they have a P ion concentration in the range from 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Further, the second step of adding an impurity is performed at a low acceleration voltage of about 10 keV to form n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> regions. At this time, the gate insulation films serve as masks because the acceleration voltage is low. The n&plus; regions are adjusted such that they have a sheet resistance of 500 &OHgr; or less (preferably 300 &OHgr; or less). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> The above steps form a source region <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>, a drain region <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, a low concentration impurity region <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> and a channel formation region <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> of an n-channel TFT that forms a part of a CMOS circuit. They also define a source region <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight>, a drain region <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>, low concentration impurity region <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> and a channel formation region <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of an n-channel TFT that constitutes a pixel TFT (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> In the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>C, the active layer of a p-channel TFT that forms a part of the CMOS circuit has the same configuration as that of the active layer of the n-channel TFT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D, a</cross-reference> resist mask <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> is provided such that it covers the n-channel TFT to add impurity ions that provide the p-type properties (boron is used in this embodiment). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> This step is also separated into two sub-steps similarly to the impurity adding step described above. Since the n-channel type must be inverted into the p-channel type, B (boron) ions are added in a concentration several times higher than the above-described doping concentration of P ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> This forms a source region <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, a drain region <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight>, a low concentration impurity region <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> and a channel formation region <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> of a p-channel TFT that forms a part of the CMOS circuit (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> The impurity ions are then activated through a combination of furnace annealing, laser annealing, lamp annealing and the like. At the same time, damages on the active layers caused by the doping steps are recovered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A, a</cross-reference> multi-layer film comprising a silicon oxide film and a silicon nitride film is formed as a first layer insulation film <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>; contact holes are formed; and source and drain electrodes <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> are formed thereafter to achieve the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>. Organic resin may be used as the layer insulation film <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> When the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> is achieved, a second layer insulation film <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> constituted by an organic resin film is formed to a thickness in the range from 0.5 to 3 &mgr;m. Polyimide, acrylic, polyimideamide or the like is used as the organic resin film. Advantages of an organic resin film includes the facts that it can be easily formed; it can be easily formed with a great thickness; it allows a reduction of parasitic capacitance because of its low relative dielectric constant; and it has excellent planarity. Organic resin films of types other than that described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> A black matrix constituted by a light-blocking film may be used as the second layer insulation film <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. A titanium film, a resin film including a black pigment or the like may be used as the black matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> A contact hole is then formed in the second layer insulation film <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, and a pixel electrode <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness of 120 nm. A transparent conductive film such as an ITO is used as a conductive film that constitutes the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> because the present embodiment is an example of a transmission type active matrix liquid crystal display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Next, the substrate as a whole is heated for one to two hours in a hydrogen atmosphere at 350&deg; C. to hydrogenate the element as a whole, which compensates for dangling bonds in the films (especially in the active layers). A CMOS circuit and a pixel matrix circuit can be thus fabricated on the same substrate through the above steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> A description will now be made on steps for fabricating an active matrix liquid crystal display based on an active matrix substrate fabricated through the above steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> An alignment film <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> is formed on an active matrix substrate in the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, polyimide is used for the alignment film <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. Then, a counter substrate is prepared. The counter substrate is formed by a glass substrate <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, a transparent conductive film <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> and an alignment film <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, polyimide is used for the alignment film. A rubbing process is performed after the alignment film is formed. In this embodiment, polyimide having a relatively small pretilt angle is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> The active matrix substrate and counter substrate obtained through the above steps are put together with a sealing material and a spacer (both of which are not shown) interposed therebetween at a well-known cell assembly step. Thereafter, liquid crystal <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> is injected between those substrates and is completely sealed with a sealing agent (not shown). In this embodiment, nematic liquid crystal is used as the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> This completes a transmission type active matrix liquid crystal display as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Findings on Crystal Structure of Active Layer&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> An active layer formed through the above-described fabrication steps has a crystal structure in which a plurality of bar-shaped or planar bar-shaped crystals are aligned substantially in parallel with each other with regularity in a particular direction when viewed microscopically. This can be easily confirmed through observation using TEM (transmission electron microscopy). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</cross-reference> shows an HR-TEM photograph of a grain boundary between bar-shaped or planar bar-shaped crystals at a magnification of 8 millions. In the context of this specification, the term &ldquo;grain boundary&rdquo; is defined as a grain boundary formed at the boundary where bar-shaped or planar bar-shaped crystals are in contact with each other. Therefore, it is considered different from grain boundaries in a macroscopic sense such as those formed where laterally grown regions collide with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> The above-described HR-TEM (high resolution transmission electron microscopy) is a technique for evaluating atomic and molecular arrangements of a sample utilizing interference of transmitted electrons and elastically scattered electrons that occurs when an electron beams vertically impinges upon the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> HR-TEM allows an arrangement of crystal lattices to be observed as a lattice pattern. Therefore, the state of bonding between atoms at a grain boundary can be inferred through an observation of the grain boundary. While a lattice pattern appears as a pattern of white and black stripes, it represents a difference in contrast and does not indicate the positions of atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</cross-reference> shows a typical TEM photograph taken on a crystalline silicon film (laterally grown region) obtained according to the invention in which two different crystal grains contact with each other to form a grain boundary. At this time, the two crystal grains are substantially at a &lcub;110&rcub;-orientation relative to each other, although they have a slight shift of the crystal axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> As will be described later, as a result of an examination on a plurality of crystal grains, it was found that most of them were substantially at the &lcub;110&rcub;-orientation from X-ray diffraction or electron beam diffraction. Although it is assumed that (011)-planes and (200)-planes should be included when a multiplicity of crystal grains are observed, such equivalent planes are collectively referred to as &ldquo;&lcub;110&rcub;-planes&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A, a</cross-reference> lattice pattern associated with a &lcub;111&rcub;-plane is observed in the plane. A lattice pattern associated with a &lcub;111&rcub;-plane is a lattice pattern which reveals a &lcub;111&rcub;-plane in a section of the crystal grain when it is cut along the lattice pattern. The association between a lattice pattern and a plane can be simply identified from the intervals between lattice patterns, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The difference in the appearance of lattice patterns in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</cross-reference> is attributable to slight differences between the inclinations of the crystal grains. Specifically, their lattice patterns appear differently because when an electron beam is set to vertical impinge upon the crystal face of one of the crystal grain, the electron beam impinges upon the other crystal grain at a slight angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> The lattice pattern associated with a &lcub;111&rcub;-plane will now be discussed. The lattice pattern associated with a &lcub;111&rcub;-plane of the crystal grain that appears in white in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</cross-reference> (upper side) intersects with the lattice pattern associated with a &lcub;111&rcub;-plane of the crystal grain that appears in black (lower side) at an angle of about 70&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Such a crystal structure (strictly, a structure of a grain boundary) indicates that the two different crystal grains are bonded with each other at the grain boundary at a very high level of matching. Specifically, the crystal lattices are continuous at the grain boundary, which scarcely results in any trap level attributable to a lattice defect or the like. In other words, the crystal lattices are continuous at the grain boundary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</cross-reference> shows an HR-TEM photograph of a conventional polysilicon film as a reference. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>B, the crystal face has no regularity as described later, and the orientation is not dominated by &lcub;110&rcub;-planes. However, an observation is made here on crystal grains on which lattice patterns associated with &lcub;111&rcub;-planes appear for comparison with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> A close observation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</cross-reference> reveals many locations at the grain boundary where the lattice patterns are discontinuous. In such locations, dangling bonds (which can be regarded as lattice defects) exist which are highly likely to act as trap levels to hinder the movement of carriers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Dangling bonds as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</cross-reference> also certainly exist in a crystalline silicon film obtained according to the fabrication method of the present embodiment, which is unavoidable because the crystalline silicon film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment is polycrystalline. However, a close TEM observation over a wide range of the crystalline silicon film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment has revealed that substantially no dangling bond as described above exist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> As far as the applicant has studied, continuity of crystal lattices was observed 90% (typically 95%) or more of grain boundaries, and substantially no dangling bond as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</cross-reference> was observed. This also indicates that the crystalline silicon film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment can be regarded as a semiconductor film different from conventional high temperature polysilicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A and 39B</cross-reference> show the results of an examination utilizing electron beam diffraction on a crystalline silicon film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</cross-reference> shows a typical electron beam diffraction pattern on the crystalline silicon film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39B</cross-reference> shows a typical electron beam diffraction pattern on a conventional high temperature polysilicon film as a reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> The measurement illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A and 39B</cross-reference> can be regarded as a collection of information in a macroscopic region unlike that available from the levels of lattice patterns because the spots irradiated by electron beams had a diameter of about 1.5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</cross-reference> relatively clearly shows diffraction spots associated with &lt;110&gt; incidence and indicates that the crystal axis is a &lt;110&gt;-axis (i.e., the crystal face is a &lcub;110&rcub;-plane). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Each of the spots slightly spreads in the form of a concentric circle, and this is assumed to be attributable to a certain degree of distribution of rotational angle around the crystal axis. The degree of the spread is estimated at 5&deg; or less from the pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> The electron beam diffraction pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39B</cross-reference> indicates no clear regularity of the diffraction spots and indicates that the spots are at substantially random orientations. That is, it is expected that crystals at plane orientations other than &lcub;110&rcub;-planes irregularly exist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> As apparent from those results, almost all of the crystal grains of the crystalline silicon film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment are substantially oriented along &lcub;110&rcub;-planes. The electron beam diffraction pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</cross-reference> can be achieved only when 70% or more (preferably 90% or more) of crystal grains are oriented along &lcub;110&rcub;-planes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> The inventors caused X-ray diffraction according to the technique disclosed in JP-A-7-321339 to calculate the orientation ratio of the crystalline silicon film of this embodiment. According to the publication, an orientation ratio is defined based on a calculation method as expressed by Equation 1 below.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> As a result of the X-ray diffraction, peaks corresponding to &lcub;220&rcub; (which are obviously equivalent to &lcub;110&rcub;-planes) appeared with the highest intensity, which indicated that &lcub;110&rcub;-planes are obviously in the major orientation and that the orientation ratio is 0.7 or more (typically 0.9 or more). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> It is apparent from the above that the crystalline silicon film according to the invention and the conventional polysilicon film have completely different crystal structures (crystal configurations). The crystalline silicon film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment can be regarded as a quite novel semiconductor film in this respect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> The applicant refers to a crystalline silicon film according to the invention having the crystal structure and features as described above as &ldquo;continuous grain silicon: CGS)&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> When a semiconductor thin film is formed, it is very much advantageous to perform an annealing step at a temperature equal to or higher than a crystallizing temperature as in the present embodiment in reducing defects in the crystal grains, which will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</cross-reference> shows a TEM photograph at a magnification of one million on a crystalline silicon film fabricated according to this embodiment. Substantially no defect attributable to a stacking fault or dislocation is seen in the crystal grains, which indicates very high crystallinity. This equally applies to the entire surface of the film, and it is possible to reduce the number of defects to a Degree that can be substantially regarded zero, although it is presently difficult to reduce the number of defects to zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Specifically, defects in the crystal grains of the crystalline silicon film shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</cross-reference> have been reduced to a substantially negligible degree, and the film can be regarded monocrystalline or substantially monocrystalline because the grain boundaries can not act as barriers against carrier movement because of high continuity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40B</cross-reference> shows a TEM photograph at a magnification of one million on a crystalline silicon film which has been subjected to steps up to gettering. A multiplicity of defects as indicated by the arrows can be seen in the crystal grains (the black and white regions appear because of a difference in contrast). Such defects are primarily stacking faults that are disorder of stacking of atoms at silicon crystal lattice planes, although dislocation may be included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> As described above, the crystalline silicon films shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A and 40B</cross-reference> have substantially the same level of continuity at grain boundaries, but there is a significant difference between the numbers of defects in their crystal grains. Such a difference in the numbers of defects is a major reason for the fact that the crystalline silicon film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment has much higher electrical characteristics than those of the crystalline silicon film shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> This phenomenon considered attributable to the fact that extra silicon atoms generated during thermal oxidation of the crystalline silicon film move to defects to contribute to generation of Si&mdash;Si bonds significantly. This concept is known as a reason for the fact that a high temperature polysilicon film has a small number of defects in its crystal grains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> The applicant also has an idea of a model in which a heating process at a temperature exceeding a crystallizing temperature (typically in the range from 700 to 1100&deg; C.) is performed to rigidly secure a crystalline silicon film to an underlying film therefor to improve the tightness of the contact between them, thereby eliminating defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> There is a difference by a factor of ten between the thermal expansion coefficients of a crystalline silicon film and a silicon oxide film to serve as an underlying film. Therefore, when an amorphous silicon film has metamorphosed into a crystalline silicon film, the crystalline silicon film is subjected to a very great stress when it is cooled down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> The crystalline silicon film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</cross-reference>) is characterized in that it has a much smaller number of defects in the crystal grains than the crystalline silicon film before a heating process at a temperature equal to or higher than that required for the crystallizing step (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> The difference in the number of defects appears as a difference in spin density at electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis. Presently, it has been identified that the spin density of a crystalline silicon film fabricated according to the fabrication steps of the first embodiment is at least 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>spins/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>or less (preferably 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>spins/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>or less). However, this measurement is close to the detection limit of existing measuring apparatuses, and it is therefore expected that the actual spin density is lower than this. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> TFTs according to the fabrication method of this embodiment have electrical characteristics comparative to those of MOSFETs utilizing single crystal silicon. The following data were obtained from TFTs prototyped by the inventors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> (1) The sub-threshold coefficient that serves as an index of the switching performance of a TFT (quickness of switching between on/off operations) is as small as 60 to 100 mV/decade (typically 60 to 85 mV/decade) for both of an n-channel TFT and a p-channel TFT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> (2) The field effect mobility that serves as an index of the operating speed of a TFT is as high as 100 to 250 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs (typically 120 to 200 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs) for an n-channel TFT and as high as 80 to 200 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs (typically 100 to 150 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/Vs) for a p-channel TFT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> (3) The threshold voltage (Vth) that serves as an index of the driving voltage of a TFT is as low as &minus;0.5 to 1.5 V for an n-channel TFT and as low as &minus;1.5 to 0.5 V for a p-channel TFT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> It has been confirmed that the embodiment makes it possible to achieve quite excellent switching characteristics and high speed operation characteristics as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Findings on Circuit Characteristics&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> A description will now be made on the frequency characteristics of a ring oscillator utilizing TFTs fabricated using semiconductor thin films according the fabrication method of this embodiment. A ring oscillator is a circuit which is inverted circuits having a CMOS structure connected into a ring having an odd number of stages and which is used to obtain a delay time at each stage constituted by an inverter circuit. The configuration used in the experiment was as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> Number of Stages: nine </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> TFT Gate Insulation Film Thickness: 30 nm and 50 nm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> TFT Gate Length: 0.6 &mgr;m </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> As a result of an examination on the oscillation frequency of this ring oscillator, a maximum oscillation frequency of 1.04 GHz was achieved. A shift register which is one of TEGs of an LSI circuit was actually fabricated, and the operating frequency of the same was checked. As a result, an output pulse having an operating frequency of 100 MHz was obtained in a shift register circuit having 50 stages in which the gate insulation film thickness was 30 nm; the gate length was 0.6 &mgr;m; and the power supply voltage was 5 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> Such astonishing data taken on the ring oscillator and shift register indicate that a TFT according to the invention has performance comparative or superior to that of an IGFET utilizing single crystal silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Finding on Relationship Between TFT Characteristics and CGS&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> The excellent TFT characteristics and circuit characteristics described above are primarily attributable to the fact that a semiconductor thin film having continuity between the crystal lattices at the grain boundaries is used as the active layer of a TFT. The reason for this will be discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Continuity between crystal lattices at a grain boundary is attributable to the fact that the grain boundary is a boundary referred to as &ldquo;planar boundary&rdquo;. The definition of the term &ldquo;planar boundary&rdquo; in this specification follows the definition that appears in &ldquo;Characterization of High-Efficiency Cast-Si Solar Cell Wafers by MBIC Measurement&rdquo; by Ryuichi Shimokawa and Yutaka Hayashi, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics vol. 27, No. 5, pp. 751-758, 1988. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> According to the above-mentioned article, planar boundaries include &lcub;111&rcub; twin crystal boundaries, &lcub;111&rcub; stacking faults, &lcub;221&rcub; twin crystal boundaries and &lcub;221&rcub; twist boundaries. Such planar boundaries are characterized in that they are electrically inactive. Specifically, since they do not act as traps that hinder the movement of carriers in spite of the fact that they are grain boundaries, they can be substantially regarded absent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> Especially, a &lcub;111&rcub; twin crystal boundary is referred to as &ldquo;homologous boundary of &Sgr;3&rdquo;, and a &lcub;221&rcub; twin boundary is referred to as &ldquo;homologous boundary of &Sgr;9&rdquo;. A &Sgr;-value is a parameter that serves as an index of the degree of matching at a homologous grain boundary, and it is known that a grain boundary has a higher degree of matching, the smaller the &Sgr;-value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> As a result of a close observation using TEM conducted by the applicant on a semiconductor thin film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment, it was revealed that most grain boundaries (90% or more and typically 95% or more) are homologous boundaries of &Sgr;3, i.e., &lcub;111&rcub; twin crystal boundaries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> It is known that when both of two crystal grains have a plane orientation of &lcub;110&rcub; at a grain boundary formed between them, the grain boundary is a homologous boundary of &Sgr;3 if &thgr;&equals;70.5&deg; where &thgr; represents the angle of a lattice pattern corresponding to a &lcub;111&rcub;-plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Therefore, at the grain boundary shown in the TEM photograph in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>A, the lattice patterns of the adjoining crystal grains are continuous at an angle of about 70&deg;, and it can be therefore easily inferred that this grain boundary us a &lcub;111&rcub; twin crystal boundary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> A grain boundary corresponds to &Sgr;9 when &thgr;&equals;38.9&deg;, and other grain boundaries of this kind were also present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Such a homologous grain boundary is formed only between crystal grains having the same plane orientation. That is, such homologous grain boundaries can be formed over a wide range in a semiconductor thin film according to the invention because the plane orientations are substantially aligned at &lcub;110&rcub;. This feature can never be available in other polysilicon films having irregular plane orientations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</cross-reference> shows a TEM photograph (dark field image) at a magnification of 15,000 of a semiconductor thin film according to the fabrication method of this embodiment. While there are regions which appear in white and regions which appear in black, regions which appear in the same color have the same orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> What is to be noted on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> is the fact that regions which appear in white continuously gather at a considerable ratio to the dark field image having such a wide range. This means that crystal grains having the same orientation exist with a certain degree of directivity and that adjoining crystal grains have substantially the same orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</cross-reference> shows a TEM photograph (dark field image) at a magnification of 15,000 of a conventional high temperature polysilicon film. Regions having the same plane orientation are dispersed in the conventional high temperature polysilicon film in which no aggregation having directivity is observed unlike <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</cross-reference>. This is considered attributable to the fact that adjoining crystal grains have completely irregular orientations. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> The points <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> were observed under the same conditions as for the point <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44A, 44B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>C show the result of the observation of the point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45A, 45B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>C show the result of the observation of the point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> Those results of observation indicate that continuity between crystal lattices is maintained at any grain boundary to form a planar boundary. After repeated observation and measurement conducted on many regions other than the measuring points illustrated here, the applicant confirmed that continuity between crystal lattices at grain boundaries is maintained in a region wide enough to fabricate a TFT. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> which shows a semiconductor device according to the present embodiment. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16, 801</cross-reference> represents a substrate for which an insulated substrate such as a glass substrate or quartz substrate is used; <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> represents an underlying film; <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> represent back gate electrodes; <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> represents a first gate insulation film; <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight> represent semiconductor active layers comprising a source region, a drain region, a low concentration impurity region and a channel formation region; <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight> represent second gate insulation films; <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> represent source and drain electrodes; <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> represent gate electrodes; and <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> represents a layer insulation film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> The back gate electrodes <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> are-designed such that an arbitrary voltage can be applied thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device of the present embodiment, the configuration of the back gate electrodes <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> is different from that in the semiconductor device described above as a mode for carrying out the invention in that the back gate electrodes <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> are formed only under the channel formation regions of the active layers. The structure is otherwise is the same as the semiconductor device described above as a mode for carrying out the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor device of this embodiment can be fabricated by the fabrication method described in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> A fourth embodiment of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows an active matrix liquid crystal display as a semiconductor display according to the present embodiment. The semiconductor display according to this embodiment has a structure different from that of the semiconductor display of the first embodiment. Specifically, the back gate electrodes of pixel TFTs are larger than the active layers of the pixel TFTs and have a floating structure. This prevents light from impinging upon the pixel TFTs from the rear surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor display of this embodiment, the back gate electrodes have a configuration from that of the semiconductor device described above as a mode for carrying out the invention and are formed only under the channel formation regions of the active layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> The structure is otherwise the same as that of the semiconductor display of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> A fifth embodiment of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> According to the present embodiment, in a semiconductor device or semiconductor display as described in the first through fourth embodiments, not only the threshold voltages of TFTs are controlled to operate a circuit accurately, but also the threshold voltages of TFTs forming a circuit which is not operating are controlled to minimize the drain current when no voltage is applied to the gate electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> shows an Id-Vg curve of an n-channel TFT. <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> represents the characteristics of the n-channel TFT with no voltage applied to the back gate electrode thereof, and <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> represents the characteristics of the n-channel TFT with a negative voltage applied to the back gate electrode. In a state in which no voltage is applied to the back gate electrode, the total drain current is large when no voltage is applied to the gate electrode. If a negative voltage is applied to the back gate electrode, the threshold voltage is shifted to the right (in the positive direction). As a result, the total drain current that flows when no voltage is applied to the gate electrode becomes smaller than that in a state in which no voltage is applied to the back gate electrode. Therefore, power consumption can be reduced by applying a back gate voltage to TFTs forming a circuit which is not in operation to change the threshold voltages thereof. The threshold voltage of a p-channel TFT can be also changed similarly to reduce the total drain current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> shows a semiconductor device having a plurality of circuits. In such a case, a control circuit transmits a control signal (back gate voltage) to control the threshold voltages of the TFTs forming circuits <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and applies a back gate voltage to reduce the total drain current as described above to any circuit among the circuits <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is not in operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> A sixth embodiment of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> The present embodiment is an application of the invention to an active matrix liquid crystal display. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference> show an example of an active matrix liquid crystal display configured by forming a plurality of thin film transistors on a substrate having an insulated surface. The present embodiment represents simultaneous fabrication of one pixel of a pixel matrix circuit and a CMOS circuit which is a basic circuit of a driving circuit (logic circuit or the like). Although each of the illustrated p-channel and n-channel thin film transistors has one gate electrode, it is possible to similarly fabricate a CMOS circuit constituted by thin film transistors having a plurality of gate electrodes such as double gate type and triple gate type transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> Steps for fabricating the active matrix liquid crystal display of this embodiment will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference>. A film is formed on a glass substrate <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> and patterned to form a back gate electrode <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference> shows a patterned back gate electrode, a film thus formed may be used as it is to serve as a back gate electrode without patterning in consideration to reduction of the number of steps. The back gate electrode <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> may be made of a metal such as aluminum (Al), tantalum (Ta), tantalum nitride (TaN), titanium (Ti), titanium nitride (TiN), molybdenum (Mo) or tungsten (W) and silicon including an impurity. When a material having high resistance, the forming step preferably include patterning taking the load resistance into consideration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</cross-reference> shows a structure which is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference> except the size of the back gate electrode <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. When the back gate electrode <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> is larger than a gate electrode <highlight><bold>1707</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>B, load capacitance is formed by the back gate electrode <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, an underlying oxide film <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight> and active layer polysilicon <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> to reduce the speed of response. The structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</cross-reference> is therefore desirable where high speed response is required. The glass substrate <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> depends on the maximum temperature of the process. Quartz glass may be used for a high temperature process, and an inexpensive glass substrate other than quartz may be used for a low temperature process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> After forming a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight> as an underlying film, an a-Si film <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> is formed. At this time, the step preferably continuously forms the films without releasing the vacuum in order to reduce contamination of the underlying film <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight>. The a-Si film <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> thus formed is crystallized through a heating process and a laser process into polysilicon. Island-shaped regions of polysilicon are formed using photolithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> The surface of the active layer is treated with a rare hydrofluoric acid to remove any native oxide film thereon and, thereafter, a gate oxide film (silicon oxide film) <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> is formed. The gate oxide film <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> may be formed using any of techniques such as LPCVD, APCVD and plasma CVD. A gate electrode film is then formed and is subjected to anodization, photolithography and etching to be formed into a gate electrode <highlight><bold>1707</bold></highlight>. Next, the entire surface is doped with an n-type impurity (phosphorus (P), arsenic (As) or the like) to form n-type source and drain regions. No impurity enters the region directly under the gate electrode which is doped after the formation of the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> To fabricate a p-channel thin film transistor, the region of the n-channel thin film transistor is blocked with a resist mask which is patterned to form an opening at the region for the p-channel thin film transistor, and doping is conducted with a p-type impurity (boron (B) or the like) to invert the polarity of a channel contact region. While doping with an n-type impurity is followed by doping with a p-type impurity in this case, this order may be reversed. However, the concentration of the impurity implanted later must be higher to cause the polarity inversion. Specifically, a p-type impurity must have a concentration several times higher than an n-type impurity with which the entire surface is doped, and an n-type impurity must have a concentration several times higher than a p-type impurity with which the entire surface is doped. Thus, impurity-implanted regions <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight> are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> The implanted impurity is activated through a heating process or laser process. At the same time, damage on the active layer <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> caused at the implanting step is recovered. Next, first layer insulation films <highlight><bold>1708</bold></highlight> are formed, and contact holes are provided. A contact hole for the connection of the bottom gate is also formed simultaneously. The first layer insulation films <highlight><bold>1708</bold></highlight> may be formed using any technique. Further, they may be combined with a nitride film into a two-layer structure in consideration to the step coverage of a wiring metal film to be formed later. In addition, organic resin films may be used as the first layer insulation films <highlight><bold>1708</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> Next, a wiring metal film is formed and is subjected to photolithography and etching to form wiring electrodes (source-drain electrodes) <highlight><bold>1709</bold></highlight>. A hydrogenating process is finally performed in a hydrogen atmosphere to adjust the characteristics of the thin film transistors. This hydrogenating process terminates any dangling bond in the active layer silicon films with hydrogen to improve the characteristics of the thin film transistors. It also performs sintering to provide ohmic contact between the wiring metal and silicon films. The hydrogenation may be performed after activation. Thus, thin film transistors having a bottom gate electrode for controlling the threshold is fabricated. No step is needed to be added to the above steps as long as CMOS is intended, and elements can be formed in the same steps as those in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> A second layer insulation film <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight> constituted by an organic resin film is then formed to a thickness in the range from 0.5 to 3 &mgr;m. Polyimide, acrylic, polyimideamide or the like may be used as the organic resin film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> The second layer insulation film <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight> may be constituted by a black matrix having light-blocking properties. A titanium film or resin including a black pigment or the like may be used as the black matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> A contact hole is then formed in the second layer insulation film <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight> to form a pixel electrode <highlight><bold>1711</bold></highlight> with a thickness of 120 nm. In the case of a transmission type active matrix liquid crystal display, in general, an ITO film is used as a transparent conductive film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> While the substrate as a whole is subjected to a hydrogenating process in a hydrogen atmosphere at this point, the hydrogenating process described above to follow activation may be combined with this process in order to reduce the number of steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> Then, a polyimide alignment film <highlight><bold>1712</bold></highlight> is formed (polyimide having a relatively small pretilt angle is used in this embodiment); a rubbing process is performed; and a counter substrate <highlight><bold>1716</bold></highlight> is put together with a sealing material and a spacer interposed at a well-known cell assembly step. Thereafter, liquid crystal <highlight><bold>1713</bold></highlight> is injected between both substrates and is completely sealed with a sealing agent to complete an active matrix liquid crystal display having driving circuits as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. While nematic liquid crystal is injected in this embodiment, there is no limitation on the type of liquid crystal. The display mode is not limited to the TN mode, and other display modes may be used. <highlight><bold>1714</bold></highlight> represents an alignment film; <highlight><bold>1715</bold></highlight> represents a counter electrode; and <highlight><bold>1716</bold></highlight> represents a counter substrate. </paragraph>

In either of them, a threshold control terminal is connected to all of an inverter, an analog switch and a clocked inverter. Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference>, a threshold control terminal may be connected to a NAND circuit, an inverter, an analog switch and clocked inverter connected to an active matrix circuit, a threshold control terminal may be connected to any logic circuit (electronic circuit) other than those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> An eighth embodiment of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>

A positive voltage or negative voltage can be respectively applied to both of the gate voltage and back gate voltage of an n-channel thin film transistor or a p-channel thin film transistor to induce at both of the gate electrode and back gate electrode, thereby extracting a high current. This makes it possible to reduce the size of a TFT. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>B, separate signals having the same polarity may be input to the gate electrode and back gate electrode to extract an arbitrary current, to design a TFT in accordance therewith. </paragraph>

The method for fabricating the pixel thin film transistors (pixel switching elements) and the cell assembly step will not be described here in detail because any well-known technique may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25, 2400</cross-reference> represents a substrate having an insulated surface (a plastic substrate having a silicon oxide film provided thereon); <highlight><bold>2401</bold></highlight> represents a pixel matrix circuit; <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight> represents a scan line driving circuit; <highlight><bold>2403</bold></highlight> represents a signal line driving circuit; <highlight><bold>2430</bold></highlight> represents a counter substrate; <highlight><bold>2410</bold></highlight> represents an FPC (flexible printed circuit); and <highlight><bold>2420</bold></highlight> represents a logic circuit.

Obviously, an IC chip may be provided on the substrate to perform signal processing on the IC chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> Further, although a liquid crystal display is described as an example in this embodiment, the invention may obviously applied to any other active matrix type display such as an EL (electroluminescence) display or EC (electrochromic) display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be used to fabricate any liquid crystal display whether it is a transmission type or reflection type. Either of them may be freely selected by the person who carries out the invention. Thus, this invention may be applied to any active matrix type electro-optical device (semiconductor device). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> A twelfth embodiment of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> While a threshold voltage is controlled by applying an arbitrary voltage to a back gate electrode in the sixth through eleventh embodiments, a logic signal for controlling a circuit may be applied to a back gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> A thirteenth embodiment of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> While the TN mode utilizing nematic liquid crystal is used as the display mode of the semiconductor displays of the above-described embodiments, other display modes may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an active matrix liquid crystal display may be configured using thresholdless antiferroelectric liquid crystals or ferroelectric liquid crystals having a high response speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> For example, it is possible to use the liquid crystals disclosed &ldquo;Characteristics and Driving Scheme of Polymer-Stabilized Monostable FLCD Exhibiting Fast Response Time and High Contrast Ratio with Gray-Scale Capability&rdquo; by H. Furue et al., SID, 1998, &ldquo;A Full-Color Thresholdless Antiferroelectric LCD Exhibiting Wide Viewing Angle with Fast Response Time&rdquo; by T. Yoshida et al., SID DIGEST, p. 841, 1997, &ldquo;Thresholdless antiferroelectricity in liquid crystals and its application to displays&rdquo; by S. Inui et al., J. Mater. Chem. 6(4), pp. 671-673, 1996 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,594,569. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> Liquid crystal that exhibits an antiferroelectric phase in a certain temperature range is referred to as &ldquo;antiferroelectric liquid crystal&rdquo;. Mixed liquid crystals containing antiferroelectric liquid crystals include crystals referred to as &ldquo;thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals&rdquo; exhibiting electro-optical response characteristics such that the transmittance continuously changes relative to an electric field. Some of such thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals exhibit V-shaped electro-optical response characteristics, and it has been found that some of them are driven at a voltage on the order of &plusmn;2.5 V (cell thickness: about 1 to 2 &mgr;m). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> shows an example of the characteristics of the optical transmittance of thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals exhibiting V-shaped electro-optical response relative to an applied voltage. The vertical axis of the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> represents the transmittance (in an arbitrary unit), and the horizontal axis represents the applied voltage. The transmission axis of a polarizing sheet at the entrance side of an active matrix liquid crystal display is set substantially parallel with the normal direction of a smectic layer of the thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystal that substantially coincides with the rubbing direction of the active matrix liquid crystal display. The transmission axis of a polarizing sheet at the exit side is set substantially perpendicular (crossed Nicols) to the transmission axis of the polarizing sheet at the entrance side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, the use of such thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals allows driving at a low voltage and multi-tone display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> The use of such thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals driven at a low voltage in an active matrix liquid crystal display having analog drivers makes it possible to suppress the power supply voltage of an image signal sampling circuit to a value, for example, in the range from 5 to 8 V. This makes it possible to decrease the operating power supply voltage of drivers, thereby allowing reduction of power consumption of the active matrix liquid crystal display and improvement of the reliability of the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> The use of such thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals driven at a low voltage in an active matrix liquid crystal display having digital drivers also makes it possible to decrease the output voltage of the D-A conversion circuit. It is therefore possible to decrease the operating power supply voltage of the D-A conversion circuit, thereby reducing the operating power supply voltage of the drivers. This makes it possible to reduce the power consumption of the active matrix liquid crystal display and to improve the reliability of the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the use of such thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals driven at a low voltage is effective when TFTs with an LDD region (low concentration impurity region) having a relatively small width (for example, in the range from 0 to 500 nm or from 0 to 200 nm) is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> In general, thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals are subjected to significant spontaneous polarization and therefore have a high dielectric constant. Therefore, the use of thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals in an active matrix liquid crystal display requires a relatively capacitance to be retained at the pixels. It is therefore preferable to use thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals having less significant spontaneous polarization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> Since the use of such thresholdless antiferroelectric mixed liquid crystals allows driving at a low voltage, the power consumption of an active matrix liquid crystal display can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> Any liquid crystal having electro-optical characteristics as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> may be used as the display medium of an active matrix liquid crystal display according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor display according to the invention may employ any other display medium whose optical characteristics can be modulated in response to a voltage applied thereto. For example, an electroluminescence element may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> A fourteenth embodiment of the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be applied to IC techniques in general. That is, it may be applied to all semiconductor circuits presently available on the market. For example, it may be applied to microprocessors such as RISC processors and ASIC processors integrated on one chip. Alternatively, it may be applied to signal processing circuits represented by liquid crystal driver circuits (D-A converters, &ggr;-correction circuits, signal division circuits and the like) and to high frequency circuits for portable apparatuses (portable telephones, PHS, mobile computers). </paragraph>
