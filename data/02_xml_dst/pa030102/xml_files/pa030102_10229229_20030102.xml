<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to tinted contact lenses and methods of making tinted contact lenses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Tinted contact lenses are often used for cosmetic purposes to change the apparent color of the wearers irises. For example, a person with brown or blue eyes but desiring to have green eyes may wear contact lenses having a greenish pattern thereon to mask the wearer&apos;s irises with the greenish pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, tinting of contact lenses is achieved by printing a colored pattern onto a lens substrate via a pad printing process. It is to be understood that the term &ldquo;tinted&rdquo; is intended to encompass colored patterns of translucent and/or opaque pigmentations. The pad printing process employs a generally flat steel plate also known as a clich&eacute;. A pattern (or depression) is etched into the clich&eacute; by a photo-etching process. In operation, ink placed in the pattern is transferred to the lens substrate by a printing pad. To achieve a tinted lens of multiple colors, different colored inks are placed into three or fewer different patterns and serially transferred to the lens substrate by printing pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A disadvantage associated with conventional methods of tinting contact lens substrates is that such methods cannot achieve patterns of high resolution. In other words, the printed pattern on the lens substrate does not have nearly the detail of a human iris. The inability to achieve patterns of high resolution also prevents use of more than three different patterns on a lens substrate. As such, an observer viewing the wearer&apos;s eyes from five feet away or doser may determine that the wearer is wearing tinted lenses. Another disadvantage is the extensive labor needed to etch a pattern into the clich&eacute;. Typically, four to six &ldquo;man-hours&rdquo; are required to etch each pattern. Moreover, the pattern must generally be etched to precise depths so that the ink can be transferred effectively. Etching to such precise depths is often difficult. In many intricate or detailed patterns, depth variances of 3-5 microns may render the clich&eacute; useless. Another disadvantage is that the corrosive chemicals (e.g., ferric chloride and hydrochloric acid) used to etch the pattern in the clich&eacute; are hazardous both to workers and to the environment. Thus, enhanced care and cost are needed in using and disposing of the chemicals. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, a method of the present invention for making a tinted contact lens for insertion into an eye comprises providing a plate having a surface, and lasing the plate to form at least one depression in the surface of the plate. The depression is of a shape constituting an iris portion pattern. A fluent colorant is introduced into the depression. The colorant is then transferred from the depression to a lens substrate in a manner so that the colorant colors the lens substrate in a colorant pattern of substantially the same shape as the iris portion pattern of the depression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, a method of making a tinted contact lens for insertion into an eye comprises digitizing an image of a human iris into a computer. The digitized image is separated into a plurality of digitized image portions, which are used to form a plurality of depressions in a plurality of cliche portions. Each depression is of a shape constituting an iris portion pattern. Fluent colorants are introduced into the plurality of depressions. The colorants are transferred from the depressions to the lens substrate in a manner so that the colorants color the lens substrate in a plurality of colorant patterns of substantially the same shape as the iris portion patterns of the depressions. The colorant patterns combine with one another to color the lens substrate in a manner to simulate a human iris. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings and first more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> tinted contact lens of the present invention is indicated in its entirety by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The contact lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a contact lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an iris-simulating design, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, on the lens substrate. The contact lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably a conventional clear contact lens. The lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be a corrective or non-corrective lens. The iris simulating design <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is generally annular in shape and is sized to cover or enhance a wearer&apos;s iris. The iris simulating design <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be opaque to partially or completely mask the wearer&apos;s iris or may be at least somewhat translucent so that some of the wearer&apos;s iris may show through the design. It is to be understood that the term &ldquo;tinted&rdquo; is intended to encompass both iris simulating designs of translucent and/or opaque pigmentations. Preferably, the iris-simulating design <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is multi-colored and is more preferably comprised of four or more separate colors. A pad printing process is preferably used to print the iris-simulating design <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As described in greater detail below, four or more separate design portions (each preferably of a different color) are serially printed on the lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> during the printing process. The design portions (colorant patterns) combine to form the multi-colored iris-simulating pattern <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, two sub-processes are used for making the tinted contact lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The first sub-process is formation of a plurality of depressions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) in one or more printing plates (clich&eacute;s) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The second sub-process is using the clich&eacute;(s) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a pad printing process to transfer ink (or some other suitable fluent colorant) from the depressions to the lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Preferably, the ink is of a type well known in the tinted contact lens industry having binding properties enabling it to adhere to the lens substrate via a polymerization process. The ink may be opaque or translucent after being transferred to the lens substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The first sub-process is generally indicated at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the flow-chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In the first step, represented by box <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, an iris image is digitized into a computer. Digitizing the iris image may be accomplished by scanning a photograph or rendering of a human iris into the computer, or by use of a digital camera, or by using appropriate software to create an image by the computer itself. It is to be understood that the methods of digitizing an iris image mentioned herein are merely exemplary, and other methods of digitizing an iris image may be employed without departing from the scope of this invention. The digitized iris image may also comprise a hybrid image formed from different aspects of two or more iris images. The computer is preferably any commercially available computer having a suitable processor such as an Intel Pentium-3&reg; processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As represented by box <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the colors of the digitized iris image are separated into selectively distinctive layers by use of commercially available software, such as Adobe Illustrator&reg; or Adobe PhotoShop&reg;. In practice, the iris image is comprised of thousands of tiny colored regions and the colors of the regions may encompass thousands of different colors. The iris image is preferably analyzed by a designer for determining where color separations are to be made. Preferably the image is separated into four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, or more distinct color regions. Each color region is preferably mapped via a raster-based image editor, such as Adobe PhotoShop&reg;). Each color region is then converted to grayscale and then converted to a halftone pattern (box <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). Each halftone pattern is then passed through a vector-based computer drawing program, such as Adobe Illustrator&reg;. With the use of the drawing program, the halftone pattern (or digitized image portion) is adjusted and sized for export, preferably as an encapsulated postscript file, to a laser control unit of a suitable laser (indicated by box <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>). Each digitized image portion comprises the combination of all of the tiny regions of the digitized iris image assigned to one of the selected color ranges. Preferably, the laser is a yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser, such as an Electrox&reg; Scriba II, commercially available from Electrox USA, Indianapolis, Ind. The laser control unit is preferably operated with suitable software, such as that commercially available from Electrox USA. The clich&eacute; <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is then aligned with the YAG laser. Referring to box <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the laser is then operated with appropriate aperture and power settings to meet the pattern width and depth requirements suitable to form the depressions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the portions of the clich&eacute; <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. By adjusting the various power settings and/or incorporating multiple passes to the patterns, an operator is able to use the laser to vaporize finite layers of the plate conforming to the exact depression shapes desired. Preferably, the laser is operated using baselines of 2 kilohertz, aperture of 3.8 mm, yielding 5/1000 particle beam, power at 70 watts, and speed frequency of 8 hits per second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The laser forms each depression in an iris portion pattern to correspond to each digitized image portion. In other words, the digitized image portions combine to represent the digitized iris image, and the iris portion patterns of the depressions combine to represent the iris image to be printed on the contact lens substrate. As discussed above, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>show depressions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> formed in clich&eacute; portions. It is to be understood that the clich&eacute; portions may be portions of a single clich&eacute; or may be portions of multiple clich&eacute;s. In other words, the depressions may all be formed in a single clich&eacute; <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or may each be in a separate clich&eacute; without departing from the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Use of a laser to form a depression in a clich&eacute; has several advantages over forming a depression by photo etching. To begin with, a depression formed with a laser is capable of greater resolution than a depression formed with a photo etching process. In particular, the resolution capabilities with the laser process is more than 9 times greater than that of the photo etching process. The corrosive nature of the photo etching process applied at higher resolution tends to completely obscure and break down the pattern&apos;s definition. The resolution limitation of the photo etching process creates barriers to achieve resolutions requiring increased color variations for multicolored contact lenses. By using a laser process to overcome the limitations in pattern resolution, a broader range of blending colors may be employed to create a tinted contact lens that provides a more natural appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of forming a depression with a laser rather than photo etching is elimination of the need to use toxic and hazardous chemicals, such as ferric nitrate, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid. These chemicals increase chances of work related accidents or health issues. These chemicals are also hazardous to the environment and require EPA regulatory compliance for removal and disposal. Also, the unpredictability inherent in the photo etching process makes it difficult to produce depressions of desired depth. The desired depth of a typical depression used in a pad printing process to tint a contact lens is 17-25 microns. Depth variances with a photo etching process are generally &plusmn;3-5 microns. If the photo etching process does not achieve the desired depth, the pattern rendered is useless; the plate must be resurfaced and re-lapped and the complete process repeated. Conversely, if the pattern achieves too much depth (which is the tendency in the industry), the evaporation of the excess ink thinners/retardant and polymers are released into the air, thereby decreasing air quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Use of the laser process also increases the speed in which depressions may be formed in the clich&eacute;. In particular, the labor required to prepare a typical pattern in the clich&eacute; via a photo etching process is 3-6 man-hours. The labor to prepare such a pattern via the laser method of the present invention is less than one man-hour. Thus, use of the laser process results in a depression of greater resolution, reduces health risks and decreases cost of manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The second sub-process (i.e., transfer of ink from a depression in the clich&eacute; to the lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) is schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the clich&eacute; <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown having a depression <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> flooded with ink <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A doctor blade <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is swept across the clich&eacute; <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to wipe the ink <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from the clich&eacute; in a manner so that the ink is in only the depression. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a conventional pad-printing pad <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is aligned with the depression <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and pressed against the clich&eacute; <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to pick up the ink in the depression. The pad <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is then brought into registration (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) with a contact lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> held on a lens holder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and then pressed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) against the lens substrate to deposit the ink on the substrate in a pattern which constitutes a first design portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the iris simulating design (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The pad <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is then released from the lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>and the ink is allowed to dry. The first design portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> printed on the lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in this manner preferably has substantially the same shape as the pattern of the depression <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Although not shown, additional design portions are then serially printed on the lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by transferring ink from depressions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) in substantially the same manner as transferred from depression <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Preferably, different ink colors are used for each printing pattern. The design portions (colorant patterns) combine to form the multicolored iris-simulating pattern <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Although the iris-simulating pattern <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has been described as being formed by the combination of four different colorant patterns printed on the contact lens substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, it is to be understood that more or fewer colorant patterns may be combined to form an iris-simulating pattern (e.g, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, or more colorant patterns) without departing from the scope of this invention. Preferably, however, four to twelve colorant patterns are printed on the lens substrate to form the iris simulating pattern. Also preferably, each colorant pattern is a different color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects of the invention are achieved and other advantageous results attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As various changes could be made in the above constructions and methods without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </paragraph>
