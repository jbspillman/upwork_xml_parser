<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to vehicle radar systems and more particularly to a radar system to detect other vehicles and objects in close proximity to the vehicle. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As is known in the art, radar systems have been developed for various applications associated with vehicles, such as automobiles and boats. A radar system mounted on a vehicle detects the presence of objects including other vehicles in proximity to the vehicle. In an automotive application, such a radar system can be used in conjunction with the braking system to provide active collision avoidance or in conjunction with the automobile cruise control system to provide intelligent speed and traffic spacing control. In a further automotive application, the radar system provides a passive indication of obstacles to the driver on a display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A continuing safety concern in the operation of automobiles is the difficulty in seeing objects in the side blind spots of the automobile. Accidents often occur when an automobile impacts another vehicle in its blind spot when changing lanes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Rear and side view mirrors of various sizes and features are typically used in an effort to improve visualization of blind spots. For example, convex mirrors provide a larger view than flat mirrors. However, objects viewed in a convex mirror appear farther away than their actual distance from the vehicle. Also, the view through mirrors degrades during conditions of rain, snow, or darkness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There is a need for an effective way to detect obstacles in a vehicle&apos;s blind spots, and generally in close proximity to the vehicle, which is accurate and reliable during all types of environmental conditions including rain, snow, and darkness. A further characteristic of an effective detection system is a well-defined detection zone within which there is a very high probability of detection, and outside of which there is a very low probability of detection. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A method for detecting an object with a radar system includes transmitting a transmit signal, receiving a receive signal generated by at least a portion of the transmit signal impinging on the object, calculating a difference signal in response to the transmit signal and the receive signal, performing an FFT on the difference signal to provide an FFT output signal, computing a derivative of the FFT output signal, and detecting the object in response to a zero crossing of the derivative of the FFT output signal. The range to the object is determined by the frequency at which the zero crossing of the FFT output signal occurs. In one embodiment, the derivative is a second derivative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also described is a method for detecting an object with a radar system which includes generating a detection table containing a plurality of indicators, each of which is indicative of the presence or absence of an object in proximity to the radar system. Each indicator is associated with a respective radar beam and processing cycle. The method further includes combining at least two of the indicators, and providing an object detection if at least one of the combined indicators indicates the presence of the object. In the illustrated embodiment, combined indicators are associated with different radar beams and/or different processing cycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, objects in proximity to the radar system are detected with high probability, and the range to the detected objects is determined with high accuracy. By using the detection table, the method provides a reduction in the probability of a false detection. Use of the derivative of the FFT output signal, and in particular the second derivative, permits detection of certain objects which might otherwise go undetected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Radar apparatus for detecting an object includes a transmitter for generating a transmit signal, a receiver for receiving a receive signal generated by at least a portion of the transmit signal impinging the object, a differencing circuit for calculating a difference signal in response to the transmit signal and the receive signal, an FFT processor for performing an FFT on the difference signal to provide an FFT output signal, a derivative processor for computing a derivative of the FFT output signal, and a detector for detecting the object in response to a zero crossing of the derivative of the FFT output signal. The detector is further capable of determining the range to the object in response to the frequency at which the zero crossing of the derivative occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The radar apparatus includes a memory in which is stored a detection table containing a plurality of indicators, each indicative of the presence or absence of the object. A processor is provided for combining at least two of the indicators in the detection table, and providing an object detection message if at least one of the combined indicators is indicative of the presence of the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The radar apparatus, like the detection techniques, provides reliable detection of objects in proximity to the radar system with high probability, and determines the range to the object with high accuracy.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an antenna portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a microwave portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having both a transmitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a receiver <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and an electronics portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> containing a digital signal processor (DSP) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a power supply <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, control circuits <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a digital interface unit (DIU) <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a digital ramp signal generator for generating a control signal for a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), as will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> utilizes radar technology to detect one or more objects, or targets in the field of view of the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may be used in various applications. In the illustrative embodiment, the radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a module of an automotive radar system (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and, in particular, is a side object detection (SOD) module or system adapted for mounting on an automobile or other vehicle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for the purpose of detecting objects, including but not limited to other vehicles, trees, signs, pedestrians, and other objects which can be located proximate a path on which the vehicle is located. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, the radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also suitable for use in many different types of applications including but not limited to marine applications in which radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be disposed on a boat, ship or other sea vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The transmitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> operates as a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, in which the frequency of the transmitted signal linearly increases from a first predetermined frequency to a second predetermined frequency. FMCW radar has the advantages of high sensitivity, relatively low transmitter power and good range resolution. However, it will be appreciated that other types of transmitters may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Control signals are provided by the vehicle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via a control signal bus <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> processes these control signals and radar return signals received by the radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in order to detect objects within the field of view of the radar system, as will be described in conjunction with FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides to the vehicle one or more output signals characterizing an object within its field of view via an output signal bus <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. These output signals may include a target detection signal when a target exceeds the system preset thresholds. The output signals may be coupled to a control unit of the vehicle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for various uses such as blind spot and near object detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The antenna assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a receive antenna <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for receiving RF signals and a transmit antenna <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for transmitting RF signals. The radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be characterized as a bistatic radar system since it includes separate transmit and receive antennas positioned proximate one another. The antennas <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provide multiple beams at steering angles that are controlled in parallel as to point a transmit and a receive beam in the same direction. Various circuitry for selecting the angle of the respective antennas <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is suitable, including multi-position transmit and receive antenna switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an illustrative application for the radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is shown in the form of an automotive near object detection (NOD) system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The NOD system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is disposed on a vehicle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which may be provided for example, as an automotive vehicle such as car, motorcycle, or truck, or a marine vehicle such as a boat or an underwater vehicle or as an agricultural vehicle such as a harvester. In this particular embodiment, the NOD system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a forward-looking sensor (FLS) system <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, an electro optic sensor (EOS) system <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a plurality of side-looking sensor (SLS) systems <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> or equivalently side object detection (SOD) systems <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and a plurality of rear-looking sensor (RLS) systems <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In the illustrative embodiment, the radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which is shown in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a SOD system <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Each of the FLS, EOS, SLS, and RLS systems is coupled to a sensor processor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. In this particular embodiment, the sensor processor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is shown as a central processor to which each of the FLS, EOS, SLS, and RLS systems is coupled via a bus or other means. It should be appreciated that in an alternate embodiment, one or more of the FLS, EOS, SLS, and RLS systems may include its own processors, such as the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to perform the processing described below. In this case, the NOD system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> would be provided as a distributed processor system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Regardless of whether the NOD system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a single or multiple processors, the information collected by each of the sensor systems <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is shared and the processor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> (or processors in the case of a distributed system) implements a decision or rule tree. The NOD system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be used for a number of functions including but not limited to blind spot detection, lane change detection, pre-arming of vehicle air bags and to perform a lane stay function. For example, the sensor processor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the airbag system of the vehicle <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. In response to signals from one or more of the FLS, EOS, SLS, and RLS systems, the sensor processor may determine that it is appropriate to &ldquo;pre-arm&rdquo; the airbag of the vehicle. Other examples are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The EOS system <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> includes an optical or IR sensor or any other sensor which provides relatively high resolution in the azimuth plane of the sensor. The pair of RLS systems <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can utilize a triangulation scheme to detect objects in the rear portion of the vehicle. The FLS system <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,929,802 entitled Automotive Forward Looking Sensor Architecture, issued Jul. 27, 1999, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference. It should be appreciated that each of the SLS and RLS sensors may be provided having the same antenna system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Each of the sensor systems is disposed on the vehicle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> such that a plurality of coverage zones exist around the vehicle. Thus, the vehicle is enclosed in a cocoon-like web or wrap of sensor zones. With the particular configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, four coverage zones <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are used. Each of the coverage zones <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>utilizes one or more RF detection systems. The RF detection system utilizes an antenna system which provides multiple beams in each of the coverage zones <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. In this manner, the particular direction from which another object approaches the vehicle or vice-versa can be found. One particular antenna which can be used is described in U.S. patent application entitled Slot Antenna for an Array Antenna, filed on Aug. 16, 2001, and assigned application Ser. No. 09/931,633, and U.S. patent application entitled Switched Beam Antenna Architecture, filed on Aug. 16, 2001, and assigned application No. Ser. 09/932,574, each of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the SLS, RLS, and the FLS systems may be removably deployed on the vehicle. That is, in some embodiments the SLS, RLS, and FLS sensors may be disposed external to the body of the vehicle (i.e. on an exposed surface of the vehicle body), while in other systems the SLS, RLS, and FLS systems may be embedded into bumpers or other portions of vehicle (e.g. doors, panels, quarter panels, vehicle front ends, and vehicle rear ends). It is also possible to provide a system which is both mounted inside the vehicle (e.g., in the bumper or other location) and which is also removable. The system for mounting can be of a type described in U.S. patent application entitled System and Technique for Mounting a Radar System on a Vehicle, filed on Aug. 16, 2001, and assigned application No. 09/930,868, and U.S. patent application entitled Portable Object Detection System, filed on Aug. 16, 2001, and assigned application No. 09/931,276, each of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for use as a SOD system <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is shown in greater detail. In general overview of the operation of the transmitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the FMCW radar transmits a signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having a frequency which changes in a predetermined manner over time. The transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is generally provided by feeding a VCO control or ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. In response to the ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, the VCO <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> generates a chirp signal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A measure of transmit time of the RF signal can be determined by comparing the frequency of a received signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with the frequency of a sample <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the transmit signal. The range determination is thus provided by measuring the beat frequency between the frequencies of the sample <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the transmit signal and the return signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, with the beat frequency being equal to the slope of the ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> multiplied by the time delay of the return signal. The measured frequency further contains the Doppler frequency due to the relative velocity between the target and the radar system. In order to permit the two contributions to the measured frequency shift to be separated and identified, the time-varying frequency of the transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is achieved by providing a control signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to the VCO <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in the form of a linear ramp signal followed by either a CW signal or a ramp with the opposite slope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, the VCO control signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is generated with digital circuitry and techniques. In a preferred embodiment, the ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is generated by the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Use of the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and DAC <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to generate the ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is possible in the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> since, it has been determined in accordance with the present invention, that by proper selection of the detection zone characteristics including but not limited to detection zone size, shape and resolution, precise linearity of the chirp signal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is not necessary. This is a result of the correlation that exists between the nonlinearities in the transmit and receive waveforms at close ranges. With this arrangement, the frequency of the transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is accurately and easily controllable which facilitates implementation of several advantageous and further inventive features. As one example, one or more characteristics of successive ramps in the ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are randomly varied in order to reduce interference between similar, proximate radar systems, as illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 5</cross-reference>A. As another example, temperature compensation is implemented by appropriately adjusting the ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, as will be described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Yet another example is compensation for non-linearity in the VCO operation, as illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 6</cross-reference>A. Further, changes to the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which would otherwise require hardware changes or adjustments can be made easily, by simply downloading software to the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, the frequency band of operation of the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be readily varied, as may be desirable when the SOD is used in different countries with different operating frequency requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The electronics portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the power supply <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a connector <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> through which signal buses <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are coupled between the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the vehicle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The digital interface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided in the form of a controller area network (CAN) transceiver (XCVR) <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> which is coupled to the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via a CAN microcontroller <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The CAN controller <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a system clock coupled thereto to provide frequency stability. In one embodiment, the system clock is provided as a crystal controlled oscillator. An analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> receives the output of a video amplifier <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and converts the signal to digital form for coupling to the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for detection processing. In one embodiment, the A/D converter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is provided as a twelve bit A/D converter. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, however, that any A/D converter having sufficient resolution for the particular application may be used. A digital signal bus <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is coupled to antenna switch driver circuits <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> which in turn control microwave switches <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in order to provide control signals to drive the microwave switches which in turn control antenna steering. Also provided in the electronics portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a memory <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> in which software instructions, or code and data are stored. In the illustrative embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</cross-reference>, the memory is provided as a flash memory <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides the digital ramp output signals, or words to the DAC <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which converts the ramp words into respective analog signals. An analog smoothing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is coupled to the output of the DAC <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in order to smooth the stepped DAC output to provide the ramp control signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to the VCO <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a volatile memory device <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) in which is stored a look-up table containing a set of DSP output signals, or words in association with the frequency of the transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> generated by the respective DSP output signal. This data is transferred to data RAM <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> from Flash memory <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> during initial boot up of the system. This data may be corrected from time to time as a result of temperature effects as described herein. In the illustrative embodiment, the VCO <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is an SMV2488 device provided by Z Communications, Inc. of San Diego, Calif. and the VCO output signal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> has a frequency in the range of 2.31 to 2.54 GHz The SOD embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> illustrate alternative VCO arrangements for generating the transmit signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> An up-converter circuit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> up-converts the VCO output signal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to a higher frequency as is desired for transmission in the illustrative automotive NOD system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In particular, the signal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is up-converted to a frequency of between 24.01 to 24.24 GHz. The up-converter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes a 50 ohm load <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, an amplifier <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, a dielectric resonator (DR) <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and a mixer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The amplifier <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, the dielectric resonator (DR) and the transmission lines <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> form an oscillator circuit in which the DR <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> couples energy at its fundamental frequency and within its passband from transmission line <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to transmission line <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> in order to generate an oscillator signal for coupling to mixer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. In the illustrative embodiment, the oscillator signal on transmission line <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> has a nominal frequency of 21.7 GHz. The output of the mixer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is filtered by a bandpass filter <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and is amplified by an amplifier <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. A portion of the output signal from amplifier <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, is coupled via coupler <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> to provide the transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for further amplification by amplifier <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and transmission by transmitter antenna <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Another portion of the output signal from amplifier <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> corresponds to a local oscillator (LO) signal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> fed to an LO input port of a mixer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the receive signal path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The switch circuits <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are coupled to the transmit and receive antenna <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a Butler matrix. The antennas <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and switch circuits <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and Butler matrix can be of the type described in U.S. patent application entitled Switched Beam Antenna Architecture, filed on Aug. 16, 2001, and assigned application No. 09/ 932,574, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference. Suffice it here to say that the switch circuits <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and Butler matrix operate to provide the antenna having a switched antenna beam with antenna beam characteristics which enhance the ability of the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to detect targets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The received signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is processed by an RF low noise amplifier (LNA) <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a bandpass filter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and another LNA <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, as shown. The output signal of the RF amplifier <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is down-converted by a mixer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which receives a local oscillator signal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, coupled from the transmitter, as shown. Illustrative frequencies for the RF signals from the amplifier <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the local oscillator signal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are on the order of 24 GHz. Although the illustrated receiver <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a direct conversion, homodyne receiver, other receiver topologies may be used in the SOD radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A video amplifier <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> amplifies and filters the down-converted signals, which, in the illustrative embodiment have a frequency between 1 KHz and 40 KHz. The video amplifier <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may incorporate features, including temperature compensation, filtering of leakage signals, and sensitivity control based on frequency, as described in a co-pending U.S. patent application entitled &ldquo;Video Amplifier for a Radar Receiver,&rdquo; and assigned application Ser. No. 09/931,593, filed on Aug. 16, 2001, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The A/D converter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> converts the analog output of the video amplifier <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> into digital signal samples for further processing. In particular, the digital signal samples are processed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) within the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in order to determine the content of the return signal within various frequency ranges (i.e., frequency bins). The FFT outputs serve as data for the rest of the signal processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in which one or more algorithms are implemented to detect objects within the field of view, as will be described in conjunction with FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The radar system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a temperature compensation feature with which temperature induced variations in the frequency of the transmit signal are compensated by adjusting the ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> accordingly. For this purpose, the transmitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a dielectric resonator (DR) <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> coupled to a microwave signal detector <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The output of the microwave detector <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is coupled to an analog-to-digital converter which is included in the CAN controller <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) for processing by the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In operation, the DR <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> couples energy to the detector <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> only when the transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>-has a frequency within a range around the fundamental resonant frequency of the DR (i.e., within the passband of the DR). In the illustrative embodiment, the DR <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a fundamental frequency within the transmit frequency range and a passband which is relatively narrow compared with the transmit frequency range. In this illustrative embodiment the DR is provided having a passband on the order of 10 MHz centered in the middle of the band of operation of the system in order to provide sufficient frequency detection resolution as will become apparent. The detector <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> detects output power from the DR <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and provides an electrical signal indicative of a predetermined level of output power from the DR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Detection of output power from the DR <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> indicates transmission of the DR&apos;s fundamental predetermined frequency. Further, transmission of the predetermined frequency corresponds to a predetermined DSP output word which, in turn, corresponds to &ldquo;an expected&rdquo; transmission frequency as specified in the look-up table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In operation, when the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives an output signal via the CAN controller <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> from the frequency detector <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> indicating transmission of the predetermined frequency, the expected frequency associated with the DSP output is compared to the predetermined frequency by a software comparator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> within the DSP. The measured time of detection and the commanded frequency is correlated in order to make an accurate frequency measurement. Any discrepancy between the expected frequency and the measured frequency indicates that an adjustment to the DSP output is necessary. Stated differently, a difference between the two frequencies indicates that the look-up table data needs to be corrected, since the expected frequency is not being transmitted in response to the corresponding DSP output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> By way of a simple example, consider the case where the look-up table indicates that a DSP output of 11110000 corresponds to a transmit frequency of 24.20 GHz and the DR <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a fundamental frequency of 24.20 GHz. Thus, detection of output power from the DR <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> indicates that 24.20 GHz is being transmitted. However, assume further that the detection occurs when the DSP output is given by 11110001. This scenario indicates that the DSP output words need to be adjusted and, specifically, need to be shifted down by one, in order to transmit the desired, expected frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Various techniques may be used to compensate for the error between the transmitted frequency and the expected frequency. As one example, an offset equal to the amount of the error (i.e., the difference between the transmitted frequency and the DSP output word that is stored in the look-up table in association with the DRO&apos;s fundamental frequency) may be added or subtracted, depending on the direction of the offset, each time a new DSP output word is provided and until a new error is detected. Stated differently, each subsequent DSP output is simply shifted by the amount of the detected error. Since temperature generally does not change quickly, this error detection and correction may be performed relatively infrequently, such as once every 50 ms or 100 ms. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that other structures and techniques may be used for detecting the frequency of the transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to feedback to the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for the purpose of adjusting the DSP output words in order to thereby adjust the frequency of the transmit signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> single cycle of an illustrative ramp signal <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> as provided at the output of the DAC <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is shown. In operation according to the above-described temperature compensation feature, detection of an error between the predetermined transmit signal frequency (i.e., the DRO fundamental frequency) and the expected transmit frequency associated with the DSP output word generating the predetermined frequency results in modification of the DSP output words as described above. The effect of shifting the DSP output words up or down is a shift of the ramp signal up or down, accordingly. For example, following correction of the DSP output, the nominal ramp signal <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is shifted down in voltage to provide temperature compensated ramp signal <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> An interference reduction feature of the SOD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to a further aspect of the invention is implemented with a random, or pseudo-random number generator <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), as may be provided by software within the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The random number generator <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is used to randomly vary at least one aspect, and parameter of the ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Examples of such parameters are the offset interval of each chirp cycle as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and the voltage (and thus frequency) range generated in each chirp cycle as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> plurality of cycles of an illustrative ramp signal <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, corresponding to ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), for coupling to the VCO <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are shown. Each ramp cycle starts at a time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . and has a ramp portion R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> . . . commencing at an offset time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . following the respective cycle start time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , as shown. According to the invention, the duration of the offset interval of each cycle (i.e., intervals t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . ) is randomly selected by the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This is achieved by introducing a random delay corresponding to the offset interval into a recursive process by which the ramp signal is generated. In the illustrative embodiment, each ramp cycle is on the order of 1.1 msec and the offset interval of each cycle is randomly selected from one of sixteen possible intervals between 0 and 0.1 msec. As a result, at any given time, the frequency of the resulting transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will be different than the frequency of transmit signals from like radar systems, although the transmission frequency range of the radars will be the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> With this arrangement, two identical SOD radar systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operating proximate to each other over the same frequency range will not interfere with one another since, at any given time, the frequency of the transmit signals provided by the systems will vary randomly with respect to each other. This feature advantageously permits two or more identical SODs to be used on a vehicle, as is desirable to reduce the parts count of the NOD system and simplify replacement of one or more modules within the NOD system. A less desirable approach to reduce interference between proximate SODs would be to manually manipulate or program each SOD to ensure different transmit signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> An alternative technique for reducing interference illustrated by the ramp signal <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> entails randomly varying the frequency range of the transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> during each ramp cycle while still staying within the specified frequency range for the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This is achieved by introducing a random offset voltage to the ramp signal during each cycle while keeping the peak-to-peak ramp signal voltage constant (i.e., moving the ramp up or down while keeping peak-to-peak ramp voltage constant). For example, during the cycle commencing at time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the ramp R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> increases from 1 volt to 2.5 volts, thus corresponding to a first frequency range. During the next cycle, the ramp R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> increases from 1.25 volts to 2.75 volts, corresponding to a second different frequency range. In the illustrative embodiment, the frequency range of the transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is randomly selected from twenty-four different frequency ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Various techniques in either the analog or digital portions of the circuitry, are possible for introducing an offset voltage to the ramp signal in order to randomly vary the voltage range. As one example, the offset voltage is introduced by the smoothing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that although the ramps R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . of the ramp signal <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> have random offset intervals (i.e., offset intervals computed as t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . ) as described above in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the transmit frequency range can be randomly varied without also varying the offset interval. Stated differently, the technique of randomly varying the offset interval of each ramp cycle and randomly varying the frequency range of each ramp cycle can be implemented separately or in combination. It will also be appreciated that although the offset interval of each ramp cycle is randomly varied in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 5</cross-reference>A and the voltage range is randomly varied in each ramp cycle in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, the selected parameter(s) may be randomly varied in one or more of the ramp cycles and need not be randomly varied in every ramp cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is compensation for non-linear operation of the VCO <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a curve <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> representing the relationship between the frequency of the VCO output signal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) versus the VCO control signal voltage <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The illustrative curve <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> has a typical frequency range on the order of 180 MHz and a typical voltage range on the order of 1.25 volts. Although in an ideal VCO the relationship is linear as illustrated by curve <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, typically there is some non-linearity, as shown in the curve <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. This non-linearity is compensated, or nulled by adjusting the DSP output words accordingly. More particularly, the DSP output words are adjusted in order to provide ramp voltage (i.e., DAC output voltage) that is substantially complementary with respect to the actual curve <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. Such a complementary curve <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The operation of VCO <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is characterized (i.e., a curve like <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is generated) by feeding a sequence of DSP output words to the DAC <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and measuring the transmit frequency with a test receiver (not shown). Such VCO characterization can be done at manufacture or prior to or after insertion of the VCO in the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or prior to or after placing a SOD system on a vehicle. Having characterized the VCO, the complementary curve of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> is simply determined by taking the complement of the curve with respect to the ideal characteristic (labeled <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). A sequence of DSP output words necessary to generate the VCO control signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> can then be determined. By way of a simple example, where prior to characterization of the VCO, a DSP output sequence of 00000000, 00000001, 00000010, 00000011, . . . might be used to generate a linear ramp, in order to compensate for the VCO non-linearity, the sequence might be adjusted to 00000000, 00000000, 00000001, 00000010, . . . . The process of determining the necessary sequence of DSP output words to generate the control signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can be performed manually or can be automated and preferably is repeatable from system to system. Typically, the correction to the DSP output words is made in software and stored in memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> With knowledge of the way in which VCO output frequency varies with input voltage, the VCO control voltage <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can be adjusted in order to force the output frequency of the VCO to be swept in a desired manner. Although the relationship between VCO output and VCO input is non-linear, the relationship between VCO output and DSP output is substantially linear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Also, it will be appreciated that, given knowledge of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> characteristic curve <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> of the VCO <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, the system may be optimized to operate over a particular input voltage range to the VCO. Specifically, the most linear region of operation of the VCO (as labeled <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) can be selected as the DAC output voltage range simply by selecting a range of DSP output words necessary to generate the desired DAC output voltage range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an alternate SOD system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> differs from the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in the VCO portion of the transmitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which processes the ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to generate the transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Portions of the SOD system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> which are identical to the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> have like reference numbers. Like the VCO <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the VCO <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is responsive to the ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and provides an output signal to a bandpass filter <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which, in turn, provides an output signal having the desired transmit frequency in the range of 24.01 to 24.24 GHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The SOD system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> includes a VCO <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> in the form of a voltage controlled DRO <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. The VCO <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> further includes a 50 ohm load <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> coupled to an amplifier <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> which, in turn, is coupled to a diode phase shifter <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. The phase shifter <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, signal coupling paths <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, amplifier <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and dielectric resonator <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, form an oscillation loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In operation, the DR <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> transfers signals within its passband from transmission line <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> to transmission line <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. The signal is amplified by amplifier <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> until the amplifier saturates. The passband of the DR <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is selected to cover the desired frequency range of transmission which, in the illustrative embodiment is a range of 24.01-24.24 GHz. The final frequency of the signal on transmission line <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> is controlled by adjusting the phase shift introduced by the phase shifter <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. In this way, the diode phase shifter <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> provides phase reinforcement on the oscillation loop so that the oscillation loop seeks out the frequency determined by the feedback loop which includes the phase shifter and the DR. In general, a feedback loop will oscillate at a frequency whereby a feedback signal, for example a signal on signal path <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, achieves zero degrees phase (or any multiple of three hundred sixty degree phase) as it travels around the loop back to its starting point, with a loop gain, or gain around the loop, greater than one. Thus, by altering phase shifter <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, the frequency at which the feedback signal will achieve zero degrees will be similarly altered, and, so long as the loop gain remains greater than one, the loop will oscillate at the altered frequency. With the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, up converting of the signal provided by the VCO <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is not necessary since the VCO operates within the desired transmit frequency range to generate the transmit signal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, another alternate SOD system <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> differs from the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in the VCO portion of the transmitter and the antenna arrangement. Portions of the SOD system <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> which are identical to the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> have like reference numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The SOD <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> includes a VCO <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> receiving ramp signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> from the analog smoothing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The VCO <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> operates in the transmit frequency range of between 24.01 to 24.24 GHz and provides an output signal to bandpass filter <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, as shown. Since the VCO <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> operates in the transmit frequency range, the need for up-converting of the VCO output signal (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that features, components, elements and other portions of the SOD system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the SOD system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and the SOD system <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> may be mixed and matched. As one example, it will be appreciated that the antenna arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> may be used with the VCO <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> or the VCO <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> block diagram of the SOD electronics <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) is shown in greater detail to include the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the CAN microprocessor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the CAN transceiver <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, power supply <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the memory <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. The memory <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> provides non-volatile storage of data and program information. Also shown is the video amplifier <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> providing an output signal to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which is coupled to port <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> of the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the memory <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is provided as a 128 k&times;8 flash memory and the port <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is provided as a serial port of the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The D/A converter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> receives the digitized ramp signal in the form of a sequence of digital words from the DSP through the port <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, as shown, and is further coupled to the smoothing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes RAM <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> in which data is stored, such as the look-up table of VCO control signal voltage <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> versus transmit frequency, and a program RAM <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> in which process instructions are stored, such as software code used to implement the detection algorithm described below. Program and data information stored in memory <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are transferred to program RAM <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and data RAM <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, respectively, upon application of power. The illustrative DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is an ADSP2186M microprocessor manufactured by Analog Devices, Inc. and includes an oscillator <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> operating at 33 MHz which is doubled internally to 66 MHz which is the clock rate of the DSP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> further includes digital input/output (I/O) port <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> at which the antenna control signals are provided on bus <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>.

The serial EEPROM <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is used to hold data such as calibration constants and diagnostic test results and trouble codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative embodiment, the random number generator <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) used to implement temperature compensation and the comparator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) used to compensate for non-linear VCO operation are implemented by the DSP as a series of software instructions stored in the program RAM <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and executed by the microprocessor. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art however that these functional blocks as well as others may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software or a combination of hardware, firmware or software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The illustrative CAN microprocessor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is a TMS470R1F316, a member of the TMS470 family from Texas Instruments and includes RAM <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, flash memory <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, an A/D converter <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, serial ports <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, digital I/O ports <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, a CAN interface <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, and an oscillator <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, here operating at 4.915 MHz.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The CAN A/D converter <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> has a plurality of multiplexed inputs adapted for receiving various monitoring signals. As examples, the output of frequency detector <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is coupled to the CAN A/D converter <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. Another optional input to the CAN A/D converter <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> is provided by a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The temperature sensor provides an output signal indicative of the temperature of the receiver <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and may be used separately or in conjunction with features of the oscillator <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to compensate for temperature induced frequency variations in the RF VCO <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Optional detectors for detecting power supply faults may also be coupled to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. The CAN A/D converter <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> converts the received signals to digital form for further processing, generally by the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, an exemplary detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, shown in top view, is an azmuthal region in which a SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> (also referred to as a SOD sensor <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>) which may be of the type described above in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is specified to detect objects. Only objects within a specific detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in proximity to an automobile <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> on which the SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is mounted are included in a detection, and objects outside of the detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> are excluded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The detection zone shape, of which the indicated zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is only one example, depends upon the application in which the radar system is used. For example, an automobile SOD system is designed to detect objects in the adjacent lane of traffic including objects within the blind spot of the vehicle. Detection of objects in lanes of traffic beyond the adjacent traffic lane and outside of the blind would be undesirable. As another example, an automobile FLS system <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) used for purposes including but not limited to collision avoidance is designed to detect objects generally in front of the vehicle. Thus, each application requires a different shape of detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The sideward detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes a maximum detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, a minimum detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and a nominal detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> between the maximum and minimum detection zone boundaries. In a preferred embodiment, the SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> does not detect objects outside of the maximum detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and always detects objects within the minimum detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. A probability region <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> exists between the maximum detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and the minimum detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. The SOD system may or may not detect an object in the region <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. Probability region <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> exists due to imperfections and tolerances of practical circuit components which make up the SOD system <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. Ideally, the region <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> would have a width of 0 meters. Thus, the probability of detection in the probability zone is between zero and one hundred percent. An exemplary probability region <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> has a maximum width of 0.6 meters. The detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> further includes a minimum range <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> which is the distance from the SOD system to the closest object that will be detected. In the illustrative SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the nominal detection zone boundary has an average width on the order of ten meters and an average length on the order of four meters. The minimum range <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> is on the order of 0.25 meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The size and shape specifications of the detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and probability region <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> dictate many design parameters associated with the SOD system architecture. For example, in order to provide a SOD system performance that can transition from no detections to certain detections within a given probability region <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, the SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> can determine the range to an object with a measurement accuracy which is relatively high compared with the width of the probability region <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. For example, in the case where the probability region has a width of 0.6 meters, the measurement accuracy of the SOD system should be on the order of 0.06 meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As another example of a system parameter determined by the detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, the specification of a wide detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> in azimuth relative to the SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, requires a wide radar coverage in azimuth. Furthermore, a detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> with a complex contour requires that multiple beams be used in the detection algorithm, each with a different detection range. The beams related to the detection zone will be shown in greater detail in association with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> For another example, the specified minimum range <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> of the detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, can preferably be achieved with a system architecture that uses a chirp signal, like the FMCW chirp signal described above in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In particular, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has specified that low power radar, at power of six decibels (6 dB) effective isotropic radiated power (6 dB<highlight><subscript>eirp</subscript></highlight>) such as that used by the SOD systems discussed above, can have a frequency bandwidth no greater than 200 MHz. As will become apparent from the following description, the short range requirement <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> and the FCC bandwidth requirement together preclude the use of conventional pulsed radar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The FCC 200 MHz bandwidth requirement is met by the SOD system being an FMCW system since a slowly varying FMCW signal can be generated with a narrow bandwidth of 200 MHz. For example, the SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> generates a transmit signal having a frequency which increases from approximately 24.000 GHz to 24.200 GHz in approximately 1 ms and has a bandwidth of 200 MHz. In contrast, conventional pulsed radar in a short range application cannot meet the 200 MHz FCC bandwidth requirement. A pulsed radar is also limited in its ability to detect objects at short ranges. This is because, in order to operate at the short ranges required of the SOD system, a pulsed radar system would require a very short radar pulse. Not only is such a short pulse technically difficult to achieve, but also, as the pulse width becomes narrower, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal becomes wider. A pulsed radar with pulse widths sufficiently short to enable operation at a minimum range <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> on the order of 0.25 meters fundamentally requires a frequency bandwidth in excess of 200 MHz. Thus, the characteristics of the detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> impact the system design in many ways. The detection algorithm processing that operates upon the received echoes, or signals, is also selected to operate with detection zones having particular characteristics. The detection algorithm is described below in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> While a detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to the side of the automobile is indicated, it should be recognized that other detection zones of specified sizes and shapes can be equivalently specified around the automobile <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, such as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. For example, frontal zones and rearward zones can be specified without departing from this invention. Typically, an automobile manufacturer specifies one or more detection zones, including zone size, shape and position relative to the automobile. The SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> can be configured so as to provide the appropriate side detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> regardless of where it is mounted on the side of the automobile. Other probability zones <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> and other minimum detection ranges <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> are also possible with this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Also, while the SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is shown at a position to the rear of the outside rear view mirror <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>, the detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the resulting SLS sensor <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> location can be located anywhere along the perimeter of the automobile <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>, two different examples of side detection zones <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> are shown. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, the maximum detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> is provided having a trapezoidal shape. An exemplary SOD system provides eight azimuthal beams <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>each with a different maximum detection range, as indicated in shading, and as determined by the detection algorithm that operates upon the beam echoes. The algorithmic control of the maximum detection range of each of the eight beams defines the shape of an actual maximum detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> versus the specified maximum detection zone boundary <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The exemplary SOD system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A, 11B</cross-reference> has eight beams, each with a beam width of approximately fifteen degrees and with a total azimuth scan of in excess of one hundred fifty degrees. It will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that other numbers of beams (e.g. fewer than eight or more than eight) and scan angles are possible without departing from the present invention. The particular number of antenna beams to use in a particular application is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including but not limited to the desired detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the width of the probability region <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> shows a detection zone <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> having a substantially rectangular shape of the maximum boundary. Again, an exemplary system provides eight azimuthal beams <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>each with a different maximum detection range as indicated in shading, the ranges <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>being different from beams <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>so as to form a different actual maximum detection zone <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, indicated again by shading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> flow diagram illustrates a process <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> performed by the SOD processor, such as DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The process contains major cycles and minor cycles. A minor cycle includes all detection operations that are performed utilizing a particular beam of the SOD antenna system. A major cycles includes operations that are performed utilizing the full group of beams provided by the SOD antenna system. In step <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> a major cycle is initiated and in step <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> a minor cycle is initiated. Initiating the major cycle <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> involves resetting the beam to the first beam. Initiating the minor cycle <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> involves resetting the beam to the next adjacent beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A chirp signal is initiated in step <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>. During a chirp, a number n of digital samples of the received signal are processed by the A/D converter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), previously described, at a rate of f<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>KHz, in a time period t. In the illustrative embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, n&equals;256, f<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>&equals;256 KHz, and t&equals;1 msec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> While it will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that other numbers of samples at other rates are possible with this invention, selection of n and f<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>determine the eventual frequency and range resolution and thus must be selected to meet all system detection requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>574</bold></highlight>, range thresholds are established at each beam pointing angle in order to define the detection zone. Thus, at a given beam pointing angle, range detections that are either too far or too near to the SOD system to fall within the detection zone are excluded by way of pre-established range thresholds. Echo magnitude window thresholds are also established in step <highlight><bold>574</bold></highlight>. Only object detections that produce echoes above a lower threshold and below an upper threshold, i.e. within the magnitude window, are considered valid. An echo that is below the lower threshold could be caused by system noise rather than an object or target. An echo that is above the upper threshold could be caused by an interfering radar source, such as a radar transmission from another vehicle. Thus, both range and amplitude thresholds are established at step <highlight><bold>574</bold></highlight>. It should be recognized that by altering the range thresholds, other specified detection zone shapes and sizes can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>578</bold></highlight>, the data samples are truncated, whereby a small number of samples at the beginning of the data set and at the end of the data set are removed. The removed samples may contain unwanted artifacts due to hardware limitations such as amplifier setting which can occur after switching from one antenna beam to another, etc. In the illustrative embodiment, approximately two hundred fifty six data samples remain after truncation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Also in step <highlight><bold>578</bold></highlight>, the remaining input samples are amplitude weighted, or windowed. Recall from the discussion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> that the data samples output of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are. processed by an FFT within the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Amplitude weighting of the data samples that are input to an FFT can provide beneficial effects with regard to the minimum width of a spectral peak in the resulting frequency domain, and the sidelobe magnitude associated with each FFT frequency bin. Essentially, with a spectrally pure frequency input to an FFT, input weighting can make the resulting FFT output appear in a smaller number of frequency bins than would occur with no input weighting. Since the frequency difference between the received echo and the transmitted signal relates directly to range, then the accuracy with which the received echo frequency is detected relates directly to range accuracy. Resolving a frequency to a single FFT bin or better is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary SOD system a Chebyshev weighting function is applied to the input samples. This weighting function provides a good compromise between spreading of a narrowband signal into multiple FFT bins and a good sidelobe suppression. It will also be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that various amplitude weighting functions could be applied to the input data samples, and that the weighting may be applied with a variety of techniques including both hardware and software multiplication&apos;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> It will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that an FFT output is a frequency domain spectral representation of digital input samples to the FFT, where the digital input samples are samples of a time domain analog signal. It will also be recognized that the parameters, including number of samples, n, and sample rate, f<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>, determine the frequency resolution, or bin width, f<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight>, of the FFT output by the relation f<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight>&equals;f<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>/n. Since the range of a target is associated with the frequency of the received signal, the frequency resolution correlates to a range resolution. As has been described above, a range resolution better than 0.6 meters is required in order to achieve the specified detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The exemplary SOD system provides two hundred fifty six data samples, n, taken at a 256 KHz sample rate, f<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>. Thus, the resulting FFT frequency resolution, f<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>, is 1 KHz. The corresponding range resolution can be derived as follows. As mentioned earlier, in the illustrative SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), the frequency chirp is swept in frequency through 200 MHz in approximately 1 msec. One KHz thus represents a time period of approximately 5 nsec. In 5 nsec, radar energy can propagate a distance of approximately 1.5 meters. Since the energy propagates both to the target and back, the range to the target represented by a 1 KHz signal from the A/D converter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is approximately 0.75 meters. A 2 KHz signal represents a target at 1.5 meters, etc. Thus, an FFT bin width of 1 KHz corresponds to a target range resolution of 0.75 meters. This measurement accuracy does not meet the desired range resolution of less that 0.6 meters. Additional processing is thus necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment at step <highlight><bold>578</bold></highlight>, an zero padding technique, recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, is applied to the input samples to the FFT in order to reduce the resulting FFT bin width. It will also be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that other techniques may be used to reduce the FFT bin width. For example, various interpolation techniques can be applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The windowed and zero padded input samples are operated on with an FFT operation in step <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight>. Time domain data samples are collected from a chirp echo and a complex FFT is performed on the data samples. Subsequent processing can improve the measurement accuracy still further as described starting at process step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>586</bold></highlight>, a magnitude calculation is performed on the complex FFT data, whereby the FFT real and imaginary parts of the complex FFT data are used to calculate an FFT magnitude, hereafter called FFT output data, or an FFT output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As the data samples associated with a particular beam steering angle in azimuth can vary from one such data set to another, averaging of either time domain data samples or FFT output data associated with a particular beam steer angle can reduce the rate of false detections, or improve the false alarm rate. For example, where system noise or other artifacts cause variation in the detected frequency and amplitude, averaging can reduce the impact of such artifacts and thus improve system performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether four chirps have been processed, to be used in the aforementioned averaging. If four chirps have not been processed, then processing returns to step <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> where another chirp is initiated. If four chirps have been processed, then processing proceeds to step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> in which the FFT output data from the four chirps are averaged. Whereas the exemplary SOD system uses four averaged chirps for each beam within the minor cycle timing, it will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that other numbers of chirps can also be averaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, the resulting FFT output data is also range normalized. Whereas a radar return echo signal generally loses amplitude proportional to range, and whereas increasing FFT bins are proportional to increasing range, the FFT output data without range normalization would indicate an amplitude reduction across the FFT bins. Range normalization is provided to adjust the FFT bin amplitudes by scale factors to minimize the amplitude range dependency of the FFT output data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, the minimum and maximum range thresholds, frequencies R<highlight><subscript>min </subscript></highlight>and T<highlight><subscript>BeamRange </subscript></highlight>respectively, and minimum magnitude threshold, T<highlight><subscript>object</subscript></highlight>, are applied to the averaged FFT output data. The thresholds will be described more fully in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A</cross-reference>. and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B. Let it suffice to say here that the range thresholds limit detections to those objects that are not too close and not too far from the SOD system, specific to the particular beam pointing angle, so as to detect objects as required within a specified detection zone, for example detection zone <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Additional processing is required in order to achieve range accuracy much better than the 0.6 meters as required by the exemplary detection region <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. To this end, in step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, first and second derivatives of the FFT output data are computed by the DSP, as discussed further in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference>. As will be explained below, range accuracy is significantly improved by use of the first and second derivatives of the FFT output data. In step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, the negative going zero crossing of the first derivative and second derivative are computed as will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The first and second derivatives of the FFT output data provide an indication of whether a detection has or has not occurred. In the case where a detection has occurred, the first and second derivatives also provide a range to the detected object. Only those objects with a range within the range thresholds, and with sufficient magnitude are considered as valid targets by the SOD system in step <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, thereby setting a minor cycle detection flag. Step <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> concludes a minor cycle of processing in which detections associated with a single beam steering angle are made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, the minor cycle detection flag is stored in a detection table, or target detection report matrix. The table is shown in block <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> and includes columns corresponding to antenna beams and rows corresponding to major cycles. Each entry in the table is a minor cycle detection flag. A &ldquo;T&rdquo; (true) indicates a minor cycle detection in the associated beam detected during the minor cycle and F (false) indicates no minor cycle detection. Thus, the entry labeled <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, indicates detection in the first radar beam during a minor cycle. A complete row is obtained during each major cycle and each column of the detection table <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> comprises successive minor cycle detection flags for a given beam steering angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> After a minor cycle detection flag is stored in the table, it is determined in step <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> whether a major cycle has ended, i.e., whether a minor cycle detection flag has been provided for the last beam. If the major cycle has not ended, then processing returns to step <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> on the next beam and steps <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> are repeated for that beam. Alternatively, if the major cycle has ended, thus completing a row of the detection table, then the table is analyzed in step <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>, minor cycle detection flags stored in the detection table are logically combined to provide an alert condition message with a reduced false alarm rate. An alert condition message <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight> indicates either the presence or absence of a target within the detection zone. For example, groups of four minor cycle detection flags such as those groups labeled <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> in the table may be logically combined to reduce the false alarm rate. The logically combined groups <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> can span both minor and major cycles, i.e. can span more than one column or more than one row. In the illustrative embodiment, each group (e.g. group <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight>) is a 2&times;2 matrix of detection flags. It will be recognized that group <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> is analyzed only at the completion of the major cycle represented by the third row of the detection table, whereas group <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> is analyzed at the completion of the major cycle represented by the second row of the table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Each combined group <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> is processed to determine if at least two detection flags within the group are true. In particular, two or more true minor cycle detection flags in a 2&times;2 group of minor cycle detection flags yields an alert condition message that indicates a target detection. Thus, processing of group <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> yields an alert condition message resulting from consecutive detections in beam <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during consecutive minor cycles. Processing of group <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> likewise yields an alert condition message caused by detections in beams four and five during one major cycle. Although a particular logical combination of minor cycle detection flags has been described, it will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that other logical combinations of minor cycle detection flags from one or multiple beams and from one or more major cycles are possible with this invention. Upon completion of major cycle processing in step <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>, a new major cycle is initiated in step <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> An alert condition message that indicates the presence of a target in the detection zone can cause a system action appropriate for the application. For example, a visual indication or audible alarm may be provided to alert the driver that an object is within the detection zone of a SOD system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows minor cycle timing in relation to the chirp signal and processing steps. A minor cycle <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight> is completed on each beam steering angle in a predetermined period of time (e.g. 5.5 ms). Within that time period, four radar chirps <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are transmitted, the chirp echo returns are differenced from the transmission and the difference is sampled during intervals <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the differences are FFT analyzed during intervals <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the FFT magnitudes are calculated during intervals <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and the four FFT output data are averaged at interval <highlight><bold>668</bold></highlight>. First and second derivatives are computed and analyzed during interval <highlight><bold>672</bold></highlight>, and a minor cycle detection flag is generated at interval <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight>. The minor cycle <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight> is then repeated for the next beam. Note that the processing associated with intervals <highlight><bold>668</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>672</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>676</bold></highlight> is performed coincidentally with sampling of the first chirp <highlight><bold>680</bold></highlight> in the next minor cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Randomly variable chirp offset intervals <highlight><bold>680</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>680</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>as described above in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 5</cross-reference>A provide a reduction in false detections caused by receptions from other radars including other SOD systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The overall minor and major cycle timing is selected in order to detect objects within a specified time period so that system actions can be taken in an appropriate amount of time. For the illustrative SOD system <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), an alert condition message is generated at the completion of each major cycle, i.e. at the completion of seven minor cycles. Thus, an alert condition message is generated in approximately once every 50 msec. The CAN microprocessor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) has an asynchronous update rate for the overall vehicle of approximately 300 msec. Thus, several major cycles and associated alert condition messages are generated during each CAN cycle. While specific timing selections have been described for the illustrative embodiment, it should be recognized that other timing selections are possible. For example, averaging of other than four FFTs, and use of other than seven beams are possible. One of ordinary skill in the art, after reading this description would clearly understand how to implement any necessary modification to the timing structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference> an illustrative FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> as may be generated in step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> contains a magnitude detection peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight> at a detection frequency <highlight><bold>690</bold></highlight> that corresponds to a particular detection range and one or more FFT bins. It should be recognized that the detection peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight> from a single target may be broader than a single FFT bin. As mentioned above, the broadening of the detected echo in the frequency domain is related to aspects of the particular FFT, in particular the weighting function that may be applied the input data samples to the FFT. Broadening can also be related to physical aspects of the echoing target, such as the dimension of the target along the axis of the particular radar beam. An extended target has an extended range and thus may appear as a broadened frequency corresponding to the range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In general, the peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight> of the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> for a single target is a frequency <highlight><bold>690</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the range to the target. However, in association with FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, it will be seen that the peak can give a false impression of the range to the target in some cases. For now, let us assume that the peak of the FFT output data curve indicates the range to the target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As has been discussed in association with the detection algorithm <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the FFT frequency bins may not be sufficiently narrow to provide the required accuracy required for a particular detection zone. Where the detected signal from a single target is spread between several FFT bins, additional processing must be done on the FFT output data in order to provide sufficient range resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Consideration of the first derivative <highlight><bold>694</bold></highlight> of the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> reveals that the peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight> of the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> is coincident with the negative going zero crossing <highlight><bold>698</bold></highlight>. Thus, the negative going zero crossing <highlight><bold>698</bold></highlight> of the first derivative <highlight><bold>694</bold></highlight>, provides the frequency <highlight><bold>690</bold></highlight> of the FFT peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight>, and thus, the corresponding range to the target. Range detection in this manner provides greater accuracy than simply determining the range by determining the fractional frequency bin of the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> in which the peak occurs since the peak may occur in multiple FFT bins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> It should be recognized that although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference> show the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> and FFT first derivative <highlight><bold>694</bold></highlight> as smooth continuous waveforms, the FFT output data, represented by FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight>, and first derivative <highlight><bold>694</bold></highlight> are comprised of discontinuous digital samples. As a result, finding the zero crossing of the first derivative <highlight><bold>694</bold></highlight> requires additional processing. If the spacing of the points of the first derivative <highlight><bold>694</bold></highlight> are sufficiently close, then adjacent first derivative data points lie approximately on a straight line. With this approximation, the zero crossing <highlight><bold>698</bold></highlight> can be found by a conventional similar triangles technique. In the illustrative embodiment, spacing between data points on the order of 500 Hz has been found to be sufficient. However, it will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that other data point frequency spacings can be used with this invention. It should be noted that the zero crossing <highlight><bold>698</bold></highlight> of the first derivative so determined can be at any frequency and need not be at the center of an FFT bin, thus the resolution in frequency and associated range resolution is greatly improved as compared to the conventional technique of determining the frequency bin in which the FFT peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight> occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> For complex echo returns, for example from multiple targets or from a target that is extended along the beam axis, the negative going zero crossing <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> of the second derivative <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> is determined and provides greater range discrimination that the use of the first derivative in the above manner. The negative zero crossing <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> of the second derivative <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> of the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> corresponds to a negative inflection point <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> of the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight>. A negative inflection point <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, is a point where the slope of the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> changes from curving upward to curving downward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> It will be recognized that the rising portion of an FFT output data feature, for example <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, has a discrete negative inflection point <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, whereas the peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight> of the feature can be extended along the frequency axis. Although the broadening of an FFT output data feature is related to both to mathematical characteristics of the FFT, such as the input sample weighting, and to dimensional characteristics of the target, the shape of the rising portion of the FFT output data feature <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> is, to a first order, related only to the FFT mathematical characteristics. The negative inflection point <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> on the rising portion of the FFT output data feature <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> can be used to predict the frequency of the FFT peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight> as may be desirable where the peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight> is not otherwise distinct. In essence, for a relatively broad range of target dimensional characteristics, the distance <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> between the negative inflection point <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and the FFT peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight>, is known and constant, determined only by the mathematics of the FFT. Thus, by finding the first negative inflection point <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> of the rising portion of an FFT output data feature <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, and by using the negative inflection point <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to predict the position of the peak <highlight><bold>686</bold></highlight>, the range to the target can be found even for more complex FFT output data curve spectral shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> As noted in conjunction with step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, thresholds R<highlight><subscript>min </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>717</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><subscript>BeamRange </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>, specific to the particular beam pointing angle, are applied to the calculated frequency of an object range as calculated by either first derivative or second derivative test. In particular, those peaks within the thresholds will be considered valid. Similarly, only those peaks that are above a magnitude threshold T<highlight><subscript>object </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> are considered valid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> an example curve <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight> corresponding to FFT output data as may be caused by a target that is extended along the beam axis so as to result in a nearly flat top FFT output data curve for which a peak would be indeterminate or result in multiple peak detections <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight> is shown. Also shown is curve <highlight><bold>736</bold></highlight> which corresponds to FFT output data resulting from a non-extended target. Comparison of the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight> with the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>736</bold></highlight> reveals coincident negative inflection points <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. Thus, computation of the second derivative of the FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight> and use of the resulting negative zero crossing to determine peak <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> by adding the known distance, i.e. frequency, between negative inflection point <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> and peak <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> as described above, results in an accurate range determination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, another curve <highlight><bold>744</bold></highlight> corresponding to an example of FFT output data as may be caused by simultaneous receipt of echoes from two targets, of which one is weaker than the other is shown. Note that a strong echo can cause the curve portion <highlight><bold>748</bold></highlight> of the composite FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>744</bold></highlight> associated with the weaker echo to have no peak at all, while the curve portion <highlight><bold>752</bold></highlight> from the stronger target has a distinct peak <highlight><bold>756</bold></highlight>. Still, the negative inflection points <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight> found by computing the second derivative of the composite FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>744</bold></highlight> can be used to predict the range of both targets. Detection of the two negative zero crossings of the second derivative of FFT output data curve <highlight><bold>744</bold></highlight> and use of the known distance, like distance <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, results in detection of peak frequency points <highlight><bold>768</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>756</bold></highlight>. A first negative inflection point <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> is used to find the peak <highlight><bold>768</bold></highlight> corresponding to the first target range, though a peak <highlight><bold>768</bold></highlight> does not in fact exist. A second negative inflection point <highlight><bold>764</bold></highlight> is used to similarly find the peak <highlight><bold>756</bold></highlight> corresponding to the second target range. Since the frequency peaks correspond to target range, the range to both the strong and weak target can be discriminated. Thus, use of the second derivative of the FFT output data provides range discrimination for targets represented by more complex FFT output data curves. </paragraph>
