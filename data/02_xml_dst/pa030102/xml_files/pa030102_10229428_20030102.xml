<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system for granting access to agents at a communication center in response to requests for connection from network-level entities starts a fairness timer having a fairness time period when a first request is received for and agent, monitors any other requests for the same agent during the fairness time, and executes an algorithm at the end of the fairness time to select the network-level entity to which the request should be granted. In a preferred embodiment the fairness time is set to be equal to or greater than twice the difference between network round-trip latency for the longest latency and shortest latency routers requesting service from the communication center. In some embodiments an agent reservation timer is set at the same point as the fairness timer to prevent calls to the same agent, and has a period longer than the fairness timer by a time sufficient for a connection to be made to the agent station once access is granted, and for notification of the connection to be made to network-level entities. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is in the field of telephony communication and has particular application to methods including software for routing incoming telephony calls from multiple service control points to agent-level in a communication center wherein equal access is afforded to callers from separate routing systems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Telephone call processing and switching systems are, at the time of the present patent application, relatively sophisticated, computerized systems, and development and introduction of new systems continues. Much information on the nature of such hardware and software is available in a number of publications accessible to the present inventors and to those with skill in the art in general. For this reason, much minute detail of known systems is not reproduced here, as to do so may obscure the facts of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> At the time of filing the present patent application there continues to be remarkable growth in telephone-based information systems. Recently emerging examples are telemarketing operations and technical support operations, among many others, which have grown apace with development and marketing of, for example, sophisticated computer equipment. More traditional are systems for serving customers of large insurance companies and the like. In some cases organizations develop and maintain their own telephony operations with purchased or leased equipment, and in many other cases, companies are outsourcing such operations to firms that specialize in such services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A large technical support operation serves as a good example in this specification of the kind of applications of telephone equipment and functions to which the present invention pertains and applies, and a technical support organization will be used from time to time in the current specification for example purposes. Such a technical support system, as well as other such systems, typically has a country wide or even a world wide matrix of call centers for serving customer&apos;s needs. Such call center operations are more and more a common practice to provide redundancy and decentralization. However, the components of the present specification can apply to a single call center as well, and t home agent systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a call center, a relatively large number of agents handle telephone communication with callers. Each agent is typically assigned to a telephone connected to a central switch, which is in turn connected to a public-switched telephone network (PSTN), well-known in the art. The central switch may be one of several types, such as Automatic Call Distributor (ACD), or a Private Branch Exchange (PBX). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An organization having one or more call centers for serving customers typically provides one or more telephone numbers to the public or to their customer base, or both, that may be used to reach the service. The number or numbers may be published on product packaging, in advertisements, in user manuals, in computerized help files, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There are basically two scenarios. If the organization providing the service has a single call center, the number will be to the call center, and all further routing to an agent will be at the call center. If there are several call centers, the organization may provide several numbers, one for each call center, and the customer may be expected to use the number for the closest center, or for the center advertised to provide specifically the service he or she might need. In some cases the number provided will connect the caller with a first Service Control Point (SCP) which is adapted to pre-process incoming calls and forward the calls to other call centers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Routing of calls, then, may be on several levels. Pre-routing may be done at SCPs and further routing may be accomplished at individual call centers. As described above, a call center typically involves a central switch, which may be, for example, an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD), or a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) or other equivalent (IP is switch less per se). The central switch is connected to the PSTN network, well known in the art. Agents, who are trained to handle customer service, use telephones connected to the central switch. This arrangement is known in the art as Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> If the call center consists of just a central switch and connected telephone stations, the routing that can be done is very limited. Switches, although increasingly computerized, are limited in the range of computer processes that may be performed. For this reason additional computer capability in the art has been added for such central switches by connecting computer servers adapted to run control routines and to access databases. The processes of incorporating computer enhancement to telephone switches is known in the art as Computer Telephony Integration (CTI), and the hardware used is referred to as CTI equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a CTI system telephone stations connected to the central switch may be equipped also with computer terminals, so agents manning such stations may have access to stored data as well as being linked to incoming callers by a telephone connection. Such stations may be interconnected in a network by any one of several known network protocols, with one or more servers also connected to the network one or more of which may also be connected to a processor providing CTI enhancement, also connected to the central switch of the call center. It is this processor that provides the CTI enhancement for the call center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When a call arrives at a call center, whether or not the call has been pre-processed at a SCP, typically at least the telephone number of the calling line is made available to the receiving switch at the call center by a telephone carrier. This service is available by most PSTNs as caller-ID information in one of several formats. If the call center is computer-enhanced (CTI) the phone number of the calling party may be used to access additional information from a database at a server on the network that connects the agent workstations. In this manner information pertinent to a call may be provided to an agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is known to the inventors that more recently Data Network Telephony (DNT) communication has been integrated into the call center environment. Internet Protocol Network Telephony (IPNT), which is a subset of DNT, is most often used in today&apos;s DNT-capable call centers. Computer simulated telephony is now being practiced in many CTI call centers. In many cases, equipment is altered or modified to handle both Connection-Oriented-Switched-Telephony (COST) and DNT telephony simultaneously and in a seamless fashion. Because of added communication capabilities existing in today&apos;s call centers, a more appropriate term of communication center will hereinafter be used in this specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a very large communication center, it is desired that all incoming calls whether from a COST network or from an IPNT network be handled efficiently by available agents. In some cases calls are routed from network level to a call center, and then further routed to agents at the communication center. Calls are typically distributed to such agents based on availability of the agent, and in this system availability of agents is tracked at the call center level. In other systems, employing what the inventors term agent-level routing, Service Control Points (SCPs) in the network route calls to agent level at call centers. In this arrangement agent availability is typically tracked at the network level, and updated from the call-center level. In either system If a first agent is unavailable, a caller must wait for the agent to become available, or be transferred to another available agent. When incoming calls to a communication center are from different routing systems in a telephony network it becomes difficult to insure equal and fair access to agents for all of the callers. This is due to various states of latency that exist in separate routing systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Latency factors such as equipment speed and line speed can vary greatly over large geographical regions within a service network such as a public network. This is due to partly to the fact that older equipment is upgraded to new equipment on a gradual basis. The same is true with network lines and connections. Because of this inconsistency over large portions of a telephony network, some callers or groups of callers to a communication center may inadvertently get much better service because of the fact that they are being routed over faster lines with better equipment. In considering DNT networks, similar latency conditions exist that may cause some callers or groups of callers to receive poor service compared to those routed in over superior connections with superior equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> What is clearly needed is a method and apparatus that eliminates inadvertent unequal access associated with regional groups of callers that may exist because of unequal latency factors in their portion of a network. A system such as this would insure that all callers receive comparable service from a communication center regardless of the latency factors. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in a communication center, a method for ensuring fairness in response to electronic requests from network-level entities to connect to an agent station at the communication center is provided, comprising steps of (a) receiving a first request from a first network-level entity for connection to the agent at the communication center; (b) starting a fairness timer for a timed period; (c) receiving, during the period of the fairness timer, a second request for the connection to the same agent station from a second network-level entity; and (d) determining to grant, through execution of a fairness algorithm at expiration of the period of the fairness timer, one of the first and second requests from the network level entities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments latency times for network level entities requesting connection at the communication center are known, and in step (b) the period of the fairness timer is set to be equal to or greater than twice the difference between network round-trip latency for the longest latency and shortest latency routers requesting service from the communication center. Also in preferred embodiments the requests may be for telephony connections, either connection-oriented switched telephony (COST) or Internet Protocol Network Telephony (IPNT) calls, including any type of multimedia calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments the method includes a further step for starting an agent reservation timer at the same time as starting the fairness timer, the agent reservation timer having a period longer than that of the fairness timer. The time of the reservation timer in one embodiment is longer than that of the fairness timer by a time sufficient for a connection to be made to the agent station once access is granted, and for notification of the connection to be made to network-level entities. The fairness algorithm may operate on one or both of load and agent availability data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention a communication center is provided, comprising a communication switching device connected to agent stations for switching communications to individual ones of the agent stations; a computer-telephony integration (CTI) processor coupled to the communication switching device; and a digital link between the CTI processor and network-level routing entities for receiving requests from network-level entities for connection to agent stations. In this communication center the CTI processor, on receiving a first request for connection to an agent station, starts a fairness timer having a time-out period, and in the event of receiving a second or more requests for connection to the same agent station during the fairness time period, executes a fairness algorithm at the end of the time-out period to determine which request to grant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the communication latency times for network-level entities requesting connection at the communication center are known, and the period of the fairness timer is set to be equal to or greater than twice the difference between network round-trip latency for the longest latency and shortest latency routers requesting service from the communication center. The connection requests may be for telephony connections, either connection-oriented switched telephony (COST) or Internet Protocol Network Telephony (IPNT) calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the communication center the CTI processor starts an agent reservation timer at the same time as starting the fairness timer, and the agent reservation timer having a period longer than that of the fairness timer. A suggested value for the reservation timer is longer than that of the fairness timer by a time sufficient for a connection to be made to the agent station once access is granted, and for notification of the connection to be made to network-level entities. In preferred embodiments the fairness algorithm operates on one or both of load and agent availability data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention an agent-reservation fairness software for operation in a communication center and dealing with requests by network-level routers for connection to agents at the communication center is provided, comprising a monitor for monitoring incoming requests for connection to agents; an initiator for starting a fairness timer having a fairness time-out period; and a fairness algorithm for determining which of multiple requests for connection to a same agent to grant. The monitor, on receiving a first request for connection to an agent causes the initiator to start the fairness timer, and at expiration of the fairness time-out period, in the event of further requests for connection to the same agent, the fairness algorithm executes and determines which request for the same agent to grant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the software the period of the fairness timer is set to be equal to or greater than twice the difference between network round-trip latency for the longest latency and shortest latency routers requesting service from the communication center. The requests may be for telephony connections, either connection-oriented switched telephony (COST) or Internet Protocol Network Telephony (IPNT) calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the software there is a second initiator for starting an agent reservation timer at the same time as starting the fairness timer, the agent reservation timer having a period longer than that of the fairness timer. The period of the agent reservation timer is longer than that of the fairness timer by a time sufficient for a connection to be made to the agent station once access is granted, and for notification of the connection to be made to network-level entities, and the fairness algorithm may operate on one or both of load and agent availability data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the invention described below in enabling detail, for the first time a system is provided for call centers wherein fair access can be provided to requests for service from multiple and disparate sources having different latency characteristics, such that a request from a network entity having a long latency will receive equal chance of reserving and connecting to an agent as a network entity having a short latency.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As described in the background section, latency variations inherent in different routing systems can cause inadvertent priority states to exist for callers and groups of callers attempting to secure available agents in a communication center. The inventor provides a CTI system that eliminates or at least significantly reduces undesired priority states that may exist due to such latency differences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an overview of a network communication system <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> enhanced with the software and according to an embodiment of the present invention. Communication system <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> comprises a telephony network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a connected communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be a PSTN network, an IPNT network, or a combination of the two. In this example, network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a PSTN network and will serve to describe examples of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be a large CTI service center, or any other type of CTI-enhanced communication center. Center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may also be capable of IPNT communication in combination with COST communication. In this example, communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is a CTI-enhanced telephony center and will serve to enable explanation of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is known that there are many separate routing systems that may exist within a PSTN network such as network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Two such systems illustrated herein are system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Systems <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are separate from each other in that they use separate equipment and connection lines as well as separate router intelligence to route telephony traffic. Systems <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> represent any two routing systems in network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that are not local to each other in a geographic sense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Routing system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a local telephony switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> adapted to receive calls from individuals operating in that locale. Switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be an ACD or PBX type switch, or any other type of telephony switch that may be known in the art. An incoming call represented by a vector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is illustrated as arriving at switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In this example, switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is connected by a telephony data line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to an SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> provides routing decisions to switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for calls <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. For example, calls from individuals using a 1-900 number, a 1-800 number, or the like for contacting communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are routed by SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is enhanced by a CTI processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> enhances functionality of SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by virtue of software provided by the host of communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Such software enables communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to control routing of calls within network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to enterprise rules. For example, an instance of a CTI application known as T-Server (known to the inventor) is provided and executable on processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. T-Server software provides a wide variety of intelligent routing routines that may be executed to determine how SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will route calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Routing system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has an equipment and connection scheme that, for the purpose of this invention, mirrors the components and elements in system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. For example, a CTI switch <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is provided and adapted to receive calls <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from individuals in that locale. Switch <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is connected to an SCP <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by a data connection <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A connected CTI processor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> running an instance of T-server software enhances SCP <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that the equipment and exact connection schemes may vary from one routing system to another within network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. However, the inventor illustrates identical schemes in each illustrated routing system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for the purpose of simplifying explanation of the present invention. Moreover, in a network such as PSTN <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, there may be many more separate routing systems than are illustrated here. However, the inventor deems that the illustration of two such systems in this example is sufficient to explain the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Both routing systems <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are used to route incoming calls to communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. To this end, communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is appropriately equipped to receive calls routed thereto by system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. For example, communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a CTI telephony switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> that is adapted to receive calls from network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be an ACD, PBX, or any other type of telephony switching system that is known in the art. Switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is CTI-enhanced by virtue of a connected CTI processor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> running an instance of T-server software. Switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> acts as a central switch for communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. That is, all calls arriving from network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are received at switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and distributed to individual agent stations <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is connected, by virtue of internal telephony wiring <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, to a plurality of agent-manned telephones <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Telephones <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are implemented one each at separate agent workstations <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> respectively. Stations <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are equipped with agent-operated personal computer/video display units (PC/VDU&apos;s) that are connected to each other, and to a customer information server (CIS) <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by a local area network (LAN) <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> CTI processors <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> (center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>), <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (routing system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (routing system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) communicate by virtue of a digital networks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>separate from telephony trunk lines <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> over which voice calls are routed. Networks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are adapted to enable data communication between such connected CTI processors. Communicated data may include such as command and control data, call information data, and the like. In this way, information about a call may arrive at communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> ahead of an actual routed call. This allows agents operating at workstations such as stations <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> access to pre-event information and better prepares them to handle incoming calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In an enhanced telephony communication system such as system <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> described above, incoming calls <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are routed from respective switches <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> over telephony infrastructure represented herein by trunk <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which represents varied and alternative routing paths through network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that, in actual practice, routing systems <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as well as network paths through infrastructure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will, in many cases, exhibit different latency characteristics. For example, routing system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may have older and slower equipment and slower network connections than routing system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. If so, then routing system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> will exhibit a higher latency for transactions with center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> than will routing system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This latency difference can cause groups of callers from system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to enjoy, without design, better access to available agents in communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. This is at least partly due to the requisite nature of telephony routing protocol. A network router must request a routing event, receive information regarding routing options, and only then can the router route the call from the local switch to a communication center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A request for a routing event by a network router in embodiments of the present invention is made over the same network data links (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) that are used for parallel data transfer, as described above. The request can be a negotiation between processors separate from the transfer of data from a network routing system (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>), or it may be combined with the data transfer. Similarly, in some embodiments of the invention the identity of the network router needs be known, and this piece of information may also be combined in the parallel data transfer for a pending call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to the skilled artisan as well that the examples of the invention described with reference to two network routing systems (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) are not limiting. Call requests may be negotiated in a call center with network routers as shown and described, but also between a call canter and other entities. Requests for routing may come from overflow at another call center, or in a load-balancing arrangement with several other centers, for example. The practice of the invention applies to all architectures wherein cal reservation requests may come to one center from another source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> To alleviate the problem of inadvertent preference or priority as stated above, the inventor provides herein a software routine termed a &ldquo;fair access&rdquo; (FA) routine. The FA routine executes on CTI processor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and may be integrated with T-server software. The inventor illustrates the FA routine separately from T-server software simply to show separate function. The FA software provides a fairness timer function each time an agent is reserved, and denies access to that agent to any incoming request route until the time period has expired. When the fairness time expires, than access is awarded to a call based on an algorithm that awards access based on a round robin system or a performance history of each routing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In actual practice, the FA routine is integrated with other CTI applications and routines that may be in place at communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and in network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by virtue of T-server software. By using the FA routine, communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can provide more equal and fair agent access to separate routing systems such as systems <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, regardless of their latency characteristics. A detailed description of a T-server routine enhanced with the FA routine of the present invention is provided below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a process flow chart illustrating steps for reserving and connecting to an agent using a single router according to an embodiment of the present invention. The exemplary process represented herein illustrates a T-server routine integrated with a FA routine being executed for one call request made by one routing system such as system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This example may be used in conjunction with elements described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to gain an understanding of the unique FA software. Therefore, many references will be made to elements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> throughout following example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, a request to route arrives at an SCP such as SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (router) from a local network switch such as switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The request is initiated by call <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which is waiting to be connected to an agent at center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> invokes a routing strategy based on information from or about caller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and T-server software running on CTI processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The strategy invoked in step <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> includes the selection of a destination number (DN <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) for an agent at communication center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, a busy treatment timer (BTT), or T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is started at SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The BTT (T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) determines how long a call must be held at a routing point before parking it in queue. Ideally, the BTT time period should be less than the maximum required response time (RRT) minus network roundtrip latency (SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to CTI processor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) minus T-server and router processing latencies. For example, if RRT equals 500 ms and round-trip delay (RTD) equals 60 ms, and T-server/Router latency is 210 ms, then the BTT for call <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> should be set for 230 ms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> requests an agent from T-server software running on CTI processor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Such an agent may be one operating at workstation <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> taking calls at telephone <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which may be, in this example, the number for telephone <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. At steps <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> T-server software running on processor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> marks the agent at workstation <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> unavailable and starts an FA timer (T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and an agent reservation timer (T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The FA timer sets a period of time during which other routing systems may request access to a same agent, before one router will be granted access to the agent. In this example, however, there are no competing requests. No access is granted to any requesting router until T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> expires in step <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When FA timer T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> expires in step <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, T-server software running on processor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> returns access confirmation for DN <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> notifies switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to route call <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> call <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> arrives at switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Having successfully acquired access to the agent at workstation <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, call <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is internally routed in step <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> to telephone <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> over wiring <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (agent reservation timer) expires but the current agent status reported to network routers such as SCP <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is that the agent is busy with call <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, all network routers are updated of DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> status, which is busy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> FA timer (T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is necessary to provide fair distribution of available agents between all separate routing systems competing for connection. Without T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the routing systems with the shortest latency periods would acquire preferential access to all agents, as they became available. If all routing systems have the same delay factor (highly unlikely), then the T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> timer may be set to zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is found through empirical method that the value of T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> should be about two times the difference in latency between the most geographically distant, and the closest network routers which are configured in the loop. The latency factors for each network router should be measured at approximately 95% delivery-probability time. This will insure that 95% of all calls will be processed according to a fair distribution algorithm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that the example presented above involves only one network router requesting an agent. Therefore, a fairness algorithm was not invoked in this example. If another router had requested an agent during time period T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, then a fairness algorithm would be called once T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> had expired. An example of more than one router competing for an agent is provided below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The agent reservation time T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is the time that agents are marked as unavailable when they are reserved for a call. This time period is long enough for a reserving voice call to be routed through network <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, arrive at switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, be presented to the agent, and notification of agent status to be sent to all other network routers. If this time period is set too short, then there is a chance that one agent will receive two calls. If T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is set for too long a period, the agent may be idle well after he has terminated the last event. A suggested time limit is approximately 10 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If agents in a communication center such as center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are routinely handling very short calls of only a few seconds or so, T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be canceled and an event-release detection (ERD) routine (known to the inventor) may be incorporated in T-server software running on CTI processor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). An ERD routine detects released events for each agent at each DN and sends notification to all network routers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that the process steps above may vary somewhat according to enterprise rules without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, there may well be additional steps as well as sub-routines involved in actual practice. The inventor intends that the process steps illustrated herein only to be one example of a basic routine using only one router. A more complex interaction is provided below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a process flow chart illustrating steps for determining which of two routing systems will be granted access to an agent according to an embodiment of the present invention. As with the example above referencing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and elements contained therein will be referenced throughout this example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, a route request arrives at SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from local switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on behalf of call <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> invokes a routing strategy and selects DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, a busy treatment timer T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is started. At step <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> requests an agent on DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, T-server marks the agent as unavailable. In step <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, T-server starts T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (fairness timer) and T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (reservation timer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Note that the above-described process steps are the same as steps <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, however, before T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> expires, a second routing system comes into play. Following the broken direction line from step <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>, at step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a route request arrives at SCP <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of routing system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The request arrives from local switch <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> on behalf of call <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. SCP <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (competing router) repeats steps <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> for a request of DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, T-server (processor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> at center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) queues the request for DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by SCP <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. It is noted here that the agent at DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has already been reserved by SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, therefore, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have already been started (step <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>). If additional routing systems (none shown) make requests for DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> during the time period of T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the requests will also be queued by T-server software running on processor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Following the broken direction line from step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, in step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> expires. Step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> triggers step <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> as indicated by the solid direction line. In step <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, T-server software, by virtue of an FA routine employs an algorithm to determine which requesting routing system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) will be granted access to DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The fairness algorithm may, in one embodiment, be based on an arbitrary rotation scheme between network routers such as SCP&apos;s <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, statistical analysis may be used to keep individual percentages of granted requests to each routing system fairly even. This method would also take into account total requests from each routing system so as not to penalize one system for lack of requests. The fairness algorithm may be any one of many possible schemes. Employing the fairness timer (T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) insures that unintentional preferences or priorities are cancelled out for all routing systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, T-server employing the FA routine returns access for DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to router <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (SCP <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) even though router <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) was first to reserve an agent at DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, illustrated below step <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, T-server issues a failure notification regarding DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Steps <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> occur simultaneously and are indicated by broken direction lines emanating from step <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Steps <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> represent the routing of call <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from switch <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and further internal routing to an agent at DN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in this case one picking up telephone <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> at workstation <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Moving to step <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, another route request from local switch <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (router <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) arrives. Following the broken direction line from step <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, the process repeats steps <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, however in this case SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> selects DN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the routing strategy (<highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>). When T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> expires for DN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>), T-server returns access for DN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In this case no competing router made a request for DN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> time, therefore access was granted to SCP <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, another route request arrives at SCP <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> from local switch <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. SCP <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> invokes a routing strategy in step <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and selects DN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, the T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> timer (agent unavailable) invoked in step <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> for the agent at DN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is still running. Therefore, T-server issues an immediate failure notification to SCP <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. It will be noted here that while T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> timers are both running, competing requests for a same agent are queued as in step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. At the end of T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> time, the fairness algorithm determines which router will get access. After T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, but during T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the agent will be unavailable to all routers until T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> expires, unless an ERD routine is in place as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that the process steps described above may vary according to communication center capability and enterprise rules without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. There may be added routines, and sub routines included and integrated with the various routing strategies of a communication center such as center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> It should also be apparent that there may be many routing systems of varying latency rates connected to one or a number of communication centers practicing the present invention. In this case there may be premise to premise routing. Such cases are handled in the same fashion as network to premise cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be practiced in a communication center that is enhanced for IP telephony as well as COST telephony, and may be modified to work with alternate forms of media such as voice mail and the like. Therefore, the method and apparatus of the present invention should be afforded the broadest scope. The spirit and scope of the present invention is limited only by the claims that follow. </paragraph>
