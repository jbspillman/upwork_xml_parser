<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> In new building construction, the plumbers prefer not to put the finished closure valves in the bottom of tubs, or the finished decorative plate over the overflow outlet at the end of the tub until the project is finished because these elements will be often damaged as the construction project is brought to a close. Further, the piping for both of the outlets needs to be checked for leaks before the inspection process is completed. The test involves running water down the vent for the drain until it reaches a level above the tub and the tester then determines whether any of the piping leaks. Thus, when the testing operation arrives, a plug is put in the bottom drain of the tub and some sort of seal plate is placed at the end of the tub on the overflow outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Existing overflow plates have a center opening therein. There are either two or four small screw holes in the plate adjacent the center opening wherein two of the holes are used to hold the plate to the plumbing fixture. In some cases there is a fitting so that the screw hole is located directly in the middle of the access hole. In that case, that hole is in the way when the testing procedure is implemented. In any event, the testing procedure usually involves stuffing a balloon through the large center opening into the pipe in the wall and the pipe is sealed when the balloon is inflated. Further, existing seal plates normally have to be removed when the decorative plate is put on. Two screws which use the screw openings of the plate typically hold the decorative plate in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A more recent version is shown in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,890,241 in which an overflow system for a bathtub has an overflow port and has a drain pipe in connection with the overflow port. A flexible diaphragm is imposed over overflow drain pipe secured to and engages the inner face of the sleeve. Screws extend through the plate which has a center opening. A screw extends through the plate to hold the cap in place. The cap has a conventional side rim extending around the plate and diaphragm. A cut-out portion of the cap provides for water flow. The diaphragm seals the overflow pipe when the system is being tested for leaks with pressurized fluid. Following the tests, when the fluid is removed, the diaphragm is cut or slashed to open the overflow port to provide fluid flow. While this device serves the intended function, it is expensive to make and more cumbersome to assemble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, a principal object of the invention to provide a method and a means for an overflow assembly for bathtubs and the like which will safeguard the overflow system during construction; prepare the system for testing; and facilitate the final installation of the bathtub hardware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to facilitate the testing procedure of the overflow system before the final installation has taken place, and to permit the assembly of parts without the use of screws, screw holes, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> These and other objects will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An overflow system in the bathtub has an overflow port and has a drain pipe in connection with the overflow port. A threaded flange has a stub shoulder on one end which is forced-fitted into a circular sleeve on the overflow port. The threaded flange has exterior threads on its outer surface and a thin diaphragm secured to the end thereof opposite to the stub shoulder. A large sealing washer embraces the outside of the circular flange on the overflow port and extends partially over the threads of the threaded flange. A large internally threaded nut is threadably mounted on the outer end of the threaded flange and compresses the sealing washer against a vertical flange on the port to seal the connection between the threaded flange and the port. A decorative cap is frictionally snapped into engagement with protrusions on the outer surface of the nut. The cap can be removed if needed to permit the plumber to gain access to the diaphragm to cut it open for fluid flow after they system has been tested for leaks, or put in place after the cut takes place.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With reference of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a conventional bathroom structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a floor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a hollow wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a wall opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> therein. A conventional bathtub (&ldquo;tub&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which rests upon floor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Sidewalls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extend upwardly from base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as does an end wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A bottom <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> dwells in spaced relation to the floor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A conventional drain port <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is located in bottom <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A conventional overflow port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is located in the end wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). A vertical drain pipe <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends downwardly from drain port <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and overflow drain pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extends downwardly from overflow port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A horizontal pipe <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connects pipes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A drain pipe <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extends downwardly from the junction between pipes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A conventional vertical vent pipe <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is located within the hollow wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Pipe <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> interconnects vent pipe <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the upper end of overflow drain pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Conventional water pipes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> extend through hollow wall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and are connected to valve <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is interconnected to conventional control member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and faucet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a radial flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> formed on the upper end of pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and has a center opening or port <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Water can flow through center opening <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> into drain pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Sleeve <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extends longitudinally outwardly from the perimeter of opening <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A hollow cylindrical fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has a hollow cylindrical shoulder <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on its inner end, a threaded outer surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and a thin plastic diaphragm <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> sealed across its outer end. The shoulder <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has an outer diameter that can be manually frictionally inserted with the inner diameter of flange <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A pliable sealing ring or washer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has a center bore <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> which can frictionally receive the exterior surface of fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to engage the radial flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of port <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to seal the connection between sleeve <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and shoulder <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The longitudinal thickness of washer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is less than the longitudinal thickness of fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> so that some of the threaded surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> adjacent the diaphragm <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is exposed when the washer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is mounted on fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the position described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A nut element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has a threaded center bore <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which is compatible with the threaded outer surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. When nut element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is tightened on threaded portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the washer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is in tight engagement with flange <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of port <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The outer periphery <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of nut element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has a series of radially extending lugs <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which frictionally detachably engage the inner surface of flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of cap <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Nut element can be tightened on washer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> either as positioned within cap <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, or before cap <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the nut element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are engaged. A notch <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is located in flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and is adapted to receive overflow water from tub <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> when required to do so. Notch <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is normally in a 6 o&apos;clock position on flange <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is important to note that diaphragm <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is of plastic material, as is fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and is preferably integrally formed with fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> wherein diaphragm <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are one unitary component. Diaphragm <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is a thin circular plate disk that is joined to fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by its outer peripheral edge engaging the outer peripheral edge of the fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. If the two components are not molded as one unitary structure, the diaphragm <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> could be connected by fusing, hermetically sealed, or by otherwise rigidly attached by its outer peripheral edge to the rearward outer peripheral edges of the fitting by a suitable adhesive. No screws or the like are either required or desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In operation, the drainage system comprising the ports <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and pipes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are installed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Vent pipe <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and connecting pipe <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are also installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the conventional testing procedure, the port <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is plugged in any convenient manner. The fitting <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with diaphragm <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is installed into drain pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as described above so there is no fluid access to the upper end of pipe <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> either inwardly or outwardly through overflow port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The vent pipe is charged with water at some elevation above pipe <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so that the building inspectors can check to see if there are any leaks in the system. Having determined that there are no leaks, the water is purged from the system. The plumber can then approach overflow port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, (since cap <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is not yet installed) and by using knife <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> or the like, cuts can be made in diaphragm <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> leaving a cutout portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is therefore seen that diaphragm <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> eliminates any need to install or remove any screws or the like for sealing overflow port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> before or after the testing procedure has taken place. This invention facilitates the testing procedure and reduces the time needed to seal the overflow port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and then to open the diaphragm <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for possible fluid flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is therefore seen this invention will achieve at least all of its stated objectives. </paragraph>
