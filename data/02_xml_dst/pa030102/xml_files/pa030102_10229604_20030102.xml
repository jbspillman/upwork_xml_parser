<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, there is shown generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a machine for making plastic bags having opposed closable openings of the type as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 9</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or variations thereof. Referring to the plastic bag <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it is comprised of a front panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a rear panel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, fused together along side seams <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. The rear panel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extends beyond the mouth opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to define a flap <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is herein provided with wicket holes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to hold the bag in an automatic filling machine, not shown. The other end of the bag is provided with a zipper closure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> spaced inwardly from an outer folded edge portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the bag. A perforated tear line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends through the panels and provides for this outer edge portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to be torn off whereby to separate the panels at the end section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to cause the zipper closure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to unlock, as is well known in the art. An important feature of the plastic bag <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is that a gusset end wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed adjacent the zipper closure, whereby to cause the bag to expand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, whereby to accommodate two products <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime; in the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, one product, namely <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, is disposed against the gusset end wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and is accessible by opening the zipper closure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The other product <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime; is accessible through the gathered open end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by removing the closure tag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In this particular illustration, the products <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime; are bread loaves with one being a white bread and the other being a brown bread. Of course, other different products may be provided in such bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With reference now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, there will be described a manner in which the gusset end wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed. The simplified illustration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> constitutes the rear end section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the machine and as hereinshown, there is provided a mandrel <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on which a film supply roll <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) is secured. The film sheet <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is folded about guide rolls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and drawn over a sheet folder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as is well known in the art, whereby to form a J-folded sheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> wherein the flap <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed. The film is drawn in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&prime; by drive rolls <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and located at the front end of the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In order to form the gusset end wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, there is provided a gusset former assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which folds the folded edge <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the J-folded sheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and which assembly is more clearly illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>,.As hereinshown, the gusset former assembly is constituted by a lower and an upper film positioning plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and each provided with guide edge <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively. An intermediate film guide wheel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is disposed between the space parallel positioner plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The disposition of the stationary plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the guide wheel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is illustrated more clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and as hereinshown these plates are disposed parallel to one another. Of course, these plates are also adjustable to provide for gussets of varying sizes as is dictated by the bag design. As hereinshown the guide edges <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>&prime; are offset from one another whereby to form a bag with a double offset folded closed edge defining an outer film folded edge <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and an inwardly spaced folded edge <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> interconnected together through an intermediate inwardly spaced folded film section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. After the bag is thus folded it is drawn through a zipper application station <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, of a type well known in the art, and as illustrated more clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and whereat the folded film sheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is continuously drawn in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The zipper applicating station is hereinshown as comprising a plastic zipper applicator <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which is displaceable on a guide rod <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> whereby to position the zipper closure female section or part <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and male part <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>&prime; against the rear panel <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and front panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and fuse them thereon by the heating bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> provided in the zipper applicator <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. This zipper applicator is well known in the art. An additional zipper applicator <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime; may be provided on the other side of the folded film sheet when it is necessary to affix opposed zipper locks on the folded film sheet as will be described later when describing the construction of a double compartment bag with opposed closable openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates the position of the female and male zipper closures <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on the back and front panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as well as the gussetted folded end wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As hereinshown there is also formed the perforated tear line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through both the front and rear panels. These panels are hereinshown separated but in fact they are juxtaposed and heat fused along their opposed side edges to form the side seams <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a modified gussetted end of the bag where the side seam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is angulated at <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; whereby to form a gusset end wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&Prime;, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is substantially square. This angulated seam would be formed in the square bottom sealer section <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the J-folded sheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> exits the zipper applicator it is then drawn through a dancer roll assembly <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> at the front end of the square bottom sealer section <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the machine, as schematically illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. A serrating cutting wheel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is pressed against the outer edge portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the folded film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to form the perforated tear line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in opposed film sheets. The folded film sheet then goes through a plurality of stationary rolls <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, then dancer rolls <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> whereby to impart a substantially constant drive to the folded film sheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the rear end section of the machine prior to the folded film sheet reaching the sealing section where the folded film sheet is intermittently driven to permit slitting and sealing operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Because the zipper is a fairly thick plastic part, as compared to the film sheet, it is desirable to compress the outer edges <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; of the zipper as clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> whereby to form a thin plastic section in areas where the side seam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is to be formed. This is done by squeezing the end section <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the zipper, or another section depending on the shape of the gusset end wall to be formed, between a forming head <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and an anvil <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> when the film is stopped with the zipper aligned with the forming head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The folded film sheet is then drawn, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, wherein the folded film sheet is drawn through a hole punch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which punches the wicket holes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the flap <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It is pointed out that the forming head <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the hole punch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the sealing and cutting bar <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> assembly including a hot knife <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>&prime; and sealing roll <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>&Prime; are all synchronized together and with the drive rolls <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. As hereinshown, the folded film sheet is then fed through a sealing and slitting bar to form the side seals <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and to slit the folded sheet into bags along cut line <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The then-formed plastic bags <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are then discharged by the drive rolls <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> onto a transporting turret <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> wherein the bags are discharged into a stack <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> or a container or conveyed to another station for processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Summarizing the method of forming the bag as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it consists essentially of drawing a prefolded film sheet through a gusset former to form an offset gusset end wall, then a serrated tear line is formed adjacent an outer folded edge of the folded film sheet, and the folded edge is drawn through a zipper applicator station where a zipper section is fused on the opposed panels of the folded sheet. The prefolded film sheet with the offset gusset and the zipper and tear line is then fed through a bag former where the bags are transversely slit and edge sealed. To effect the edge sealing and transverse cutting it is desirable to compress a region of the plastic zipper, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, whereby to reduce the thickness of the zipper to facilitate slitting and sealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, there is shown the construction of a plastic film bag <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is formed with the machine as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> but modified slightly whereby the plastic film bag <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is formed with two inner compartments <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which are separated by a transverse seal line <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The entire bag is formed from a single film sheet which is not cut into panels. This seal line <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may be formed by positioning a sealer unit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> centrally of the film folded panels and it is preferable when forming such bag <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to use a U-fold film sheet <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As hereinshown, the U-fold sheet has a opposed panels <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>&prime; which are of substantially equal width. The gusset former assembly <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is not utilized in this process but it is necessary to draw the U-folded film sheet through the serrating wheel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> whereby to form the perforated tear line <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> adjacent the folded edge <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the U-folded film sheet. Also, two zipper applicators <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime; are utilized to affix two zippers <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>&prime; adjacent opposed ends of the prefolded sheet. The opposed end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the sheet is an open end and accordingly, it is not necessary to perforate the film sheets at that end to tear off the folded end portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The plastic film bag <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provides for two separate compartments being accessible to a respective closable open end. Such film bags find many uses such as for packing lunch bags where a sandwich <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> can be packaged in one of the compartments herein compartment <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the other compartment provided with condiments <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> such as tomatoes, pickles, chocolate bars, etc., which are different type condiments which should not be contact with bread but wherein both can remain fresh and isolated from one another. Such bag also provides for quick and easy packing as it is not necessary to provide separate type packaging for the foodstuff or the provision of plastic containers which are usually never the proper size and take unnecessary space when packaged. Such double compartment plastic bag also provides visual access to its different type contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>show a bag similar to that as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>but one that is formed with a J-folded film whereby to provide a flap <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> adjacent one end of the double compartment bag. As also hereinshown, one compartment, herein compartment <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, may be larger than compartment <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> depending on its intended use. A typical use of such bag is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> wherein in compartment <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> there may be disposed a cereal <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and wherein the flap <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> provides finger support, such as illustrated by reference to numeral <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, to permit the compartment <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> to be held in the fashion herein illustrated to insert a liquid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> within the bag and to eat the cereal. A plastic spoon <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> may also be provided in the compartment together with the cereal <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. The other compartment may include a sandwich or other condiment. Gusseted sections <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed adjacent opposed zippers <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>&prime; t permit the compartments to expand when a product is inserted in the compartments. Of course, only one gusset fold may be provided, and these are formed as described above. </paragraph>

As also illustrated, the bag is herein formed with two spaced-apart transverse seal lines <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> to define a narrow panel region <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> between the two inner compartments <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Because opposed ends of the folded film sheet are closed ends <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to form perforated tear lines <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> adjacent both these ends to permit access to the zipper closures <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrate the utility of the narrow panel <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and as hereinshown, it facilitates folding the two compartment sections together, as illustrated more clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to form a more compact package to insert within a lunchbox or an outer carton enclosure, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Although not described herein, it is conceivable that a two-compartment bag be formed with opposed flaps having wicket pin holes and this can be achieved by overlying two plastic film sheets one exceeding opposed ends of the other to provide the flaps. Zippers can then be applied adjacent the edges of the narrower panel adjacent the flaps. Adjacent the zipper of the narrow panel would be provided a flap section which can be engageable by bag opening and filling machines whereby to fill these bags with a food product and then re-seal the zipper. The bag is then manipulated so that the other compartment is filled by similar mechanism. Gussetted end walls could also be formed. However, the intent of the double compartment bag is more for domestic use in packaging different type foodstuff in a single bag and isolated from one another. </paragraph>
