<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An improved pitching machine is provided. The invented pitching machine may be capable of consecutively throwing balls that each have a different predetermined trajectory, rotational velocity, and velocity, without resetting the machine. The machine may be capable of simulating a pitch sequence, as thrown by a pitcher in a game situation, which may effectively train batters. The machine includes a pair of rotating belts that are vertically spaced and extend parallel to each other and generally horizontally. Once a ball is seized between the belts, the ball is rapidly conveyed by the belts and thrown in a predetermined direction and at a selected velocity. The velocity of the belts may be independently adjusted for imparting a predetermined rotational velocity on balls conveyed by the belts, for throwing balls of different predetermined trajectories. A control system is provided for selecting a pitch type for each ball thrown by the machine. The control system is used to select the velocity of each belt and horizontal and vertical inclination of the belts to enable the machine to throw balls of selected pitch types. The control system can be activated between each ball thrown, so that each consecutive ball thrown may have a different pitch type. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to devices used to propel balls, and more particularly, to a pitching machine that can make dynamic pitch changes in real-time and that significantly reduces deterioration typically suffered by the balls used in such machines. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Pitching machines are well known in the prior art. Pitching machines have long been used for propelling, or throwing spherical balls, such as baseballs, softballs, and tennis balls for example, or oval balls such as a football. Primarily pitching machines are used for throwing baseballs and softballs during activities such as batting practice, where the pitching machine is used to simulate a human pitcher. Modern pitching machines can effectively throw most pitch types thrown by today&apos;s pitchers including fastballs, curveballs, sliders, knuckle-balls, and change-ups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, known pitching machines require setup for each type of pitch thrown, and must be reset for each different pitch type desired to be thrown to the batter. For instance, if it is desired to throw fastballs to a batter, the pitching machine is setup to throw fastballs. When it is desired to throw another type of pitch to the batter, such as curveballs, the machine is stopped and then re-sets for throwing balls of the new pitch type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another disadvantage of known pitching machines is that there is a substantial time delay between throwing different type pitches, due to the time required for resetting the machine. A more important disadvantage, is that the batter knows exactly what type of pitch is being thrown and can adjust their swing and stance for the anticipated speed and location of the pitch. In a game situation, the batter must be prepared for any type of pitch that may be thrown by the pitcher. Thus, pitching machine capable of consecutively throwing different type pitches, without requiring re-setup for the different type pitches to effectively simulate a game situation, would be advantageous over the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Known pitching machines include a pitching assembly that is supported by a base that may be a tripod or other suitable configuration. The pitching assembly may be coupled to the base such that the pitching assembly may pivot, or swivel, about on the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The pitching assembly typically includes a motor that may drive at least one ball throwing wheel. In a first common embodiment, one ball throwing wheel is provided for propelling, or throwing, balls. A fixed pad may be positioned adjacent to a confronting surface of the wheel to form a constricting space therebetween. A ball infeed chute may be coupled to the pad and is positioned to deliver the ball into the constricting space. The motor rotates the wheel at a desired speed to propel, or throw, the ball therefrom at a selected velocity. When a ball is placed in the infeed chute, the ball is momentarily seized between the pad and rotating wheel. The confronting surface of the rotating wheel instantly draws the ball across the pad and propels the ball in a desired direction and at the selected velocity. The line on which the ball is propelled between the pad and wheel is adjustable about a horizontal axis and the speed of the wheel is variable to adjust the trajectory of the thrown ball. Thus, the pitching assembly can be adjusted for throwing balls higher or lower and closer to, or farther from, a desired object such as a batter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another common embodiment, the pitching assembly includes a pair of throwing wheels spaced a distance apart and mounted on a base for axial rotation in a common plane. The space between the confronting surface of the wheels is less than the diameter of a ball to be thrown. A first wheel is rotated in a first direction, such as clockwise and a second wheel is rotated in an opposing direction, such as counterclockwise. The ball infeed chute is mounted for rotational adjustment about the ball projecting line between the spaced wheels for rotational adjustment about the ball projecting line between the spaced wheels. This maintains the infeed chute in a gravity feeding position irrespective of the angular disposition of the common plane of the ball projecting wheels. When a ball is placed in the infeed chute, the ball is momentarily seized between the two rotating wheels and thrown in the desired direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Electrical controls are provided for controlling the rotational speeds of the two coacting wheels. The controls may be adjusted to enable the pitching assembly to throw different types of pitches. The controls may comprise potentiometers, or other known means, to independently vary the rotational speed of each wheel. Rotating each wheel at a different speed causes balls thrown thereby to have curvilinear trajectories. A variety of different ball throwing wheels have been tried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A disadvantage of known pitching assemblies, and in particular, their ball throwing wheels is that they are somewhat destructive to baseballs used in the machines. Since the balls are abruptly seized by the confronting surfaces of the ball throwing wheels or the fixed pad, the balls tend to be abraded during use. Thus, the life span of baseballs used by prior art pitching machines may be substantially reduced. Furthermore, the delivery of a ball to the strike zone from a standard pitching distance can vary by more than <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> inches from one pitch to the next. There are a number of possible sources of inaccuracy. For example, a slight out of balance on one wheel, a variation in hardness between the wheels, and the alignment of the stitches on the ball when the ball contacts the wheel, are some of the possible sources of error inherent in the design of pitching wheel machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Thus, there exists a need for a pitching machine that is capable of accurately consecutively throwing different type pitches, without requiring manual resetting of the machine between different pitch types, that can switch pitch types relatively quickly, and that does not significantly reduce the life span of baseballs used in the machine. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises an improved device for propelling, or throwing balls in a desired trajectory and at a selected velocity, commonly known as a pitching machine. The pitching machine of the present invention is capable of consecutively propelling, or throwing balls, each ball having a different predetermined trajectory, rotation, and velocity that characterize a desired kind of pitch, without resetting the machine. The pitching machine is capable of consecutively, and in any desired order, throwing several balls having different known pitch types including fastballs, curveballs, sliders, knuckle-balls, and change-ups, without resetting the machine and without unnecessary time delay therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The pitching machine may be capable of simulating a pitch sequence, a number of balls thrown with each ball potentially having a different pitch type (different trajectory, rotation, and velocity), as if thrown by a human pitcher during an at-bat in a game situation. During an at-bat in a game, a batter does not know what type of pitch is being thrown and cannot pre-adjust their swing and stance for an anticipated speed, trajectory, and location of the pitch. Since the invented pitching machine is capable of consecutively throwing balls of different pitch types, without requiring resetting therebetween, the invented machine may be capable of more effectively training batters, as compared to prior art pitching machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The pitching machine of the present invention comprises a pitching assembly that may be pivotably coupled to a base. The base may be a tripod, or other appropriate configuration that supports the pitching assembly a desired distance above the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The pitching assembly includes a ball throwing assembly coupled to a support plate. The ball throwing assembly may comprise a pair of belt assemblies that are vertically spaced and extend generally horizontally along the support plate and are coupled thereto. Each belt assembly may comprise a front pulley and a rear pulley and a belt that extends around both pulleys and generally horizontally along the plate. Each belt assembly may additionally include a motor that may drive, or rotate, at least one pulley at a desired speed for rotating the belt coupled to the pulley. Thus, a pair of vertically spaced belts that rotate generally horizontally along the support plate for propelling or throwing balls are provided by the invented ball throwing assembly. The use of two roughly parallel belts allows may reduce the number of potential sources of inaccuracy, compared to other kinds of pitching machine designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A ball infeed chute is positioned adjacent to the rear pulleys of the belt assemblies. The infeed chute has an outlet positioned to dispose balls into the space between the two rotating belts. When a ball is placed in the infeed chute, the ball falls through the outlet of the chute and is seized between the two rotating belts. The ball is rapidly conveyed by the rotating belts toward the front pulleys. Once the ball reaches the front pulleys, the ball is propelled, or thrown, in a predetermined direction and at a selected velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Conveyance of the ball by the belts, as opposed to momentarily seizing the ball between two rotating wheels or between a rotating wheel and a fixed pad, may reduce wear on balls used by the invented machine and increase the life span of the balls. Additionally, since balls are conveyed by the belts for a brief time period, as opposed to being momentarily seized between two wheels, the balls may be more accurately thrown toward a desired target. The rotational speed of the two spaced belts may be independently adjusted for imparting a desired rotation on balls. As the baseballs are conveyed for a brief time by the two rotating belts, it may also be possible to accelerate the baseball over the period of time, during which the baseball is between the rotating belts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The support plate may be rotated around three axis, x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. The x-axis runs horizontally along a path roughly parallel to the long axis of the belts and between the belts. Rotation around the x-axis (roll) allows the angle of the spin imparted to the ball to be varied. The y-axis is vertical and rotation around the y axis (yaw) allows left and right horizontal adjustment in the direction the ball is propelled. The z-axis is horizontal, but perpendicular to the x-axis. Rotation around the z-axis allows adjustment to the vertical inclination of the trajectory of the ball. Thus, the pitching machine of the present invention may be capable of throwing balls having different predetermined selected trajectories, velocities, and rotational velocities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A control system may be provided for selecting a predetermined pitch type for each ball to be thrown by the invented pitching machine. The control system may be capable of either increasing or decreasing the rotational speed of either belt or both belts simultaneously. The control system may further be capable of rotating the support plate around the x-axis and rotating the plate around the y-axis. Thus, the control system may be used to select a desired rotational speed of each belt and horizontal position, vertical inclination, and roll position, of the throwing assembly, to enable the invented pitching machine to throw a ball of a predetermined pitch type. The control system may be activated between each ball thrown, so that each consecutive ball thrown may have a different predetermined trajectory, rotation, and velocity, and thus pitch type, without resetting the machine. Therefore, the pitching machine of the present invention is capable of consecutively throwing balls of different pitch types, which may more effectively train batters. The control system may be operated by remote control or it may be programmed to throw a predetermined series of pitches.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention and sets forth the best modes presently contemplated by the inventor of carrying out the invention. Various modifications, however, will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art, since the generic principles of the present invention have been defined herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a first preferred embodiment of an improved device for propelling, or throwing balls in a desired direction and at a selected velocity, commonly known as a pitching machine. The pitching machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is capable of consecutively propelling, or throwing, balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> each with a different predetermined trajectory, velocity, and rotational velocity, that characterize the pitch type of the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being thrown, without significantly interrupting a pitch sequence to reset the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> During an at-bat in a game, a batter does not know what type of pitch is being thrown and cannot pre-adjust their swing and stance for an anticipated speed, trajectory, and location of the pitch. The invented pitching machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be capable of simulating a pitch sequence, a number of balls thrown with each ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> potentially having a different pitch type (different trajectory, rotational velocity, and velocity), as if thrown by a human pitcher during an at-bat in a game situation. Therefore, the invented machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be capable of effectively training batters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, the drawings, the pitching machine of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a pitching assembly, shown generally at <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, that may be pivotably coupled to a support stand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The support stand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of legs or support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, that support a base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are configured in a known tripod configuration. Alternatively, the support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be assembled in other known configurations for supporting the pitching assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> a desired distance above a ground surface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In other alternate embodiments, castors or wheels may be secured to the support members <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to facilitate transporting of the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The support stand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be fabricated using well known methods and any suitable materials, including wood, plastics, and metal alloys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A pivot plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be provided to couple the pitching assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A plurality of bearings may be interposed between the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a bottom surface of the pivot plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, to provide a bearing surface for the pivot plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The pivot plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may further include a pair of opposed upstanding arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that couple to the pitching assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B</cross-reference>, the pitching assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may include a ball throwing assembly, shown generally at <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, that includes a support plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The ball throwing assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may further include a pair of belt assemblies <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B that are spaced along a vertical y-axis and extend generally parallel to a horizontal x-axis. The support plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may comprise a metal alloy, or other appropriate strong, durable, and rigid material, and may be fabricated using know methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Each belt assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B may include a front pulley <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and a rear pulley <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that are coupled to the support plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A belt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B that extends around the front and rear pulleys <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and generally parallel to the x-axis is also provided with each assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B. In the preferred embodiment, each belt assembly includes a belt guide <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> interposed between the front and rear pulleys <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The belt guides <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> preferably include a suspension system that allow the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B to be adjusted to small differences in the diameters of the balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Any desired suspension system may be used. A preferred embodiment is best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, which shows the belt guides <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> including a slider plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> lying over a compressible material <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The slider plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is preferably formed of a material selected to provide a low coefficient of friction when contacted by the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B. The compressible material <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is preferably some kind of foam rubber or other similar material, or in alternate embodiments, springs may be used. In use, the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B run in the grooves of the belt guides <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on top of the slider plates <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The suspension assembly allows the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B to self-adjust vertically to accommodate slightly different ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> diameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Preferably the front and rear pulleys <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are configured with a flat periphery, with rims <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to guide the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B. The upper surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B are preferably concave. Each belt assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B may include a motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 3B</cross-reference>) that drives, or rotates, at least one of the front pulley <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and rear pulley <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> at a desired speed for rotating the belt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B coupled to the pulley at a predetermined velocity. Preferably, each motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extends through an aperture <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in the support plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and is secured to the plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by a stand-off bracket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Any of a variety of known and commercially available motors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be used. In a preferred embodiment, the motors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may comprise commercially available electric motors, such as model <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> manufactured by Applied Industrial Technologies, with preferably a maximum output of approximately 3000 RPM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Additionally, each motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may have an encoder <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> coupled thereto. The encoder <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> may be provided to enable activation and control of the motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> remotely (to be thoroughly discussed further below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Each motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> rotates a drive pulley <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that may be coupled to one of the front and rear pulleys <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by means of a drive belt <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The rear pulley <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of each belt assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B includes a hub disk <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> attached to a hub <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> thereof. The drive belt <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> extends about the drive pulley <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of each motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the corresponding hub disk <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of each rear pulley <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to couple the motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the respective rear pulley <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for rotating the pulley and thus driving the belt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B coupled thereto. The stand-off bracket or motor mounting <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> aids in aligning the drive pulley <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with the hub disk <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> of the drawings, the drive pulley <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may have a diameter greater than the hub disk <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. However, it is to be understood that the drive pulley <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and hub disk <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be different predetermined diameters relative to one another, so long as a desired efficiency of each motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and selected velocity of belt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is achievable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the front pulley <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of each belt assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B may be similarly coupled to the motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and driven thereby, as opposed to the rear pulley <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In a further alternative embodiment, both the front pulley <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and rear pulley <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for rotation by the motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The belt assemblies <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B are positioned on the support plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, so that a space <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is provided between the two belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B. The space <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> between is dimensioned with a diameter that is slightly less than the diameter of balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be propelled by the pitching machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the concave cross-sectional configuration of the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B mates with the periphery of balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> conveyed thereby, to positively engage the balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and to impart a selected rotational velocity on the balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, when it is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring again to, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 2A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, a ball infeed chute <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be provided to feed balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the space <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> between the two rotating belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B. The infeed chute <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may comprise an arcuate tube that has an inlet end <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> positioned a distance away from the belt assemblies <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B and an outlet end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> positioned adjacent to the rear pulley <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of each belt assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B, and aligned with the space <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to dispose balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the space <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> between the two rotating belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B. The chute <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> preferably has a diameter greater than balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> placed therein. The diameter of the chute <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> allows balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> placed in the chute <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to rapidly pass through the chute <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and out through the outlet end <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to be seized between the two rotating belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B adjacent to the rear pulleys <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of each assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In use, each ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is seized between the two rotating belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B and rapidly conveyed by the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B toward the front pulleys <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B convey the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a velocity determined by the speed that each motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> rotates the drive pulley <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> coupled thereto for driving the corresponding rear pulley <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Once the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reaches point on the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B, were the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B diverge from one another and begin extending about the periphery of the front pulleys <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is propelled, or thrown, in a predetermined direction and at a selected velocity, determined by the velocity of the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B. A selected one of the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B may be driven by the corresponding motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> at a velocity greater or less than the other belt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B. This causes a ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> conveyed by the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B to rotate as it is conveyed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Inducing a rotational velocity on the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and increasing or decreasing the rotational velocity thereof, will alter the trajectory of the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> once it is propelled by the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Since balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are conveyed for a time by the two rotating belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B, a predetermined rotational velocity may be imparted on the balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for throwing a ball with a predetermined trajectory and selected pitch type. Conveyance of balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B, may reduce wear on balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> used by the invented machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and thus increase the life span of the balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Additionally, since balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are conveyed by the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B for a brief time period, as opposed to being momentarily seized between two wheels, the balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be more accurately thrown toward a desired target. In alternate embodiments it may be desirable to change the velocity of rotating belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B over time as the ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> travels from adjacent the rear pulleys <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> toward the front pulleys <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The box <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is pivotally attached to the upstanding arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the pivot plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The pivotal attachment of the box <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to the pivot plate&apos;s <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> upstanding arms <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> allows the box to tilt up or down and thereby change he vertical angle of trajectory of a thrown ball. Also, the support plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is pivotally attached to the box <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The pivotal attachment of the support plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the box <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> allows the support plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to tilt side to side and thereby change the curve or rotational direction of a thrown ball with respect to the path between the pitching machine and person hitting. Additionally, the box <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is configured with an aperture <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to allow balls propelled by the ball throwing assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to pass through the box <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. An annular guide <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be affixed to an inner surface <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the box <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and around the periphery of the aperture <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, such that the annular guide <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> extends inwardly toward the space <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> between the two rotating belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B and adjacent to the front pulley <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of each belt assembly <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B.

In the first embodiment, the remote control device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> communicates with the transceivers of each motor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and or the on board computer via an infrared transmitter <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. In the second embodiment, the remote control device <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> communicates with the transceivers of each motor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>018</bold></highlight>, and or an on board computer via a cable <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Each of the remote control devices <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are constructed using methods and materials well known in the art and contain circuitry that enable the particular functionalities thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In use, an initial setup of the invented machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is performed and the control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is programmed to throw each pitch in the pitch select mode. Once the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is at an installation site, a user must first level the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The LEVEL button is first pressed, then the Y-AXIS button is depressed for adjusting the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> vertically. The plus (&plus;) or minus (&minus;) buttons may then be pressed to adjust the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> vertically. This procedure is repeated for adjusting the pitching machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> horizontally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The user then must indicate to the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> where a desired target, such as a desired strike zone, is located. This is performed by first measuring the distance to the target, which may be a home plate for example, and establishing desired parameters of the strike zone. The control system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is then activated to throw a few balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> towards the target and in the strike zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> If the balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are wide of the target, either left or right, the x-axis is adjusted by first depressing the SK-ZN button, then the X-AXIS button. The plus (&plus;) or minus (&minus;) buttons may then be pressed and then the JOG button is repeatedly pressed to adjust the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> horizontally as necessary. If the balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are too high or too low of the target, the y-axis is adjusted by first depressing the SK-ZN button, then the Y-AXIS button. The plus (&plus;) or minus (&minus;) buttons may then be pressed and then the JOG button is repeatedly pressed to adjust the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> vertically as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Once the desired location of the balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been achieved, the selection for each pitch type is tested. If correction of a selected pitch type is required, the above-described procedures can be repeated for each pitch type. If the spin of a curve ball, for example, requires adjustment, the speed of the ball throwing assembly&apos;s motors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be adjusted. The button for the appropriate motor is first depressed, then plus (&plus;) or minus (&minus;) buttons may then be pressed and then the JOG button is repeatedly pressed to adjust the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to increase or decrease the velocity of the corresponding belt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B as necessary. Once the desired velocity of the belt <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B is achieved, the ENTER button is pressed to store in memory the desired velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A custom pitch type is created by first pressing the CUSTOM button. Then the category of the pitch is selected. Next, the desired horizontal and vertical inclinations and speeds of the belts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B are selected. The created pitch is then assigned a three-digit number that is entered with the numeric keypad <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of these set-up procedures, the invented pitching machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of throwing balls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of programmed pitch types including fastballs, curveballs, sliders, knuckle-balls, and change-ups, for example. The remote control unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is activated by pressing any button located in the pitch selection keypad. Once such pitch is selected, it will be delivered to the hitter. A different pitch selection button may be pressed for each consecutive ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thrown, so that each consecutive ball <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thrown may have a different predetermined trajectory, rotation, and velocity, thus the pitch type. Additionally or alternatively, the invention may include a memory means, such as a memory chip, capable of storing a string or series of preprogrammed pitches that are executed sequentially or in a random order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Thus, there has been described an improved pitching machine. The invented pitching machine may be capable of consecutively throwing balls that each have a different predetermined trajectory, rotational velocity, and velocity, without resetting the machine. The machine may be capable of simulating a pitch sequence, as thrown by a pitcher in a game situation, which may effectively train batters. The velocity of the belts may be independently adjusted for throwing balls of different predetermined trajectories. The control system is used to select the velocity of each belt and horizontal and vertical inclination of the belts to enable the machine to throw balls of selected pitch types. The control system can be activated between each thrown ball so that each consecutive ball thrown may have a different pitch type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various adaptations and modifications of the just-described preferred embodiments can be configured without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Therefore, it is to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced other than as specifically described herein. </paragraph>
