<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a catalytic reformer and method for converting a hydrocarbon stream to a reformate fuel stream comprising hydrogen; more particularly, to a fast light-off catalytic reformer and method for rapid production of reformate for hydrogen coldstart in an internal combustion engine; and most particularly, to a method for quenching a start-up combustion reaction in the reformer prior to initiating reforming of fuel. The present invention is useful for providing reformate to a fuel cell, and especially a solid oxide fuel cell. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A catalytic hydrocarbon fuel reformer converts a fuel stream comprising, for example, natural gas, light distillates, methanol, propane, naphtha, kerosene, gasoline, diesel fuel, or combinations thereof, and air, into a hydrogen-rich reformate fuel stream comprising a gaseous blend of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and nitrogen (ignoring trace components). In the reforming process, the raw hydrocarbon fuel stream is typically percolated with oxygen in the form of air through a catalyst bed or beds contained within reactor tubes mounted in the reformer vessel. The catalytic conversion process is typically carried out at elevated catalyst temperatures in the range of about 700&deg; C. to about 1100&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The produced hydrogen-rich reformate stream may be used, for example, as the fuel gas stream feeding the anode of an electrochemical fuel cell after passing the reformate stream through a water gas shift reactor and/or other purification means such as a carbon monoxide selective oxidizer. Reformate is particularly well suited to fueling a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system because the purification step for removal of carbon monoxide is not required for an SOFC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> During operation of most reformers of this type, tail gas from the fuel cell is burned and the burner exhaust passes through a plenum within the vessel, contacting and heating the outer surface of the reactor tubes and thereby heating the catalyst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The hydrogen-rich reformate stream may also be used as a hydrogen fuel to fuel a spark-ignited (SI) engine, either alone or in combination with gasoline. Hydrogen-fueled vehicles are of interest as low-emissions vehicles because hydrogen as a fuel or a fuel additive can significantly reduce air pollution and can be produced from a variety of fuels. Hydrogen permits an engine to run with very lean fuel-air mixtures that greatly reduce production of NOx. As a gasoline additive, small amounts of supplemental hydrogen fuel may allow conventional gasoline internal combustion engines to reach nearly zero emissions levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A problem in the past has been how to elevate the temperature of the catalyst quickly in order to begin generating reformate in the shortest possible time. An approach disclosed in the parent to this application is to incorporate into the reformer a &ldquo;fast light-off&rdquo; system wherein a fuel/air mixture, essentially stoichiometric, is ignited in the reformer, preferably upstream of the catalyst, for a brief period at start-up. The exhaust gas, passing through the reformer in contact with the catalyst, heats the catalyst very rapidly. Such combustion typically is needed for only a few seconds, after which ignition is terminated and the mixture is made very fuel-rich for reforming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A problem exists, however, in how to make the transition from the fuel-lean mixture and combustion to the fuel-rich mixture and reforming. It is desirable to extinguish combustion before changing over from lean to rich mixture to prevent brief but intense coking of the catalyst surfaces caused by burning the rich mixture. However, simply stopping ignition has been found to be insufficient. One approach has been to include a flame arrestor between the combustion chamber and the reformer, which approach can be successful in preventing coking but also has been found to reduce very substantially and undesirably the rate at which the pre-combustion heats the catalyst, thus extending undesirably the start-up period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> What is needed is a means for changing over from combustion mode to reforming mode very quickly without a flame arrestor and also without coking of the catalyst surfaces. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A fast light-off catalytic reformer and method for fast start-up is provided. The reformer includes at least one reactor tube having an inlet for receiving a flow of fuel and a flow of air, a reforming catalyst disposed within the reactor tube for converting the fuel and air to a reformate stream, and an outlet for discharging the produced reformate stream. An ignition device is disposed within the reactor tube for initiating an exothermic reaction between the fuel and air. Heat generated thereby warms the catalyst to provide fast light-off of the reformer. An associated control system selects fuel and air flow delivery rates and operates the ignition device so as to achieve fast light-off of the reforming catalyst at start-up and to maintain the catalyst at a temperature sufficient to optimize reformate yield. The system operates at a lean fuel/air mixture during ignition and combustion mode, then switches over to a rich fuel/air mixture during reforming mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A method for starting up and switching over the mixtures includes supplying a flow of lean fuel/air mixture to the catalytic reformer; igniting the lean mixture within the reactor tube for a brief period of time, preferably less than about 2 seconds, to rapidly heat the reforming catalyst with the heat of combustion; stopping ignition; stopping completely the flow of fuel into the reactor tube for a short period of time, preferably between about 100 and 200 milliseconds; and restoring the flow of fuel at a rich fuel/mixture suitable for reforming. The present method provides the advantage of rapid production of high yields of reformate by not coking the catalyst during mixture changeover and is particularly useful for on-board fuel reforming in meeting SULEV emissions with spark-ignition engines, especially with larger, high-emissions vehicles. The present fast light-off reformer and method is also well suited for providing rapid production of reformate to other power generation systems, such as fuel cells, and is particularly useful for start up and fueling solid oxide fuel cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and other features and advantages of the invention will be more fully understood from the following description of certain specific embodiments of the invention taken together with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> fast light-off catalytic reformer <highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight> in accordance with one possible embodiment of the present invention includes a reactor tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having an inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a first end for receiving a flow of fuel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a flow of air <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, shown as combined fuel-air mixture <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Reactor tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be any shape, but preferably comprises a substantially cylindrical reactor tube. While the present description discusses a single reactor tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, reforming catalyst <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and ignition device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the present fast light-off reformer may comprise more than one reactor tube, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Reforming catalyst <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is disposed within reactor tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may comprise any reforming catalyst material suitable for converting the fuel feedstock and air to reformate, including, but not limited to, for example, rhodium, platinum, their alloys, and combinations thereof. Preferably, a protective coating or firewall (not shown) is disposed about catalyst <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. During operation, a fuel-rich mixture comprising air and a liquid hydrocarbon fuel such as natural gas, light distillates, methanol, propane, naphtha, kerosene, gasoline, diesel fuel, or combinations thereof, is converted by catalyst <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to a hydrogen rich reformate fuel stream <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that is discharged through outlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Ignition device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is disposed within the reactor tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to initiate an exothermic reaction in fuel and air flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Heat generated by this reaction is used to provide fast light-off (i.e., extremely rapid heating) of reforming catalyst <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The ignition device preferably is located upstream of the catalyst, but may alternatively be located at the front face thereof, within the catalyst, or at the rear face of the catalyst. In a preferred embodiment, the ignition device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is disposed within the reactor tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> upstream of the reforming catalyst <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, i.e., between inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and reforming catalyst <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Ignition device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be any device suitable for initiating exothermic reactions between fuel and air <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, including, but not limited to, a catalytic or non-catalytic substrate, such as a wire or gauze as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, for receiving electric current from a voltage source; a spark plug; a glow plug; or any combination thereof. An associated control system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> selects and maintains the appropriate fuel and air delivery rates and operates the ignition device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to achieve fast light off of the reforming catalyst <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at start-up and to maintain catalyst <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at a temperature sufficient to optimize reformate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> yield. The control means used herein may comprise any of various control means known in the art for providing air and fuel control and metering functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Excellent reformate yields from the reactor depend upon both a sufficiently high catalyst temperature and the appropriate fuel:air ratio. The optimum fuel/air mixture for producing reformate is very fuel rich, but leaner mixtures provide higher temperatures for rapidly heating the catalyst. Control system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> varies the fuel:air ratio during start-up of the reformer as described below to rapidly obtain both the temperatures and fuel/air mixtures required for reforming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference>, in a method for starting up a reformer <highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight>, control system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> directs flows of fuel and air into reactor tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at first predetermined fuel and air flow rates to provide a near-stoichiometric lean fuel/air mixture at a first fuel:air mass flow ratio <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. Such lean flow continues for a first predetermined period of time <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, generally less than ten seconds and preferably less than about 2 seconds, during which time the mixture is periodically ignited by ignition device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to produce flame and hot exhaust which sweeps through and heats catalyst <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. At the end of this period of time <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, both the flow of fuel into reactor tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and ignition of the fuel mixture are terminated. Fuel flow is stopped for a second predetermined period of time <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, generally less than five seconds and preferably between about 100 and 200 about milliseconds, allowing combustion to cease, thereby preventing ignition of subsequent fuel-rich mixture and coking or fouling of the catalyst surfaces. Fuel flow is then re-established by control system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at a second predetermined flow rate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&Prime; to provide a fuel-rich mixture for reforming, preferably at a second fuel:air ratio of about 2.5:1 to about 5:1 and preferably about 3:1 with respect to the first fuel/air ratio. Air flow may also be readjusted by control system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in providing the desired first and second flow ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the benefit of a reformer without a flame arrestor is shown. Curve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shows the catalyst heating rate in a typical reformer having a flame arrestor between the ignition point and the catalyst. Curve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> shows the higher heating rate found in an identical reformer without such a flame arrestor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present fast light-off catalytic reformer and method produce rapid, high yields of reformate fuel. The produced reformate may be bottled in a vessel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or used to fuel any number of systems operating partially or wholly on reformate fuel. Such power generation systems <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may include, but are not limited to, engines such as spark ignition engines, hybrid vehicles, diesel engines, fuel cells, particularly solid oxide fuel cells, or combinations thereof. The present fast light-off reformer and method may be variously integrated with such systems, as desired. For example, the present fast light-off reformer may be employed as an on-board reformer for a vehicle engine operating wholly or partially on reformate, the engine having a fuel inlet in fluid communication with the reformer outlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for receiving reformate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> therefrom. The present fast light-off reformer and method is particularly suitable for use as an on-board reformer for quickly generating reformate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for initial start-up of a system. The present reformer and method are particularly advantageous for hydrogen cold-start of an internal combustion engine, providing a supply of hydrogen-rich reformate which allows the engine exhaust to meet SULEV emissions levels immediately from cold-start. Vehicles wherein a fast light-off reformer operated in accordance with the present invention is useful may include automobiles, trucks, and other land vehicles, boats and ships, and aircraft including spacecraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described by reference to certain preferred embodiments, it should be understood that numerous changes may be made within the spirit and scope of the inventive concepts described. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the disclosed embodiments, but that it have the full scope permitted by the language of the following claims. </paragraph>
