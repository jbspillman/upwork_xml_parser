<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present inventions relate to the fabrication and placement of materials at known locations on a substrate. In particular, one embodiment of the invention provides a method and associated apparatus for packaging a substrate having diverse sequences at known locations on its surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Techniques for forming sequences on a substrate are known. For example, the sequences may be formed according to the pioneering techniques disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854 (Pirrung et al.), PCT WO 92/10092, or U.S. application Ser. No. 08/249,188, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,639, incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. The prepared substrates will have a wide range of applications. For example, the substrates may be used for understanding the structure-activity relationship between different materials or determining the sequence of an unknown material. The sequence of such unknown material may be determined by, for example, a process known as sequencing by hybridization. In one method of sequencing by hybridization, a sequences of diverse materials are formed at known locations on the surface of a substrate. A solution containing one or more targets to be sequenced is applied to the surface of the substrate. The targets will bind or hybridize with only complementary sequences on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The locations at which hybridization occurs can be detected with appropriate detection systems by labeling the targets with a fluorescent dye, radioactive isotope, enzyme, or other marker. Exemplary systems are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854 (Pirrung et al.) and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/143,312, also incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Information regarding target sequences can be extracted from the data obtained by such detection systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> By combining various available technologies, such as photolithography and fabrication techniques, substantial progress has been made in the fabrication and placement of diverse materials on a substrate. For example, thousands of different sequences may be fabricated on a single substrate of about 1.28 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in only a small fraction of the time required by conventional methods. Such improvements make these substrates practical for use in various applications, such as biomedical research, clinical diagnostics, and other industrial markets, as well as the emerging field of genomics, which focuses on determining the relationship between genetic sequences and human physiology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As commercialization of such substrates becomes widespread, an economically feasible and high-throughput device and method for packaging the substrates are desired. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Methods and devices for packaging a substrate having an array of probes fabricated on its surface are disclosed. In some embodiments, a body containing a cavity is provided. A substrate having an array of probes is attached to the cavity using, for example, an adhesive. The body includes inlets that allow fluids into and through the cavity. A seal is provided for each inlet to retain the fluid within the cavity. An opening is formed below the cavity to receive a temperature controller for controlling the temperature in the cavity. By forming a sealed thermostatically controlled chamber in which fluids can easily be introduced, a practical medium for sequencing by hybridization is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, the body is formed by acoustically welding two pieces together. The concept of assembling the body from two pieces is advantageous. For example, the various features of the package (i.e., the channels, sealing means, and orientation means) are formed without requiring complex machining or designing. Thus, the packages are produced at a relatively low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In connection with one aspect of the invention, a method for making the chip package is disclosed. In particular, the method comprises the steps of first forming a plurality of probe arrays on a substrate and separating the substrate into a plurality of chips. Typically, each chip contains at least one probe array. A chip is then mated to a package having a reaction chamber with fluid inlets. When mated, the probe array is in fluid communication with the reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides an apparatus for packaging a substrate. The present apparatus includes a substrate having a first surface and a second surface. The first surface includes a probe array and the second surface is an outer periphery of the first surface. The present apparatus also includes a body having a mounting surface, an upper surface, and a cavity bounded by the mounting surface and the upper surface. The second surface is attached to the cavity and the first surface is within the cavity. A cover attached to the mounting surface for defining an upper boundary to the cavity is also included. The cavity includes a diffuser and a concentrator. The diffuser and the concentrator permit laminar fluid flow through the cavity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> I. Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The following terms are intended to have the following general meanings as they are used herein: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> 1. Probe: A probe is a surface-immobilized molecule that is recognized by a particular target and is sometimes referred to as a ligand. Examples of probes that can be investigated by this invention include, but are not restricted to, agonists and antagonists for cell membrane receptors, toxins and venoms, viral epitopes, hormones (e.g., opioid peptides, steroids, etc.), hormone receptors, peptides, enzymes, enzyme substrates, cofactors, drugs, lectins, sugars, oligonucleotides or nucleic acids, oligosaccharides, proteins, and monoclonal antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> 2. Target: A target is a molecule that has an affinity for a given probe and is sometimes referred to as a receptor. Targets may be naturally-occurring or manmade molecules. Also, they can be employed in their unaltered state or as aggregates with other species. Targets may be attached, covalently or noncovalently, to a binding member, either directly or via a specific binding substance. Examples of targets which can be employed by this invention include, but are not restricted to, antibodies, cell membrane receptors, monoclonal antibodies and antisera reactive with specific antigenic determinants (such as on viruses, cells or other materials), drugs, oligonucleotides or nucleic acids, peptides, cofactors, lectins, sugars, polysaccharides, cells, cellular membranes, and organelles. Targets are sometimes referred to in the art as anti-probes or anti-ligands. As the term &ldquo;targets&rdquo; is used herein, no difference in meaning is intended. A &ldquo;Probe Target Pair&rdquo; is formed when two macromolecules have combined through molecular recognition to form a complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> II. General </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides economical and efficient packaging devices for a substrate having an array of probes fabricated thereon. The probe arrays may be fabricated according to the pioneering techniques disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854 (Pirrung et al.), PCT WO 92/10092, or U.S. application Ser. No. 08/249,188 filed May 24, 1994, already incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. According to one aspect of the techniques described therein, a plurality of probe arrays are immobilized at known locations on a large substrate or wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrates a wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on which numerous probe arrays <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are fabricated. The wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be composed of a wide range of material, either biological, nonbiological, organic, inorganic, or a combination of any of these, existing as particles, strands, precipitates, gels, sheets, tubing, spheres, containers, capillaries, pads, slices, films, plates, slides, etc. The wafer may have any convenient shape, such as a disc, square, sphere, circle, etc. The wafer is preferably flat but may take on a variety of alternative surface configurations. For example, the wafer may contain raised or depressed regions on which a sample is located. The wafer and its surface preferably form a rigid support on which the sample can be formed. The wafer and its surface are also chosen to provide appropriate light-absorbing characteristics. For instance, the wafer may be a polymerized Langmuir Blodgett film, functionalized glass, Si, Ge, GaAs, GaP, SiO2, SiN4, modified silicon, or any one of a wide variety of gels or polymers such as (poly)tetrafluoroethylene, (poly)vinylidenedifluoride, polystyrene, polycarbonate, or combinations thereof. Other materials with which the wafer can be composed of will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure. In a preferred embodiment, the wafer is flat glass or single-crystal silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Surfaces on the solid wafer will usually, though not always, be composed of the same material as the wafer. Thus, the surface may be composed of any of a wide variety of materials, for example, polymers, plastics, resins, polysaccharides, silica or silica-based materials, carbon, metals, inorganic glasses, membranes, or any of the above-listed wafer materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of marks <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> that are located in streets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (area adjacent to the probe arrays). Such marks may be used for aligning the masks during the probe fabrication process. In effect, the marks identify the location at which each array <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is to be fabricated. The probe arrays may be formed in any geometric shape. In some embodiments, the shape of the array may be squared to minimize wasted wafer area. After the probe arrays have been fabricated, the wafer is separated into smaller units known as chips. The wafer, for example, may be about 5&times;5 inches on which 16 probe arrays, each occupying an area of about 12.8 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, are fabricated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrates a chip that has been separated from the wafer. As illustrated, chip <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contains a probe array <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a plurality of alignment marks <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The marks serve multiple functions, such as: 1) aligning the masks for fabricating the probe arrays, 2) aligning the scriber for separating the wafer into chips, and 3) aligning the chip to the package during the attachment process. In some embodiments, such chips may be of the type known as Very Large Scale Immobilized Polymer Synthesis (VLSIPS&trade;) chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> According to a specific embodiment, the chip contains an array of genetic probes, such as an array of diverse RNA or DNA probes. In some embodiments, the probe array will be designed to detect or study a genetic tendency, characteristic, or disease. For example, the probe array may be designed to detect or identify genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis or certain cancers (such as P53 gene relevant to some cancers), as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/143,312, already incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the wafer is separated into a plurality of chips using a technique known as scribe and break. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrates a fully programmable computer controlled scribe and break device, which in some embodiments is a DX-III Scriber breaker manufactured by Dynatex International&trade;. As shown, the device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> with a rotation stage <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> on which a wafer is mounted. The rotation stage includes a vacuum chuck for fixing the wafer thereon. A stepper motor, which is controlled by the system, rotates stage <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Located above the stage is a head unit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> that includes a camera <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and cutter <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. Head unit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is mounted on a dual-axis frame. The camera generates an image of the wafer on video display <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The video display <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes a cross hair alignment mark <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. The camera, which includes a zoom lens and a fiber optic light, allows a user to inspect the wafer on the video display <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. A control panel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is located on the base for operating device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In operation, a user places a wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on a frame <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The surface of frame <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is composed of a flexible and sticky material. The tackiness of the frame prevents the chips from being dispersed and damaged during the breaking process. Frame <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be a pick and place frame or a hoop that is commonly associated with fabrication of semiconductors. Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a user places the frame with the wafer on the rotation stage <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the frame is held on the rotation stage by vacuum pressure. The user then aligns the wafer by examining the image displayed on the video display <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, wafer alignment is achieved in two steps. First, using the control panel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the user rotates stage <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The stage is rotated until streets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are aligned with the cross hair <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> on the display, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Next, the user moves the cutter until it is aligned at the center of one of the streets. This step is performed by aligning horizontal line <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of the cross hair between alignment marks <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Once the cutter is aligned, the user instructs the device to scribe the wafer. In some embodiments, various options are available to the user, such as scribe angle, scribe pressure, and scribe depth. These parameters will vary depending on the composition and/or thickness of the wafer. Preferably, the parameters are set to scribe and break the wafer without causing any damage thereto or penetrating through the frame. The device repeatedly scribes the wafer until all the streets in one axis have been scribed, which in one embodiment is repeated 5 times (a 4&times;4 matrix of probe arrays). The user then rotates the stage 90&deg; to scribe the perpendicular streets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Once the wafer has been scribed, the user instructs the device to break or separate the wafer into chips. Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> breaks the wafer by striking it beneath the scribe with an impulse bar located under the rotation table <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The shock from the impulse bar fractures the wafer along the scribe. Since most of the force is dissipated along the scribe, device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is able to produce high breaking forces without exerting significant forces on the wafer. Thus, the chips are separated without causing any damage to the wafer. Once separated, the chips are then packaged. Of course, other more conventional techniques, such as the sawing technique disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,855, incorporated herein by reference for all purposes, may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> III. Details of One Embodiment of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> a. Chip Package </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a device for packaging the chips. Package <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> contains a cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> on which a chip is mounted. The package includes inlets <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> which communicate with cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Fluids are circulated through the cavity via inlets <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. A septum, plug, or other seal may be employed to seal the fluids in the cavity. Alignment holes <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> may be provided for alignment purposes. In some embodiments, the package may include a non-flush edge <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In some detection systems, the packages may be inserted into a holder similar to an audio cassette tape. The asymmetrical design of the package will assure correct package orientation when inserted into the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of the package. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the chip package is manufactured by mating two substantially complementary casings <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to form finished assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Preferably, casings <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are made from injection molded plastic. Injection molding enables the casings to be formed inexpensively. Also, assembling the package from two parts simplifies the construction of various features, such as the internal channels for introducing fluids into the cavity. As a result, the packages may be manufactured at a relatively low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>show the top casing <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in greater detail. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a top view and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows a bottom view. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, top casing <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> includes an external planar surface <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> having a cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> therein. In some embodiments, the surface area of casing <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> sufficiently accommodates the cavity. Preferably, the top casing is of sufficient size to accommodate identification labels or bar codes in addition to the cavity. In a specific embodiment, the top casing is about 1.5&Prime; wide, 2&Prime; long, and 0.2&Prime; high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is usually, though not always, located substantially at the center of surface <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. The cavity may have any conceivable size, shape, or orientation. Preferably, the cavity is slightly smaller than the surface area of the chip to be placed thereon and has a volume sufficient to perform hybridization. In one embodiment, the cavity may be about 0.58&Prime; wide, 0.58&Prime; long, and 0.2&Prime; deep. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may include inlets <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. Selected fluids are introduced into and out of the cavity via the inlets. In some embodiments, the inlets are located at opposite ends of the cavity. This configuration improves fluid circulation and regulation of bubble formation in the cavity. The bubbles agitate the fluid, increasing the hybridization rate between the targets and complementary probe sequences. In one embodiment, the inlets are located at the top and bottom end of the cavity when the package is oriented vertically such as at the opposite corners of the cavity. Locating the inlet at the highest and lowest positions in the cavity facilitates the removal of bubbles from the cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>illustrates an alternative embodiment in which cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is oriented such that the edges of the cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the casing <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> are non-parallel. This configuration allows inlets <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> to be situated at the absolute highest and lowest locations in the cavity when the package is vertically oriented. As a result, bubbles or fluid droplets are prevented from being potentially trapped in the cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a depression <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> surrounds the cavity. In some embodiments, a ridge <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> may be provided at the edge of the depression so as to form a trough. The ridge serves to support the chip above the cavity. To attach the chip to the package, an adhesive may be deposited in the trough. This configuration promotes efficient use of chip surface area, thus increasing the number of chips yielded from a wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Top casing <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> includes alignment holes <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, holes <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> are different in size to ensure correct orientation of the package when mounted on an alignment table. Alternatively, the holes may have different shapes to achieve this objective. Optionally, the holes taper radially inward from surface <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> toward <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to reduce the friction against alignment pins while still maintaining adequate contact to prevent slippage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, channels <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> are optionally formed on internal surface <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Channels <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight> communicate with inlets <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> respectively. A depression <highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight> is formed below cavity. According to some embodiments, the shape of depression <highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight> is symmetrical to the cavity with exception to corners <highlight><bold>595</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>596</bold></highlight>, which accommodate the inlets. The depth of depression <highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight> may be, for example, about 0.7&Prime;. As a result, the bottom wall of the cavity is about 0.05&Prime; thick. Depression <highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight> may receive a temperature controller to monitor and maintain the cavity at the desired temperature. By separating the temperature controller and cavity with a minimum amount of material, the temperature within the cavity may be controlled more efficiently and accurately. Alternatively, channels may be formed on surface <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> for circulating air or water to control the temperature within the cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, certain portions <highlight><bold>595</bold></highlight> of internal surface <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> may be eliminated or cored without interfering with the structural integrity of the package when assembled. Coring the casing reduces the wall thickness, causing less heat to be retained during the injection molding process; potential shrinkage or warpage of the casing is significantly reduced. Also, coring decreases the time required to cool the casing during the manufacturing process. Thus, manufacturing efficiency is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the top casing and bottom casing are mated together using a technique known as acoustic or ultrasonic welding. Accordingly, &ldquo;energy directors&rdquo; <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> are provided. Energy directors are raised ridges or points, preferably v-shaped, that are used in an acoustic welding process. The energy directors are strategically located, for example, to seal the channels without interfering with other features of the package and to provide an adequate bond between the two casings. Alternatively, the casings may be mated together by screws, glue, clips, or other mating techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shows a cross sectional view of the cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> with chip <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> mounted thereon in detail. As shown, a depression <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is formed around cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The depression includes a ridge <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> which supports chip <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The ridge and the depression create a trough around cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the trough is sufficiently large to receive an adhesive <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> for attaching the chip to the package. In one embodiment, the trough is about 0.08&Prime; wide and 0.06&Prime; deep. When mounted, the edge of the chip protrudes slightly beyond ridge <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, but without contacting side <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> of the depression. This configuration permits the adhesive to be dispensed onto the trough and provides adequate surface area for the adhesive to attach chip <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> According to some embodiments, the back surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of chip <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is at least flush or below the plane formed by surface <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of casing <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. As a result, chip <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is shielded by surface <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> from potential damage. This configuration also allows the packages to be easily stored with minimal storage area since the surfaces are substantially flat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the bottom of the cavity includes a light absorptive material, such as a glass filter or carbon dye, to prevent impinging light from being scattered or reflected during imaging by detection systems. This feature improves the signal-to-noise ratio of such systems by significantly reducing the potential imaging of undesired reflected light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the internal surface of bottom casing <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> in greater detail. As shown, the bottom casing <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is substantially planar and contains an opening <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> therein. Preferably, the casing <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is slightly wider or slightly longer than the top casing. In one embodiment, casing <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is about 1.6&Prime; wide, 2.0&Prime; long, and 0.1&Prime; deep, which creates a non-flush edge on the finish assembly. As previously mentioned, this design ensures that the package is correctly oriented when mounted onto the detection systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, opening <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> is spatially located at about the depression below the cavity. The opening also has substantially the same geometric configuration as the depression to allow the temperature controller to contact as much of the bottom of the cavity as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Internal surface <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> of casing <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> includes depressions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. A port <highlight><bold>731</bold></highlight> is located in depression <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> and a port <highlight><bold>741</bold></highlight> is located in depression <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. Ports <highlight><bold>731</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>741</bold></highlight> communicate with channels on the top casing (<highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>) when the package is assembled. A seal <highlight><bold>790</bold></highlight>, which may be a septum composed of rubber, teflon/rubber laminate, or other sealing material is provided for each depression. The septum may be of the type commonly used to seal and reseal vessels when a needle is inserted into the septum for addition/removal of fluids. The septums, when seated in the depressions, extend slightly above surface, which in some embodiments is about 0.01&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> This design causes casings <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to exert pressure on the septum, forming a seal between the ports and the channels. The seal is maintained even after fluid is injected into the cavity since the pressure immediately forces the septum to reseal itself after the needle or other fluid injecting means is removed from the port. Thus, an efficient and economical seal for retaining fluid in the cavity is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Also, casing <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> includes the complementary half alignment holes <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, each tapering radially inward from the external surface. Further, certain areas <highlight><bold>765</bold></highlight> on internal surface <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> may be cored, as similar to the internal surface of the top casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is a simplified illustration of an alternative embodiment of a chip packaging device <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The chip packaging device includes a plurality of casings <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight>. The casings may be defined as a top casing <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight>, a middle casing <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight>, and a bottom casing <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight>. The casings are made of known plastic materials such as ABS plastic, polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, products sold under the trademarks TEFLON&trade; and KALREZ&trade; and the like, among others. Preferably, the casings can be made by way of injection molding and the like. Assembling the chip packaging device from three casings simplifies construction for the fabrication of internal channels and the like, and can also be made at a relatively low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Support structures (or alignment holes) exist at selected locations of the chip packing device. The support structures can be used to mount or position the chip packaging device to an apparatus, e.g., scanner or the like. In an embodiment, the top casing <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight> includes support structures <highlight><bold>3201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3203</bold></highlight> on each side of a center opening <highlight><bold>3209</bold></highlight>. The middle casing <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight> includes similar support structures <highlight><bold>3313</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3315</bold></highlight> which are complementary to the support structures <highlight><bold>3201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3203</bold></highlight>, respectively, in the top casing. The bottom casing also includes similar support structures <highlight><bold>3403</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3401</bold></highlight>, respectively, which are complementary to the support structures in the top casing and the middle casing. As shown, each of the support structures on each side of the center opening align with each other. Each support structure is, for example, an aperture through the casing. The aperture includes an outer periphery defined by a geometrical shape which may be round, rectangular, trapezoidal, hexagonal, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The present chip packaging device assembles with use of complementary alignment pins and bores on the casings. By way of alignment pins (not shown), the top casing aligns with and inserts into alignment bores <highlight><bold>3301</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3303</bold></highlight> in the middle casing <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the middle casing can have alignment pins or the like and the top casing has the alignment bores or the like. The bottom casing includes alignment pins <highlight><bold>3407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3409</bold></highlight> which align to and insert into alignment bores (not shown) in bottom portions of the middle casing. The use of alignment bores and pins provide for ease in assembly of the chip carrier. Upon assembly, the alignment bores and pins on the casings prevent the casings from moving laterally relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> A center opening <highlight><bold>3209</bold></highlight> in the top casing overlies a center portion <highlight><bold>3317</bold></highlight> of the middle casing <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight>. The center portion <highlight><bold>3317</bold></highlight> of the middle casing includes an inner annular region (or cavity edges) with a bottom portion which is preferably a flat bottom portion. The flat bottom portion of the middle casing and portions of the bottom casing including edges define a cavity <highlight><bold>3405</bold></highlight>. A chip is placed overlying an underlying portion of the cavity <highlight><bold>3407</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Optionally, a temperature control mechanism such as a heater, a cooler, or a combination thereof is disposed into the center opening against the bottom portion of the middle casing. The temperature control mechanism can be any suitable thermally controlled element such as a resistive element, a temperature controlled block or mass, thermoelectric modules, or the like. The temperature control mechanism transfers heat via conduction to the bottom center portion, which transfers heat to, for example, fluid in the cavity or the chip. Alternatively, the temperature control mechanism sinks heat away from, for example, fluid in the cavity or the chip through the bottom center portion. The temperature control mechanism maintains a selected temperature in the cavity. The temperature control mechanism also includes a temperature detection device such as a thermocouple which provides signals corresponding to temperature readings. A controller receives the signals corresponding to the temperature readings, and adjusts power output to the temperature control mechanism to maintain the selected temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The top casing <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight> also includes channels <highlight><bold>3205</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3207</bold></highlight> for fluid transfer. The channels <highlight><bold>3205</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3207</bold></highlight> communicate with annular regions <highlight><bold>3309</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight>, respectively, on the middle casing <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight> for fluid transfer. A septum, a plug, an o-ring, a gasket, or the like via annular regions <highlight><bold>3309</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight> seals fluids within the top casing channels <highlight><bold>3205</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3207</bold></highlight> and the middle casing. The bottom casing includes channels <highlight><bold>3411</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3413</bold></highlight> in communication with channels <highlight><bold>3307</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3305</bold></highlight>, respectively. A septum, a plug, an o-ring, a gasket, or the like seals the fluids within the bottom casing channels <highlight><bold>3411</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3413</bold></highlight> and the middle casing channels <highlight><bold>3305</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3307</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The chip packaging device provides an even distribution of fluid (or fluid flow) through the cavity over a top surface (or inner or active surface) of the chip. For example, a selected fluid enters channel <highlight><bold>3207</bold></highlight>, flows through channel <highlight><bold>3307</bold></highlight>, changes direction and flows through channel <highlight><bold>3411</bold></highlight>, and evenly distributes into the cavity <highlight><bold>3405</bold></highlight> over the top surface of the chip. As previously noted, the cavity is defined by the flat bottom portion and cavity edges. A selected fluid exits the cavity by way of channel <highlight><bold>3413</bold></highlight>, channel <highlight><bold>3305</bold></highlight>, and channel <highlight><bold>3205</bold></highlight>. The fluid flow over the top surface of the chip is preferably laminar, but may also be turbulent, a combination thereof or the like. By way of the present chip packaging device, a substantial portion of turbulent flow remains at an upper portion of the channel <highlight><bold>3411</bold></highlight>, and does not enter the cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a selected fluid enters the cavity by way of channel <highlight><bold>3205</bold></highlight>, channel <highlight><bold>3305</bold></highlight>, and channel <highlight><bold>3413</bold></highlight>. The selected fluid exits the cavity through channel <highlight><bold>3411</bold></highlight>, channel <highlight><bold>3307</bold></highlight>, and channel <highlight><bold>3207</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the fluid flows against the direction of gravity through the cavity. Of course, other fluid flow routes may also be employed depending upon the particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> illustrates an assembled chip packaging device <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. As shown are a top-view <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight>, a side-view <highlight><bold>3500</bold></highlight>, a bottom-view <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight>, and a front-view <highlight><bold>3600</bold></highlight> of the assembled chip packaging device <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight>. The assembled chip packaging device <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> includes the bottom casing <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight>, the middle casing <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight>, and the top casing <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The top-view <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight> of the top casing includes alignment structures <highlight><bold>3205</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3215</bold></highlight> surrounding opening <highlight><bold>3209</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>3209</bold></highlight> includes a bevelled annular region <highlight><bold>3211</bold></highlight> surrounding the periphery of the channel <highlight><bold>3209</bold></highlight>. The alignment bores <highlight><bold>3203</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3201</bold></highlight> also include bevelled annular regions <highlight><bold>3213</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3215</bold></highlight>, respectively. A bevelled annular region <highlight><bold>3217</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3221</bold></highlight> also surrounds each fluid channel <highlight><bold>3205</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3207</bold></highlight> to assist with fluid flow therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The bottom-view <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> of the bottom casing includes alignment structures <highlight><bold>3401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3403</bold></highlight> surrounding the cavity <highlight><bold>3405</bold></highlight>. The cavity includes a flat bottom peripheral portion <highlight><bold>3415</bold></highlight>, a bevelled portion <highlight><bold>3417</bold></highlight> extending from the flat bottom peripheral portion, and a flat upper portion <highlight><bold>3419</bold></highlight> surrounding the bevelled portion. The chip includes an outer periphery which rests against the flat bottom peripheral portion <highlight><bold>3415</bold></highlight>. The bevelled portion aligns the chip onto the flat bottom peripheral portion <highlight><bold>3415</bold></highlight>. Similar to the previous embodiments, the top casing extends outside <highlight><bold>3421</bold></highlight> the middle and bottom casings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The cavity <highlight><bold>3405</bold></highlight> is preferably located at a center of the bottom casing, but may also be at other locations. The cavity may be round, square, rectangular, or any other shape, and orientation. The cavity is preferably smaller than the surface area of the chip to be placed thereon, and has a volume sufficient to perform hybridization and the like. In one embodiment, the cavity includes dimensions such as a length of about 0.6 inch, a width of about 0.6 inch and a depth of about 0.07 inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the bottom casing with selected cavity dimensions may be removed from the middle and top casings, and replaced with another bottom casing with different cavity dimensions. This allows a user to attach a chip having a different size or shape by changing the bottom casing, thereby providing ease in using different chip sizes, shapes, and the like. Of course, the size, shape, and orientation of the cavity will depend upon the particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> illustrate in greater detail the chip packaging device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> illustrates simplified top-view <highlight><bold>3260</bold></highlight> and bottom-view <highlight><bold>3250</bold></highlight> diagrams of the top casing <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight>.

As shown, the reference numerals refer to the same elements as the middle casing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. In addition, the bottom-view of the casing includes a substantially smooth and planar bottom surface <highlight><bold>3361</bold></highlight>. A portion of the bottom surface defines an upper portion of the cavity. But the bottom surface can also be textured, ridged, or the like to create turbulence or a selected fluid flow through the cavity. The bottom surface is preferably a hydrophobic surface which enhances laminar flow through the cavity. Of course, the type of bottom surface depends upon the particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> illustrates simplified top-view <highlight><bold>3460</bold></highlight> and bottom-view <highlight><bold>3450</bold></highlight> diagrams of the bottom casing <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight>. As shown, the reference numerals refer to the same elements as the bottom casing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. In an embodiment, fluid from channel <highlight><bold>3305</bold></highlight> changes direction at an upper portion <highlight><bold>3431</bold></highlight> of the channel and flows to a lower portion <highlight><bold>3433</bold></highlight> of the channel. Fluid evenly distributes from the lower portion <highlight><bold>3433</bold></highlight> via a fluid distribution point <highlight><bold>3435</bold></highlight>. The distributed fluid evenly passes over a slanted edge (or bevelled edge) <highlight><bold>3437</bold></highlight> which drops fluid evenly to a top surface of the chip in the cavity. By way of slanted edge <highlight><bold>3427</bold></highlight> which slopes up to a fluid concentration point <highlight><bold>3425</bold></highlight>, fluid leaves the cavity and enters the channel <highlight><bold>3411</bold></highlight>. In particular, fluid leaves the cavity and enters a lower portion <highlight><bold>3423</bold></highlight> of the channel, flows through the channel, and changes directions at an upper portion <highlight><bold>3421</bold></highlight> of the channel. Each channel includes a length L and a width W. The distribution point and the concentration point are positioned at a distance away from the cavity to substantially prevent turbulence from forming in the cavity, and in particular over the top surface of the chip. The channels are each angled at an angle &THgr; ranging from about 2 degrees to about 90 degrees, but is preferably about 5 degrees to about 45 degrees. The angle enhances an even distribution of laminar flow into the cavity. Of course, the exact angle, channel shape, and dimensions depend upon the particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> illustrates a simplified cross-sectional view of an alternative embodiment <highlight><bold>3600</bold></highlight> of the chip packaging device. The chip packaging device includes the three casings <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> of the previous embodiment, and also includes hollow pins, needles, or the like <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3603</bold></highlight>. Each of the pins transfers a selected fluid to and from the cavity <highlight><bold>3405</bold></highlight>. Preferably, each pin <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> includes an external opening <highlight><bold>3609</bold></highlight>, a tubular region <highlight><bold>3611</bold></highlight>, an inner opening <highlight><bold>3607</bold></highlight>, a pointed tip <highlight><bold>3605</bold></highlight>, and other elements. The pin is made from a suitable material such as a glass, a stainless steel or any other high quality material to transfer fluids to and from the cavity <highlight><bold>3405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, each pin is inserted into its channel region <highlight><bold>3205</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>3207</bold></highlight>. A point on the pin tip pierces through, for example, a septum at an annular region <highlight><bold>3309</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>3311</bold></highlight>. A selected fluid travels through pin <highlight><bold>3603</bold></highlight> (through channel <highlight><bold>3205</bold></highlight> and at least a portion of <highlight><bold>3305</bold></highlight>), enters the upper region of channel <highlight><bold>3413</bold></highlight>, and into the cavity <highlight><bold>3405</bold></highlight>. The selected fluid travels from the cavity, through pin <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight>, and to the external apparatus. Alternatively, the selected fluid enters the cavity via pin <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> and exits the cavity via pin <highlight><bold>3603</bold></highlight>. The selected fluid may also enter the cavity via pin and exit the cavity through the channels without use of a pin. The selected fluid may further enter the cavity through the channels without use of a pin and exit through a pin. Of course, the particular pin used and fluid flow will depend upon the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the even distribution of fluid flow through the cavity prevents &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; from occurring in the cavity. For example, the even distribution of fluid through the cavity by way of the previous embodiment substantially prevents fluid from becoming substantially turbulent at certain locations. This prevents &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; caused by such turbulent fluid. The hot spots are often caused by higher chemical activity or exothermic reactions and the like by way of turbulence in such certain locations. </paragraph>

The platform <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> is substantially planar and includes alignment pins <highlight><bold>851</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>852</bold></highlight>. Alignment pins <highlight><bold>851</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>852</bold></highlight> are used to align both the top and bottom casings during the welding process. In some embodiments, a pad <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight>, which may be composed of silicone rubber or other energy absorbing material, is located on platform <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> to prevent damage to the package during assembly. </paragraph>

At step <highlight><bold>9002</bold></highlight>, the system vibrates the welding horn, which in some embodiments is at 20 KHz. The energy generated by the horn melts the energy directors. Simultaneously, the horn translates downward against the package. At step <highlight><bold>9003</bold></highlight>, the pressure exerted by the horn causes the energy directors to fuse with the bottom casing. At step <highlight><bold>9004</bold></highlight>, the welding process is completed when the horn reaches its weld depth, for example, of about 0.01&Prime;. Of course, the various welding parameters may be varied, according to the composition of the materials used, to achieve optimum results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> c. Chip Attachment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> According to some embodiments, an ultraviolet cured adhesive attaches the chip to the package. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> schematically illustrates an adhesive dispensing system used in attaching the chip. The dispensing system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> includes an attachment table <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> to accommodate the package during the attachment process. A chip alignment table <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> for aligning the chip is located adjacent to attachment table <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. A head unit <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> for dispensing the adhesive is located above tables <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>. The head unit <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> also includes a camera that generates an output to video display <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>. Video display <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>, in some embodiments, includes a cross hair alignment mark <highlight><bold>1071</bold></highlight>. The head unit is mounted on a dual-axis (x-y) frame for positioning during alignment and attachment of the chip. The operation of the dispensing system is controlled by a computer <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, which in some embodiments may be Gateway 486DX operating at 33 MHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates the attachment table in greater detail. The attachment table <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> has a substantially flat platform <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> supported by a plurality of legs <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>. Alignment pins <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>, which secure the package during the attachment process, are located on the surface of platform <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Optionally, a needle <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> is provided. Needle <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> includes a channel <highlight><bold>1121</bold></highlight> and is connected to a vacuum pump. In operation, the needle is inserted into one of the ports of the package in order to generate a vacuum in the cavity. The vacuum pressure secures the chip to the package during the attachment process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows table <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> in greater detail. Table <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> includes a substantially flat platform <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> having a depression <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> for holding a chip. In some embodiments, a port <highlight><bold>1241</bold></highlight> is provided in depression <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>. Port <highlight><bold>1241</bold></highlight> is connected to a vacuum pump which creates a vacuum in the depression for immobilizing the chip therein. Platform <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> is mounted on a combination linear rotary stage <highlight><bold>1246</bold></highlight>, which in some embodiments may be a model 26LR manufactured by DARDAL, and a single axis translation stage <highlight><bold>1245</bold></highlight>, which may be a model CR2226HSE2 manufactured by DARDAL. </paragraph>

As shown, a ledge <highlight><bold>1241</bold></highlight> surrounds the depression <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>. Ledge <highlight><bold>1241</bold></highlight> supports the chip when it is placed above depression <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>. Since the chips are placed over the depression with the probes facing the table, this design protects the probes from being potentially damaged during alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates the head unit <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> in greater detail. As shown, the head unit <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> includes a camera assembly <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> that generates an output to a video display. A light <highlight><bold>1360</bold></highlight> is provided to enable the camera to focus and image an object of interest. The head unit also includes an ultraviolet light <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> for curing the adhesive, a vacuum pickup <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight> for moving chip during the attachment process, and an adhesive dispenser <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In operation, a chip package is placed onto table <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. As previously described, the alignment pins on the table immobilize the package. The user begins the chip attachment process by calibrating the head unit. This may be done by moving the camera above the package and aligning it with a mark on the package, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. For convenience, one of the alignment pins may be used as an alignment mark. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrates a typical image <highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight> generated by the camera during this step. As shown, the head unit is not aligned with pin <highlight><bold>1480</bold></highlight>. To align the head unit, the user translates it in both the x and y direction until pin <highlight><bold>1480</bold></highlight> is located at the intersection <highlight><bold>1477</bold></highlight> of the cross hair on the video display, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Next, the chip is inserted into the depression on the chip alignment table. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is a flow chart indicating the steps for aligning the chip. At step <highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>, the system positions the camera (head unit) above one of the chip&apos;s alignment marks. The camera images the alignment mark on the video display. At this point, the mark is normally misaligned (i.e., the mark is not located at the intersection of the cross hair alignment mark). At step <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>, the user adjusts the chip alignment table in both the x and y direction until the mark is substantially located at the intersection of the cross hair. Since no rotational adjustments were made, the mark may be misaligned angularly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>1430</bold></highlight>, the user instructs the system to move the camera above a second alignment mark, which usually is at an opposite comer of the chip. Again, an image of the alignment mark is displayed. At this stage, the alignment mark is probably misaligned in the x, y, and angular directions. At step <highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight>, the user adjusts the rotational stage, x-stage, and y-stage, if necessary, to align the mark with the cross hair on the video display. In instances where the rotational stage has been rotated, the first alignment mark will become slightly misaligned. To compensate for this shift, the user repeats the alignment process beginning at step <highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight> until both marks are aligned. Of course, image processing techniques may be applied for automated head unit and chip alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is an example of an image displayed by the video screen during step <highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>. As shown, the first alignment mark (lower left comer of the chip) is not aligned with the cross hair marking. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>exemplifies an image of the first alignment mark after adjustments were made by the user. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>illustrates a typical image displayed by video screen during step <highlight><bold>1430</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the second alignment mark (upper right comer of the chip) is misaligned in the x, y, and angular directions. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>illustrates an image of the second mark following initial adjustments by the user at step <highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>illustrates the orientation of the second alignment mark after the chip has been aligned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Once the chip is aligned, the vacuum holding the chip on the attachment table is released. Thereafter, the pickup on the head unit removes the chip from the table and aligns it on the cavity of the package. In some embodiments, the chip is mated to the pickup by a vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the user may check to ensure that the chip is correctly aligned on the cavity by examining the chip&apos;s alignment marks with the camera. If the chip is out of position, the chip is removed and realigned on the alignment table. If the chip is correctly positioned, the system deposits an adhesive by moving the dispenser along the trough surrounding the cavity. In some embodiments, the vacuum is released before depositing the adhesive in the trough. This step is merely precautionary and implemented to ensure that the vacuum does not cause any adhesive to seep into the cavity. Once the adhesive is deposited, the system reexamines the chip to determine if the adhesive had moved the chip out of position. If the chip is still aligned, the head unit locates the ultraviolet light above the adhesive and cures it for a time sufficient to harden the adhesive, which in one embodiment is about 10 seconds. Otherwise, the chip is realigned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Upon completion, the chip package will have a variety of uses. For example, the chip package will be useful in sequencing genetic material by hybridization. In sequencing by hybridization, the chip package is mounted on a hybridization station where it is connected to a fluid delivery system. Such system is connected to the package by inserting needles into the ports and puncturing the septums therein. In this manner, various fluids are introduced into the cavity for contacting the probes during the hybridization process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Usually, hybridization is performed by first exposing the sample with a prehybridization solution. Next, the sample is incubated under binding conditions with a solution containing targets for a suitable binding period. Binding conditions will vary depending on the application and are selected in accordance with the general binding methods known including those referred to in: Maniatis et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>(1989), 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Berger and Kimmel, <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology, Volume </italic></highlight>152, <highlight><italic>Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques </italic></highlight>(1987), Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif.; Young and Davis (1983) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 80: 1194, which are incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the solution may contain about 1 molar of salt and about 1 to 50 nanomolar of targets. Optionally, the fluid delivery system includes an agitator to improve mixing in the cavity, which shortens the incubation period. Finally, the sample is washed with a buffer, which may be 6&times;SSPE buffer, to remove the unbound targets. In some embodiments, the cavity is filled with the buffer after washing the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the package may be aligned on a detection or imaging system, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854 (Pirrung et al.) or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/495,889 (Attorney Docket Number 11509-117), already incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Such detection systems may take advantage of the package&apos;s asymmetry (i.e., non-flush edge) by employing a holder to match the shape of the package specifically. Thus, the package is assured of being properly oriented and aligned for scanning. The imaging systems are capable of qualitatively analyzing the reaction between the probes and targets. Based on this analysis, sequence information of the targets is extracted. </paragraph>

The body includes alignment holes <highlight><bold>1621</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1622</bold></highlight> that are used, for example, in mating the chip to the package. Optionally, a plurality of ridges <highlight><bold>1690</bold></highlight> is located at end <highlight><bold>1660</bold></highlight> of the body. The friction created by ridges <highlight><bold>1690</bold></highlight> allows the package to be handled easily without slippage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The body also includes two substantially parallel edges <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1640</bold></highlight>. As shown, edge <highlight><bold>1640</bold></highlight> is narrowed at end <highlight><bold>1665</bold></highlight> to create an uneven edge <highlight><bold>1645</bold></highlight>. The asymmetrical design of the body facilitates correct orientation when mounted onto detection systems. For example, detection systems may contain a holder, similar to that of an audio cassette tape, in which end <highlight><bold>1665</bold></highlight> is inserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, ports <highlight><bold>1670</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1671</bold></highlight> communicate with cavity <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>.

As shown, a channel <highlight><bold>2250</bold></highlight> surrounds cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. A notch <highlight><bold>2240</bold></highlight> for receiving the chip <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is formed along or near the top of the cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, a gasket or seal <highlight><bold>2270</bold></highlight> is placed at the bottom of the notch to ensure a tight seal when the chip is attached. Once the chip is located at the notch, a V-shaped wedge <highlight><bold>2260</bold></highlight> is inserted into channel <highlight><bold>2250</bold></highlight>. The wedge forces the body to press against chip&apos;s edges and seal <highlight><bold>2260</bold></highlight>, thus mating the chip to the package. This process is known as compression sealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Other techniques such as insert molding, wave soldering, surface diffusion, laser welding, shrink wrap, o-ring seal, surface etching, or heat staking from the top may also be employed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows an alternative embodiment of package that employs check valves to seal the inlets. As shown, depressions <highlight><bold>2305</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2315</bold></highlight> communicate with cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> through inlets <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. Check valves <highlight><bold>2310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2320</bold></highlight>, which in some embodiments may be duck-billed check valves, are seated in depressions <highlight><bold>2305</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2315</bold></highlight>. To introduce a fluid into the cavity, a needle is inserted into the check valve. When the needle is removed, the check valve reseals itself to prevent leakage of the fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> illustrates another package that uses reusable tape for sealing the cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. As shown, a tape <highlight><bold>2400</bold></highlight> is located above inlets <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. Preferably, end <highlight><bold>2430</bold></highlight> of tape is permanently fixed to surface <highlight><bold>2480</bold></highlight> while end <highlight><bold>2410</bold></highlight> remains unattached. The mid section <highlight><bold>2420</bold></highlight> of the tape is comprised of non-permanent adhesive. This design allows inlets to be conveniently sealed or unsealed without completely separating the tape from the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> illustrates yet another embodiment of the package that uses plugs to retain fluids within the cavity.

A chip <highlight><bold>2790</bold></highlight> having an array of probes <highlight><bold>2795</bold></highlight> on surface <highlight><bold>2791</bold></highlight> is mated to the bottom of cavity <highlight><bold>2710</bold></highlight> with an adhesive <highlight><bold>2741</bold></highlight>. The adhesive, for example, may be silicone, adhesive tape, or other adhesive. Alternatively, clips or other mounting techniques may be employed. Optionally, the bottom of the cavity may include a depression in which a chip is seated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> This configuration provides several advantages such as: 1) permitting the use of any type of substrate (i.e., non-transparent or non-translucent), 2) yielding more chips per wafer since the chip does not require an edge for mounting, and 3) allowing chips of various sizes or multiple chips to be mated to the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> A cover <highlight><bold>2770</bold></highlight> is mated to the package for sealing the cavity. Preferably, cover <highlight><bold>2770</bold></highlight> is composed of a transparent or translucent material such as glass, acrylic, or other material that is penetrable by light. Cover <highlight><bold>2270</bold></highlight> may be mated to surface <highlight><bold>2705</bold></highlight> with an adhesive <highlight><bold>2772</bold></highlight>, which in some embodiments may be silicone, adhesive film, or other adhesive. Optionally, a depression may be formed around the cavity such that surface <highlight><bold>2271</bold></highlight> of the cover is at least flush with surface <highlight><bold>2705</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the cover may be mated to surface <highlight><bold>2705</bold></highlight> according to any of the chip attachment techniques described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Inlets <highlight><bold>2750</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2751</bold></highlight> are provided and communicate with cavity <highlight><bold>2710</bold></highlight>. Selected fluids are circulated through the cavity via inlets <highlight><bold>2750</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2751</bold></highlight>. To seal the fluids in the cavity, a septum, plug, or other seal may be employed. In alternative embodiments, any of the fluid retention techniques described herein may be utilized. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the body is configured with a plurality of cavities. The cavities, for example, may be in a 96-well micro-titre format. In some embodiments, a chip is mounted individually to each cavity according to the methods described above. Alternatively, the probe arrays may be formed on the wafer in a format matching that of the cavities. Accordingly, separating the wafer is not necessary before attaching the probe arrays to the package. This format provides significant increased throughput by enabling parallel testing of a plurality of samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> V. Details of an Agitation System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> illustrates an agitation system in detail. As shown, the agitation system <highlight><bold>2800</bold></highlight> includes two liquid containers <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight>, which in the some embodiments are about 10 milliliters each. Container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight> communicates with port <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> via tube <highlight><bold>2850</bold></highlight> and container <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight> communicates with port <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> via tube <highlight><bold>2860</bold></highlight>. An inlet port <highlight><bold>2812</bold></highlight> and a vent port <highlight><bold>2811</bold></highlight> are located at or near the top of container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight>. Container <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight> also includes an inlet port <highlight><bold>2822</bold></highlight> and a vent <highlight><bold>2821</bold></highlight> at or near its top. Port <highlight><bold>2812</bold></highlight> of container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight> and port <highlight><bold>2822</bold></highlight> of container <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight> are both connected to a valve assembly <highlight><bold>2828</bold></highlight> via valves <highlight><bold>2840</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2841</bold></highlight>. An agitator <highlight><bold>2801</bold></highlight>, which may be a nitrogen gas (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or other gas, is connected to valve assembly <highlight><bold>2828</bold></highlight> by fitting <highlight><bold>2851</bold></highlight>. Valves <highlight><bold>2840</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2841</bold></highlight> regulate the flow of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into their respective containers. In some embodiments, additional containers (not shown) may be provided, similar to container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight>, for introducing a buffer and/or other fluid into the cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> In operation, a fluid is placed into container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight>. The fluid, for example, may contain targets that are to be hybridized with probes on the chip. Container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight> is sealed by closing port <highlight><bold>2811</bold></highlight> while container <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight> is vented by opening port <highlight><bold>2821</bold></highlight>. Next, N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is injected into container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight>, forcing the fluid through tube <highlight><bold>2850</bold></highlight>, cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and finally into container <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight>. The bubbles formed by the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>agitate the fluid as it circulates through the system. When the amount of fluid in container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight> nears empty, the system reverses the flow of the fluid by closing valve <highlight><bold>2840</bold></highlight> and port <highlight><bold>2821</bold></highlight> and opening valve <highlight><bold>2841</bold></highlight> and port <highlight><bold>2811</bold></highlight>. This cycle is repeated until the reaction between the probes and targets is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In some applications, foaming may occur when N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>interacts with the fluid. Foaming potentially inhibits the flow of the fluid through the system. To alleviate this problem, a detergent such as CTAB may be added to the fluid. In one embodiment, the amount of CTAB added is about 1 millimolar. Additionally, the CTAB affects the probes and targets positively by increasing the rate at which they bind, thus decreasing the reaction time required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The system described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> may be operated in an alternative manner. According to this technique, back pressure formed in the second container is used to reverse the flow of the solution. In operation, the fluid is placed in container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight> and both ports <highlight><bold>2811</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2821</bold></highlight> are closed. As N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is injected into container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight>, the fluid is forced through tube <highlight><bold>2850</bold></highlight>, cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and finally into container <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight>. Because the vent port in container <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight> is closed, the pressure therein begins to build as the volume of fluid and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>increases. When the amount of fluid in container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight> nears empty, the flow of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight> is terminated by closing valve <highlight><bold>2840</bold></highlight>. Next, the circulatory system is vented by opening port <highlight><bold>2811</bold></highlight> of container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight>. As a result, the pressure in container <highlight><bold>2820</bold></highlight> forces the solution back through the system toward container <highlight><bold>2810</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the system is injected with N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>for about 3 seconds and vented for about 3 seconds. This cycle is repeated until hybridization between the probes and targets is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the agitation system. System <highlight><bold>2900</bold></highlight> includes a vortexer <highlight><bold>2910</bold></highlight> on which the chip package <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is mounted. A container <highlight><bold>2930</bold></highlight> for holding the fluid communicates with inlet <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> via tube <highlight><bold>2950</bold></highlight>. A valve <highlight><bold>2935</bold></highlight> may be provided to control the flow of solution into the cavity. In some embodiments, circulator <highlight><bold>2901</bold></highlight>, which may be a N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>source or other gas source, is connected to container <highlight><bold>2930</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a pump or other fluid transfer device may be employed. The flow of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into container <highlight><bold>2930</bold></highlight> is regulated by a valve <highlight><bold>2936</bold></highlight>. Circulator <highlight><bold>2901</bold></highlight> is also connected to inlet tube <highlight><bold>2950</bold></highlight> via a valve <highlight><bold>2902</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> A waste container <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight> communicates with port <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> via outlet tube <highlight><bold>2955</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, a liquid sensor <highlight><bold>2940</bold></highlight> may be provided for sensing the presence of liquid in outlet tube <highlight><bold>2955</bold></highlight>. Access to the waste container may be controlled by a valve <highlight><bold>2921</bold></highlight>. Optionally, additional containers (not shown), similar to container <highlight><bold>2930</bold></highlight>, may be employed for introducing a buffer or other fluid into the cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The system is initialized by closing all valves and filling container <highlight><bold>2930</bold></highlight> with, for example, a fluid containing targets. Next, valves <highlight><bold>2936</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2935</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2955</bold></highlight> are opened. This allows N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to enter container <highlight><bold>2930</bold></highlight> which forces the fluid to flow through tube <highlight><bold>2950</bold></highlight> and into the cavity. When the cavity is filled, valves <highlight><bold>2935</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2936</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>2955</bold></highlight> are closed to seal the fluid in the cavity. Next, the vortexer is activated to vibrate the chip package, similar to a paint mixer. In some embodiments, the vortexer may vibrate the package at about <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> cycles per minutes. The motion mixes the targets in the fluid, shortening the incubation period. In some embodiments, the vortexer rotates the chip package until hybridization is completed. Upon completion, valve <highlight><bold>2902</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2955</bold></highlight> are opened to allow N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into the cavity. The N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>empties the fluid into waste container <highlight><bold>2920</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the cavity may be filled with a buffer or other fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment in which the agitation system is partially integrated into the chip package. As shown, chip package <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> on which the chip is mounted. Cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is provided with inlets <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The package also includes chambers <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3020</bold></highlight>. A port <highlight><bold>3021</bold></highlight> is provided in chamber <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> and is connected to inlet <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> by a channel <highlight><bold>3025</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Chamber <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> is equipped with ports <highlight><bold>3011</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3012</bold></highlight>. Port <highlight><bold>3012</bold></highlight> communicates with inlet <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> through a channel <highlight><bold>3015</bold></highlight>. Channel <highlight><bold>3015</bold></highlight> is provided with a waste port <highlight><bold>3016</bold></highlight> that communicates with a fluid disposal system <highlight><bold>3500</bold></highlight> via a tube <highlight><bold>3501</bold></highlight>. A valve <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight> regulates the flow of fluids into the disposal system. In some embodiments, the disposal system includes a waste container <highlight><bold>3510</bold></highlight> and fluid recovery container <highlight><bold>3520</bold></highlight> which are connected to tube <highlight><bold>3501</bold></highlight>. A valve <highlight><bold>3530</bold></highlight> is provided to direct the flow of fluids into either the waste container or recovery container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Port <highlight><bold>3011</bold></highlight> is coupled to a fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>3600</bold></highlight> through a tube <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight>. Fluids flowing into chamber <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> from the fluid delivery system are regulated by a valve <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight>. The fluid delivery system includes fluid containers <highlight><bold>3610</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3620</bold></highlight> that are interconnected with a tube <highlight><bold>3690</bold></highlight>. Container <highlight><bold>3610</bold></highlight>, which may hold a fluid containing targets, includes ports <highlight><bold>3616</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3615</bold></highlight>. Port <highlight><bold>3616</bold></highlight> is connected to tube <highlight><bold>3690</bold></highlight>. A valve <highlight><bold>3612</bold></highlight> controls the flow of the fluid out of container <highlight><bold>3610</bold></highlight>. A circulator <highlight><bold>3605</bold></highlight>, which may be a N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>source, is connected to port <highlight><bold>3615</bold></highlight> of container <highlight><bold>3610</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, any type of gas, pump or other fluid transfer device may be employed. The flow of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into container <highlight><bold>3610</bold></highlight> is controlled by a valve <highlight><bold>3618</bold></highlight>. A valve <highlight><bold>3619</bold></highlight> may also be provided to vent container <highlight><bold>3610</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Container <highlight><bold>3620</bold></highlight>, which may hold a buffer, is provided with ports <highlight><bold>3625</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3626</bold></highlight>. Circulator <highlight><bold>3605</bold></highlight> is connected to port <highlight><bold>3625</bold></highlight>. A valve <highlight><bold>3621</bold></highlight> is provided to control the flow of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into container <highlight><bold>3620</bold></highlight>. Port <highlight><bold>3626</bold></highlight> is connected to tube <highlight><bold>3690</bold></highlight> via a valve <highlight><bold>3622</bold></highlight>. Valve <highlight><bold>3622</bold></highlight> regulates the flow of the buffer out of container <highlight><bold>3620</bold></highlight>. Optionally, additional containers (not shown), similar to container <highlight><bold>3620</bold></highlight>, may be configured for introducing other fluids into the cavity. A valve <highlight><bold>3690</bold></highlight> connects circulator <highlight><bold>3605</bold></highlight> to tube <highlight><bold>3690</bold></highlight> for controlling the flow of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>directly into the package. A valve <highlight><bold>3652</bold></highlight> is provided for venting the fluid delivery system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In the initial operating state, all valves are shut. To start the hybridization process, a fluid containing targets is introduced into chamber <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> by opening valves <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3612</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3618</bold></highlight>. This injects N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into container <highlight><bold>3610</bold></highlight> which forces the fluid to flow through <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> and into chamber <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight>. When chamber <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> is filled, valves <highlight><bold>3612</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3618</bold></highlight> are closed. Next, valve <highlight><bold>3642</bold></highlight> is opened, allowing N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to flow directly into chamber <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight>. The N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>agitates and circulates the fluid into cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and out to chamber <highlight><bold>3020</bold></highlight>. As the volume of fluid and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in chamber <highlight><bold>3020</bold></highlight> increase, likewise does the pressure therein. When chamber <highlight><bold>3020</bold></highlight> approaches its capacity, valve <highlight><bold>3642</bold></highlight> is closed to stop the fluid flow. Thereafter, the system is vented by opening valve <highlight><bold>3652</bold></highlight>. Venting the system allows the back pressure in chamber <highlight><bold>3020</bold></highlight> to reverse the flow of fluids back into chamber <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight>. When chamber <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> is filled, valve <highlight><bold>3652</bold></highlight> is closed and valve <highlight><bold>3642</bold></highlight> is opened to reverse the fluid flow. This cycle is repeated until hybridization is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> When hybridization is completed, the system may be drained. This procedure depends on which chamber the fluid is located in. If the fluid is located in chamber <highlight><bold>3020</bold></highlight>, then valve <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight> is opened, while valve <highlight><bold>3530</bold></highlight> is positioned to direct the fluid into the appropriate container (recovery or waste). The pressure in chamber <highlight><bold>3020</bold></highlight> forces the fluid through port <highlight><bold>3016</bold></highlight>, tube <highlight><bold>3501</bold></highlight>, and into the disposal system. If the fluid is in chamber <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight>, then valve <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3642</bold></highlight> are opened. As a result, N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>forces the fluid in chamber <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> through port <highlight><bold>3501</bold></highlight> and into the disposal system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Once the system is emptied, all valves are closed. A buffer or other fluid may be introduced into the cavity. For example, the cavity may be filled with a buffer by opening valves <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3621</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3622</bold></highlight>. This injects N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into container <highlight><bold>3620</bold></highlight> which forces the buffer therein to flow through the system until it fills cavity <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In the alternative, ultrasonic radiation, heat, magnetic beads, or other agitation techniques may be employed. </paragraph>
