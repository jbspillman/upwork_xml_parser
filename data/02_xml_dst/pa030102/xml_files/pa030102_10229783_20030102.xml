<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An advertisement selection system is presented in which vectors describing an actual or hypothetical market for a product or desired viewing audience can be determined. An ad characterization vector is transmitted along with a consumer ID. The consumer ID is used to retrieve a consumer characterization vector which is correlated with the ad characterization vector to determine the suitability of the advertisement to the consumer. The consumer characterization vector describes statistical information regarding the demographics and product purchase preferences of a consumer, and is developed from previous purchases or viewing habits.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The advent of the Internet has resulted in the ability to communicate data across the globe instantaneously, and will allow for numerous new applications which enhance consumer&apos;s lives. One of the enhancements which can occur is the ability for the consumer to receive advertising which is relevant to their lifestyle, rather than a stream of ads determined by the program they are watching. Such &ldquo;targeted ads&rdquo; can potentially reduce the amount of unwanted information which consumers receive in the mail, during television programs, and when using the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> From an advertiser&apos;s perspective the ability to target ads can be beneficial since they have some confidence that their ad will at least be determined relevant by the consumer, and therefore will not be found annoying because it is not applicable to their lifestyle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to determine the applicability of an advertisement to a consumer, it is necessary to know something about their lifestyle, and in particular to understand their demographics (age, household size, income). In some instances it is useful to know their particular purchasing habits. As an example, a vendor of soups would like to know which consumers are buying their competitor&apos;s soup, so that they can target ads at those consumers in an effort to convince them to switch brands. That vendor will probably not want to target loyal customers, although for a new product introduction the strategy may be to convince loyal customers to try the new product. In both cases it is extremely useful for the vendor to be able to determine what brand of product the consumer presently purchases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are several difficulties associated with the collection, processing, and storage of consumer data. First, collecting consumer data and determining the demographic parameters of the consumer can be difficult. Surveys can be performed, and in some instances the consumer will willingly give access to normally private data including family size, age of family members, and household income. In such circumstances there generally needs to be an agreement with the consumer regarding how the data will be used. If the consumer does not provide this data directly, the information must be &ldquo;mined&rdquo; from various pieces of information which are gathered about the consumer, typically from specific purchases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Once data is collected, usually from one source, some type of processing can be performed to determine a particular aspect of the consumer&apos;s life. As an example, processing can be performed on credit data to determine which consumers are a good credit risk and have recently applied for credit. The resulting list of consumers can be solicited, typically by direct mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although information such as credit history is stored on multiple databases, storage of other information such as the specifics of grocery purchases is not typically performed. Even if each individual&apos;s detailed list of grocery purchases was recorded, the information would be of little use since it would amount to nothing more than unprocessed shopping lists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Privacy concerns are also an important factor in using consumer purchase information. Consumers will generally find it desirable that advertisements and other information is matched with their interests, but will not allow indiscriminate access to their demographic profile and purchase records. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The Internet has spawned the concept of &ldquo;negatively priced information&rdquo; in which consumers can be paid to receive advertising. Paying consumers to watch advertisements can be accomplished interactively over the Internet, with the consumer acknowledging that they will watch an advertisement for a particular price. Previously proposed schemes such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,794,210, entitled &ldquo;Attention Brokerage,&rdquo; of which A. Nathaniel Goldhaber and Gary Fitts are the inventors, describe such a system, in which the consumer is presented with a list of advertisements and their corresponding payments. The consumer chooses from the list and is compensated for viewing the advertisement. The system requires real-time interactivity in that the viewer must select the advertisement from the list of choices presented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The ability to place ads to consumers and compensate them for viewing the advertisements opens many possibilities for new models of advertising. However, it is important to understand the demographics and product preferences of the consumer in order to be able to determine if an advertisement is appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Although it is possible to collect statistical information regarding consumers of particular products and compare those profiles against individual demographic data points of consumers, such a methodology only allows for selection of potential consumers based on the demographics of existing customers of the same or similar products. U.S. Pat. No. 5,515,098, entitled &ldquo;System and method for selectively distributing commercial messages over a communications network,&rdquo; of which John B. Carles is the inventor, describes a method in which target household data of actual customers of a product are compared against subscriber household data to determine the applicability of a commercial to a household. It will frequently be desirable to target an advertisement to a market having discretionary characteristics and to obtain a measure of the correlation of these discretionary features with probabilistic or deterministic data of the consumer/subscriber, rather than being forced to rely on the characteristics of existing consumers of a product. Such correlations should be possible based both on demographic characteristics and product preferences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another previously proposed system, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,521, entitled &ldquo;Method and apparatus for providing electronic advertisements to end users in a consumer best-fit pricing manner,&rdquo; of which R. Dedrick is the inventor, utilizes a consumer scale as the mechanism to determine to which group and advertisement is intended. Such a system requires specification of numerous parameters and weighting factors, and requires access to specific and non-statistical personal profile information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for an advertisement selection system which can match an advertisement with discretionary target market characteristics, and which can do so in a manner which protects the privacy of the consumer data and characterizations. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention describes a system for determining the applicability of an advertisement to a consumer, based on the reception of an ad characterization vector and use of a unique consumer ID. The consumer ID is used to retrieve a consumer characterization vector, and the correlation between the consumer characterization vector and the ad characterization vector is used to determine the applicability of the advertisement to the consumer. The price to be paid for presentation of the advertisement can be determined based on the degree of correlation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The price to present an advertisement can increase with correlation, as may be typical when the content/opportunity provider is also the profiling entity. The price can decrease with correlation when the consumer is the profiler, and is interested in, and willing to charge less for seeing advertisements which are highly correlated with their demographics, lifestyle, and product preferences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be used to specify purchasers of a specific product. In a preferred embodiment the advertisement characterization vector contains a description of a target market including an indicator of a target product, i.e., purchasers of a particular product type, brand, or product size. The advertisement characterization vector is correlated with a consumer characterization vector which is retrieved based on a unique consumer ID. The correlation factor is determined and indicates if the consumer is a purchaser of the product the advertisement is intended for. This feature can be used to identify purchasers of a particular brand and can be used to target ads at those consumers to lure them away from their present product provider. Similarly, this feature can be used to target ads to loyal consumers to introduce them to a new product in a product family, or different size of product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> One advantage of the present invention is that discretionary target market parameters can be specified and do not necessarily need to correspond to an existing market, but can reflect the various market segments for which the advertisement is targeted. The market segments can be designated by demographic characteristics or by product preferences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that demographic samples of present purchasers of a product are not required to define the target market. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be used to determine the applicability of an advertisement to a consumer based on demographics, product preferences, or a combination of both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the correlation is calculated as the scalar product of the ad characterization vector and the consumer characterization vector. The ad characterization vector and consumer characterization vector can be composed of demographic characteristics, product purchase characteristics, or a combination of both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment pricing for the displaying of said advertisement is developed based on the result of the correlation between the ad characterization vector and the consumer characterization vector. In a first embodiment the pricing increases as a function of the correlation. This embodiment can represent the situation in which the party which determines the correlation also controls the ability to display the advertisement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment the price for displaying the advertisement decreases as a function of the degree of correlation. This embodiment can represent the situation in which the consumer controls access to the consumer characterization vector, and charges less to view advertisements which are highly correlated with their interests and demographics. A feature of this embodiment is the ability of the consumer to decrease the number of unwanted advertisements by charging a higher price to view advertisements which are likely to be of less interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> One advantage of the present invention is that it allows advertisements to be directed to new markets by setting specific parameters in the ad characterization vector, and does not require specific statistical knowledge regarding existing customers of similar products. Another advantage is that the system allows ads to be directed at consumers of a competing brand, or specific targeting at loyal customers. This feature can be useful for the introduction of a new product to an existing customer base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that the correlation can be performed by calculating a simple scalar (dot) product of the ad characterization and consumer characterization vectors. A weighted sum or other statistical analysis is not required to determine the applicability of the advertisement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be realized as a data processing system and as a computer program. The invention can be realized on an individual computer or can be realized using distributed computers with portions of the system operating on various computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is the ability to direct advertisements to consumers which will find the advertisements of interest. This eliminates unwanted advertisements. Another advantage is the ability of advertisers to target specific groups of potential customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> These and other features and objects of the invention will be more fully understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments which should be read in light of the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In describing a preferred embodiment of the invention illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology will be used for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terms so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific term includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings, in general, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 10</cross-reference> in particular, the method and apparatus of the present invention is disclosed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows a user relationship diagram which illustrates the relationships between a consumer profiling system and various entities. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can receive information and advertisements from a consumer personal computer (PC) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, displayed on a television <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which is connected to a set top <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, or can receive a mailed ad <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Advertisements and information displayed on consumer PC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or television <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be received over an Internet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, or can be received over the combination of the Internet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with another telecommunications access system. The telecommunications access system can include but is not limited to cable TV delivery systems, switched digital video access systems operating over telephone wires, microwave telecommunications systems, or any other medium which provides connectivity between the consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a content server <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and ad server <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> maintains the content server <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> which can transmit content including broadcast programming across a network such as the Internet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Other methods of data transport can be used including private data networks and can connect the content sever <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> through an access system to a device owned by consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is termed such since if consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is receiving a transmission from content server <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, the content/opportunity provider can insert an advertisement. For video programming, content/opportunity provider is typically the cable network operator or the source of entertainment material, and the opportunity is the ability to transmit an advertisement during a commercial break. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The majority of content that is being transmitted today is done so in broadcast form, such as broadcast television programming (broadcast over the air and via cable TV networks), broadcast radio, and newspapers. Although the interconnectivity provided by the Internet will allow consumer specific programming to be transmitted, there will still be a large amount of broadcast material which can be sponsored in part by advertising. The ability to insert an advertisement in a broadcast stream (video, audio, or mailed) is an opportunity for advertiser <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Content can also be broadcast over the Internet and combined with existing video services, in which case opportunities for the insertion of advertisements will be present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> represents content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and content server <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> as being independently connected to Internet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, with the consumer&apos;s devices also being directly connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can also control access to the subscriber. This can occur when the content/opportunity provider is also the cable operator or telephone company. In such instances, the cable operator or telephone company can be providing content to consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> over the cable operator/telephone company access network. As an example, if the cable operator has control over the content being transmitted to the consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and has programmed times for the insertion of advertisements, the cable operator is considered to be a content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> since the cable operator can provide advertisers the opportunity to access consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by inserting an advertisement at the commercial break. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a pricing policy can be defined. The content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can charge advertiser <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> for access to consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> during an opportunity. In a preferred embodiment the price charged for access to consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by content/opportunity provider varies as a function of the applicability of the advertisement to consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In an alternate embodiment consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> retains control of access to the profile and charges for viewing an advertisement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The content provider can also be a mailing company or printer which is preparing printed information for consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As an example, content server <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> can be connected to a printer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> which creates a mailed ad <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> for consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, printer <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> can produce advertisements for insertion into newspapers which are delivered to consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Other printed material can be generated by printer <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and delivered to consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a variety of ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Advertiser <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> maintains an ad server <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> which contains a variety of advertisements in the form of still video which can be printed, video advertisements, audio advertisements, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Profiler <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> maintains a consumer profile server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which contains the characterization of consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The consumer profiling system is operated by profiler <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, who can use consumer profile server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or another computing device connected to consumer profile server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to profile consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Data to perform the consumer profiling is received from a point of purchase <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Point of purchase <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be a grocery store, department store, other retail outlet, or can be a web site or other location where a purchase request is received and processed. In a preferred embodiment, data from the point of purchase is transferred over a public or private network <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, such as a local area network within a store or a wide area network which connects a number of department or grocery stores. In an alternate embodiment the data from point of purchase <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is transmitted over the Internet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to profiler <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Profiler <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be a retailer who collects data from its stores, but can also be a third party who contracts with consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the retailer to receive point of purchase data and to profile the consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may agree to such an arrangement based on the increased convenience offered by targeted ads, or through a compensation arrangement in which they are paid on a periodic basis for revealing their specific purchase records. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Consumer profile server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can contain a consumer profile which is determined from observation of the consumer&apos;s viewing habits on television <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> or consumer PC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A method and apparatus for determining demographic and product preference information based on the consumer&apos;s use of services such as cable television and Internet access is described in the co-pending application entitled &ldquo;Subscriber characterization system,&rdquo; filed on Dec. 3, 1998, with Ser. No. 09/204,888 and in the co-pending application entitled &ldquo;Client-server based subscriber characterization system,&rdquo; filed on Dec. 3, 1998, with Ser. No. 09/205,653, both of which are incorporated herein by reference but which are not admitted to be prior art. When used herein, the term consumer characterization vector also represents the subscriber characterization vector described in the aforementioned applications. Both the consumer characterization vector and the subscriber characterization vector contain demographic and product preference information which is related to consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates an alternate embodiment of the present invention in which the consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is also profiler <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> maintains consumer profile server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which is connected to a network, either directly or through consumer PC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or set top <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Consumer profile server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can contain the consumer profiling system, or the profiling can be performed in conjunction with consumer PC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or set top <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. A subscriber characterization system which monitors the viewing habits of consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be used in conjunction with the consumer profiling system to create a more accurate consumer profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> When the consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is also the profiler <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, access to the consumer demographic and product preference characterization is controlled exclusively by consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, who will grant access to the profile in return for receiving an increased accuracy of ads, for cash compensation, or in return for discounts or coupons on goods and services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> illustrates an example of a probabilistic demographic characterization vector. The demographic characterization vector is a representation of the probability that a consumer falls within a certain demographic category such as an age group, gender, household size, or income range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the demographic characterization vector includes interest categories. The interest categories may be organized according to broad areas such as music, travel, and restaurants. Examples of music interest categories include country music, rock, classical, and folk. Examples of travel categories include &ldquo;travels to another state more than twice a year,&rdquo; and travels by plane more than twice a year.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> illustrates a deterministic demographic characterization vector. The deterministic demographic characterization vector is a representation of the consumer profile as determined from deterministic rather than probabilistic data. As an example, if consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> agrees to answer specific questions regarding age, gender, household size, income, and interests the data contained in the consumer characterization vector will be deterministic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As with probabilistic demographic characterization vectors, the deterministic demographic characterization vector can include interest categories. In a preferred embodiment, consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> answers specific questions in a survey generated by profiler <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and administered over the phone, in written form, or via the Internet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and consumer PC <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The survey questions correspond either directly to the elements in the probabilistic demographic characterization vector, or can be processed to obtain the deterministic results for storage in the demographic characterization vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> illustrates a product preference vector. The product preference represents the average of the consumer preferences over past purchases. As an example, a consumer who buys the breakfast cereal manufactured by Post under the trademark ALPHABITS about twice as often as purchasing the breakfast cereal manufactured by Kellogg under the trademark CORN FLAKES, but who never purchases breakfast cereal manufactured by General Mills under the trademark WHEATIES, would have a product preference characterization such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the preferred size of the consumer purchase of a particular product type can also be represented in the product preference vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> represents a data structure for storing the consumer profile, which can be comprised of a consumer ID field <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight>, a deterministic demographic data field <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight>, a probabilistic demographic data field <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, and one or more product preference data fields <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>D, the product preference data field <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> can be comprised of multiple fields arranged by product categories <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Depending on the data structure used to store the information contained in the vector, any of the previously mentioned vectors may be in the form of a table, record, linked tables in a relational database, series of records, or a software object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The consumer ID <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> can be any identification value uniquely associated with consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment consumer ID <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is a telephone number, while in an alternate embodiment consumer ID <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is a credit card number. Other unique identifiers include consumer name with middle initial or a unique alphanumeric sequence, the consumer address, social security number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The vectors described and represented in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-C form consumer characterization vectors that can be of varying length and dimension, and portions of the characterization vector can be used individually. Vectors can also be concatenated or summed to produce longer vectors which provide a more detailed profile of consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A matrix representation of the vectors can be used, in which specific elements, such a product categories <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, are indexed. Hierarchical structures can be employed to organize the vectors and to allow hierarchical search algorithms to be used to locate specific portions of vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> represent an ad demographics vector and an ad product preference vector respectively. The ad demographics vector, similar in structure to the demographic characterization vector, is used to target the ad by setting the demographic parameters in the ad demographics vector to correspond to the targeted demographic group. As an example, if an advertisement is developed for a market which is the 18-24 and 24-32 age brackets, no gender bias, with a typical household size of 2-5, and income typically in the range of $20,000-$50,000, the ad demographics vector would resemble the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. The ad demographics vector represents a statistical estimate of who the ad is intended for, based on the advertisers belief that the ad will be beneficial to the manufacturer when viewed by individuals in those groups. The benefit will typically be in the form of increased sales of a product or increased brand recognition. As an example, an &ldquo;image ad&rdquo; which simply shows an artistic composition but which does not directly sell a product may be very effective for young people, but may be annoying to older individuals. The ad demographics vector can be used to establish the criteria which will direct the ad to the demographic group of 18-24 year olds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> illustrates an ad product preference vector. The ad product preference vector is used to select consumers which have a particular product preference. In the example illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the ad product preference vector is set so that the ad can be directed at purchasers of ALPHABITS and WHEATIES, but not at purchasers of CORN FLAKES. This particular setting would be useful when the advertiser represents Kellogg and is charged with increasing sales of CORN FLAKES. By targeting present purchasers of ALPHABITS and WHEATIES, the advertiser can attempt to sway those purchasers over to the Kellogg brand and in particular convince them to purchase CORN FLAKES. Given that there will be a payment required to present the advertisement, in the form of a payment to the content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> or to the consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the advertiser <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> desires to target the ad and thereby increase its cost effectiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the event that advertiser <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> wants to reach only the purchasers of Kellogg&apos;s CORN FLAKES, that category would be set at a high value, and in the example shown would be set to 1. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, product size can also be specified. If there is no preference to size category the values can all be set to be equal. In a preferred embodiment the values of each characteristic including brand and size are individually normalized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Because advertisements can be targeted based on a set of demographic and product preference considerations which may not be representative of any particular group of present consumers of the product, the ad characterization vector can be set to identify a number of demographic groups which would normally be considered to be uncorrelated. Because the ad characterization vector can have target profiles which are not representative of actual consumers of the product, the ad characterization vector can be considered to have discretionary elements. When used herein the term discretionary refers to a selection of target market characteristics which need not be representative of an actual existing market or single purchasing segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the consumer characterization vectors shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-C and the ad characterization vectors represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> have a standardized format, in which each demographic characteristic and product preference is identified by an indexed position. In a preferred embodiment the vectors are singly indexed and thus represent coordinates in n-dimensional space, with each dimension representing a demographic or product preference characteristic. In this embodiment a single value represents one probabilistic or deterministic value (e.g. the probability that the consumer is in the 18-24 year old age group, or the weighting of an advertisement to the age group). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment a group of demographic or product characteristics forms an individual vector. As an example, age categories can be considered a vector, with each component of the vector representing the probability that the consumer is in that age group. In this embodiment each vector can be considered to be a basis vector for the description of the consumer or the target ad. The consumer or ad characterization is comprised of a finite set of vectors in a vector space that describes the consumer or advertisement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the block diagram of a computer system for a realization of the consumer profiling system. A system bus <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> transports data amongst the CPU <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the RAM <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, Read Only Memory&mdash;Basic Input Output System (ROM-BIOS) <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and other components. The CPU <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> accesses a hard drive <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> through a disk controller <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The standard input/output devices are connected to the system bus <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> through the I/O controller <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. A keyboard is attached to the I/O controller <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through a keyboard port <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> and the monitor is connected through a monitor port <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. The serial port device uses a serial port <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to communicate with the I/O controller <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) expansion slots <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) expansion slots <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> allow additional cards to be placed into the computer. In a preferred embodiment, a network card is available to interface a local area, wide area, or other network. The computer system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> can be part of consumer profile server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or can be a processor present in another element of the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a context diagram for the present invention. Context diagrams are useful in illustrating the relationship between a system and external entities. Context diagrams can be especially useful in developing object oriented implementations of a system, although use of a context diagram does not limit implementation of the present invention to any particular programming language. The present invention can be realized in a variety of programming languages including but not limited to C, C&plus;&plus;, Smalltalk, Java, Perl, and can be developed as part of a relational database. Other languages and data structures can be utilized to realize the present invention and are known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in a preferred embodiment consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is resident on consumer profile server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Point of purchase records <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> are transmitted from point of purchase <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and stored on consumer profile server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Heuristic rules <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, pricing policy <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>, and consumer profile <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> are similarly stored on consumer profile server <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment advertisement records <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> are stored on ad server <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and connectivity between advertisement records <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> and consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is via the Internet or other network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment the entities represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are located on servers which are interconnected via the Internet or other network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> receives purchase information from a point of purchase, as represented by point of purchase records <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The information contained within the point of purchase records <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> includes a consumer ID <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, a product ID <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> of the purchased product, the quantity <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> purchased and the price <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> of the product. In a preferred embodiment, the date and time of purchase <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> are transmitted by point of purchase records <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can access the consumer profile <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> to update the profiles contained in it. Consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> retrieves a consumer characterization vector <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> and a product preference vector <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>. Subsequent to retrieval one or more data processing algorithms are applied to update the vectors. An algorithm for updating is illustrated in the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. The updated vectors termed herein as new demographic characterization vector <highlight><bold>566</bold></highlight> and new product preference <highlight><bold>568</bold></highlight> are returned to consumer profile <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> for storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can determine probabilistic consumer demographic characteristics based on product purchases by applying heuristic rules <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight>. Consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> provides a product ID <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> to heuristic rules records <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and receives heuristic rules associated with that product. Examples of heuristic rules are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can determine the applicability of an advertisement to the consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For determination of the applicability of an advertisement, a correlation request <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight> is received by consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> from advertisements records <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, along with consumer ID <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. Advertisements records <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> also provide advertisement characteristics including an ad demographic vector <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight>, an ad product category <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> and an ad product preference vector <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Application of a correlation process, as will be described in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, results in a demographic correlation <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> and a product correlation <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight> which can be returned to advertisement records <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, advertiser <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> uses product correlation <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight> and demographic correlation <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> to determine the applicability of the advertisement and to determine if it is worth purchasing the opportunity. In a preferred embodiment, pricing policy <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> is utilized to determine an ad price <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> which can be transmitted from consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to advertisement records <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> for use by advertiser <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Pricing policy <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> is accessed by consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to obtain ad price <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight>. Pricing policy <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> takes into consideration results of the correlation provided by the consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. An example of pricing schemes are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> illustrate pseudocode for the updating process and for a correlation operation respectively. The updating process involves utilizing purchase information in conjunction with heuristic rules to obtain a more accurate representation of consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, stored in the form of a new demographic characterization vector <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> and a new product preference vector <highlight><bold>568</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in the pseudocode in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> the point of purchase data are read and the products purchase are integrated into the updating process. Consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> retrieves a product demographics vector obtained from the set of heuristic rules <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight> and applies the product demographics vector to the demographics characterization vector <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> and the product preference vector <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> from the consumer profile <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The updating process as illustrated by the pseudocode in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> utilizes a weighting factor which determines the importance of that product purchase with respect to all of the products purchased in a particular product category. In a preferred embodiment the weight is computed as the ratio of the total of products with a particular product ID <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> purchased at that time, to the product total purchase, which is the total quantity of the product identified by its product ID <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> purchased by consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> identified by its consumer ID <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, purchased over an extended period of time. In a preferred embodiment the extended period of time is one year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment the product category total purchase is determined from a record containing the number of times that consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has purchased a product identified by a particular product ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment other types of weighting factors, running averages and statistical filtering techniques can be used to use the purchase data to update the demographic characterization vector. The system can also be reset to clear previous demographic characterization vectors and product preference vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The new demographic characterization vector <highlight><bold>566</bold></highlight> is obtained as the weighted sum of the product demographics vector and the demographic characterization vector <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight>. The same procedure is performed to obtain the new product preference vector <highlight><bold>568</bold></highlight>. Before storing those new vectors, a normalization is performed on the new vectors. When used herein the term product characterization information refers to product demographics vectors, product purchase vectors or heuristic rules, all of which can be used in the updating process. The product purchase vector refers to the vector which represents the purchase of an item represented by a product ID. As an example, a product purchase vector for the purchase of Kellogg&apos;s CORN FLAKES in a 32 oz. size has a product purchase vector with a unity value for Kellogg&apos;s CORN FLAKES and in the 32 oz. size. In the updating process the weighted sum of the purchase as represented by the product purchase vector is added to the product preference vector to update the product preference vector, increasing the estimated probability that the consumer will purchase Kellogg&apos;s CORN FLAKES in the 32 oz. size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> the pseudocode for a correlation process is illustrated. Consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, after receiving the product characteristics and the consumer ID <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> from the advertisement records retrieves the consumer demographic characterization vector <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> and its product preference vector <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>. The demographic correlation is the correlation between the demographic characterization vector <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> and the ad demographics vector. The product correlation is the correlation between the ad product preference vector <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> and the product preference vector <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the correlation process involves computing the dot product between vectors. The resulting scalar is the correlation between the two vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the basis vectors which describe aspects of the consumer can be used to calculate the projections of the ad vector on those basis vectors. In this embodiment, the result of the ad correlation can itself be in vector form whose components represent the degree of correlation of the advertisement with each consumer demographic or product preference feature. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> the basis vectors are the age of the consumer <highlight><bold>1021</bold></highlight>, the income of the consumer <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, and the family size of the consumer <highlight><bold>1031</bold></highlight>. The ad characterization vector <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> represents the desired characteristics of the target audience, and can include product preference as well as demographic characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment the degree of orthogonality of the basis vectors will determine the uniqueness of the answer. The projections on the basis vectors form a set of data which represent the corresponding values for the parameter measured in the basis vector. As an example, if household income is one basis vector, the projection of the ad characterization vector on the household income basis vector will return a result indicative of the target household income for that advertisement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Because basis vectors cannot be readily created from some product preference categories (e.g. cereal preferences) an alternate representation to that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> can be utilized in which the product preference vector represents the statistical average of purchases of cereal in increasing size containers. This vector can be interpreted as an average measure of the cereal purchased by the consumer in a given time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The individual measurements of correlation as represented by the correlation vector can be utilized in determining the applicability of the advertisement to the subscriber, or a sum of correlations can be generated to represent the overall applicability of the advertisement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment individual measurements of the correlations, or projections of the ad characteristics vector on the consumer basis vectors, are not made available to protect consumer privacy, and only the absolute sum is reported. In geometric terms this can be interpreted as disclosure of the sum of the lengths of the projections rather than the actual projections themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment the demographic and product preference parameters are grouped to form sets of paired scores in which elements in the consumer characterization vector are paired with corresponding elements of the ad characteristics vector. A correlation coefficient such as the Pearson product-moment correlation can be calculated. Other methods for correlation can be employed and are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> When the consumer characterization vector and the ad characterization vector are not in a standardized format, a transformation can be performed to standardize the order of the demographic and product preferences, or the data can be decomposed into sets of basis vectors which indicate particular attributes such as age, income or family size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates an example of heuristic rules including rules for defining a product demographics vector. From the product characteristics, a probabilistic determination of household demographics can be generated. Similarly, the monthly quantity purchased can be used to estimate household size. The heuristic rules illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> serve as an example of the types of heuristic rules which can be employed to better characterize consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as a result of their purchases. The heuristic rules can include any set of logic tests, statistical estimates, or market studies which provide the basis for better estimating the demographics of consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> based on their purchases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> the flowchart for updating the consumer characterization vectors is depicted. The system receives data from the point of purchase at receive point of purchase information step <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. The system performs a test to determine if a deterministic demographic characterization vector is available at deterministic demographic information available step <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and, if not, proceeds to update the demographic characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, at read purchase ID info step <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>, the product ID <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is read, and at update consumer demographic characterization vector step <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>, an algorithm such as that represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> is applied to obtain a new demographic characterization vector <highlight><bold>566</bold></highlight>, which is stored in the consumer profile <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> at store updated demographic characterization vector step <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The end test step <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> can loop back to the read purchase ID info <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> if all the purchased products are not yet processed for updating, or continue to the branch for updating the product preference vector <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>. In this branch, the purchased product is identified at read purchase ID info step <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. An algorithm, such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> for updating the product preference vector <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>, is applied in update product preference vector step <highlight><bold>870</bold></highlight>. The updated vector is stored in consumer profile <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> at store product preference vector step <highlight><bold>880</bold></highlight>. This process is carried out until all the purchased items are integrated in the updating process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for the correlation process. At step <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> the advertisement characteristics described earlier in accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> along with the consumer ID are received by consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> the demographic correlation <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> is computed and at step <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> the product preference correlation <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight> is computed. An illustrative example of an algorithm for correlation is presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The system returns demographic correlation <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> and product preference correlation <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight> to the advertisement records <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> before exiting the procedure at end step <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates two pricing schemes, one for content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> based pricing <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight>, which shows increasing cost as a function of correlation. In this pricing scheme, the higher the correlation, the more the content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> charges to air the advertisement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> also illustrates consumer based pricing <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>, which allows a consumer to charge less to receive advertisements which are more highly correlated with their demographics and interests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As an example of the industrial applicability of the invention, a consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can purchase items in a grocery store which also acts as a profiler <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> using a consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The purchase record is used by the profiler to update the probabilistic representation of customer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, both in terms of their demographics as well as their product preferences. For each item purchased by consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, product characterization information in the form of a product demographics vector and a product purchase vector is used to update the demographic characterization vector and the product preference vector for consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> A content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may subsequently determine that there is an opportunity to present an advertisement to consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Content/opportunity provider <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can announce this opportunity to advertiser <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> by transmitting the details regarding the opportunity and the consumer ID <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. Advertiser <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> can then query profiler <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by transmitting consumer ID <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> along with advertisement specific information including the correlation request <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight> and ad demographics vector <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight>. The consumer profiling system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> performs a correlation and determines the extent to which the ad target market is correlated with the estimated demographics and product preferences of consumer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Based on this determination advertiser <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> can decide whether to purchase the opportunity or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Although this invention has been illustrated by reference to specific embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made which clearly fall within the scope of the invention. The invention is intended to be protected broadly within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
