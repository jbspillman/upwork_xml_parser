<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to integrated circuit (IC) devices or semiconductor devices. More particularly, the invention pertains to heat spreading apparatus and methods for dissipating heat from integrated circuit devices or semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Integrated circuit semiconductor devices (ICs) or semiconductor devices are devices including small electronic circuits formed on the surface of a wafer of semiconductor material such as silicon. The ICs or semiconductor devices are fabricated in a plurality on the surface or as part of a wafer. The wafer is then subdivided into discrete IC or semiconductor device chips or dice, and then further tested and assembled for customer use through various well-known individual die testing and packaging techniques, including lead frame packaging, Chip-On-Board (COB) packaging, and flip-chip packaging (FCP). Depending upon the size of the IC or semiconductor device and the size of the wafer, a wafer may be divided into a few dice or as many as several hundred or more than one thousand discrete dice. The discrete IC or semiconductor device may be subsequently packaged in a variety of manners using lead frames, substrates, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Higher powered, faster integrated circuits and/or semiconductor devices generate heat which, if not dissipated, may overheat the IC and/or semiconductor device, resulting in its failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Various means for dissipating heat from ICs and semiconductor devices have been used or proposed. Heat transfer through the metallic leadframe or other conducting wire has been enhanced in different ways, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,541,446 of Kierse, U.S. Pat. No. 4,961,107 of Geist et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,465 of Murphy, U.S. Pat. No. 4,264,917 of Ugon, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,857 of Kishita. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,450,283 of Lin et al. discloses a device in which the die surface is left unencapsulated in the packaging step for improved heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Use of an encapsulant composition having enhanced heat conducting properties is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,358,552 of Shinohara et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,507,675 of Fujii et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,852 of Brown et al., and Japanese Patent Application No. <highlight><bold>58-202429 </bold></highlight>of Tanaka. U.S. Pat. No. 5,379,186 of Gold et al. discloses a package comprising inner and outer layers of encapsulant with an intermediate layer of thermally conductive material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A die support member to which the die is adhesively attached has been used as a heat sink in a variety of configurations. Examples of such are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,701,034 of Marrs, U.S. Pat. No. 5,379,187 of Lee et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,594,282 of Otsuki, U.S. Pat. No. 5,596,231 of Combs, U.S. Pat. No. 5,598,034 of Wakefield, U.S. Pat. No. 4,642,671 of Rohsler et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,434,105 of Liou, U.S. Pat. No. 5,488,254 of Nishimura et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,952 of Kovak et al., and U.S. Pat. No. No. 5,489,801 of Blish II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A single plate of metallic material has been applied to the outside of the package as a heat sink. Such is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,635 of Kim et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,173,764 of Higgins III, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,024,570 of Hartmann et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,924 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,554 of Liang, a layer of thermal grease is inserted between the die and a heat sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,144,747 of Eichelberger, U.S. Pat. No. 5,311,060 of Rostoker et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,997 of Ohta et al. show IC devices with separate heat sinks within the encapsulant near a wall thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,914 of Berndlmaier et al. teaches a heat transfer structure comprising a pool of liquid metal adjacent a parylene-covered die in a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Various patents show the use of flat and non-flat metal conductors for reducing power-ground loop inductance and increasing capacitance to reduce noise and increase operational speed. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,214,845 of King et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,559,306 of Mahulikar, U.S. Pat. No. 5,233,220 of Lamson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,203 of Lin, and Japanese Patent Application No. 60-178651 of Uno. None of these documents mentions heat dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The various methods of heat dissipation require, in general, complex structures. Routes for moisture leakage into the package result from heat spreaders/sinks which are partially exposed. A new heat spreader construction is needed for producing an integrated circuit device with high heat removal rates and protection against electronic noise and spikes, all at low cost and minimum time expenditure, and without problems of leakage. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The invention comprises a vertical mount integrated circuit (IC) or semiconductor device with dual heat spreaders. The planar heat spreaders are adhesively attached to the opposed major surfaces of the package encapsulant. One or both of the heat spreaders has one or more through-hole posts projecting outwardly to be inserted into through-holes in a substrate. When inserted, the posts align the exterior leads of the device with corresponding leads on the substrate for accurate bonding therebetween. One or both of the heat spreaders may be connected to a ground bus to act as a ground plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The heat spreaders of the invention provide enhanced heat dissipation, shielding of the integrated circuit(s) of the IC and/or semiconductor device, and mitigation of transient voltage excursions. The invention is particularly applicable to a vertical mount package which is to be bonded by solder reflow to a substrate such as a circuit board.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention is illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference> and described as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The invention comprises an IC or semiconductor device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with dual heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, where the heat spreaders &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; the encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the IC or semiconductor device. Each heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is fixed to one of the major external surfaces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and substantially overcovers the major external surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In a preferred form, the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are joined to the planar major surfaces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with an adhesive material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the adhesive material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a relatively high coefficient of thermal conductivity and comprises a thin layer. It is also preferable that the adhesive material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) intermediate between the CTEs of the encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In another preferred form, the adhesive material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a relatively high degree of elasticity to compensate for differences between heat spreader CTE and encapsulant CTE. An adhesive coated tape formed of e.g. polyimide may be used as adhesive material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to join the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> An exemplary IC or semiconductor device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is depicted in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, being based on an integrated circuit die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which has its reverse side <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> down-bonded to a lead frame paddle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Electrical bond pads <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on one end of the active surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are bonded by conductive wires <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to lead fingers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> whose outer ends comprise exterior leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be connected to conductors on a substrate (not shown in drawing FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Both the active surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the reverse side <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprise generally parallel major surfaces of the die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As will become apparent from the description, the application of heat spreaders in accordance with the invention may be accomplished regardless of the particular IC or semiconductor device configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are thin planar members or plates formed to substantially overcover the package of encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A pair of through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed as part of each heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, spaced along what will be known herein as the lead edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the heat spreader. The lead edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is defined as the heat spreader edge proximate the exterior leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the package. As shown in the figures, the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extend outward from each heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at each end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the lead edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be located at any locations along an edge of the heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> where their insertion into a through-hole <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or other body will accurately position and hold the IC or semiconductor device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in place for joining the exterior leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to other leads, for example, by solder reflow to surface conductive traces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of a substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Alternately, as illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extend downwardly and outwardly from each heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at each end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the lead edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for connection to a suitable substrate (not shown) by adhesive bonding, reflow soldering, etc. In these drawings, the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is exemplified as a circuit board with a thickness <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and with surface conductive traces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on its upper surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, through-holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are positioned relative to the surface conductive traces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so that precise positioning (and maintenance of the position) of the IC device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for lead attachment is readily accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The through-holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are most easily formed by drilling. The hole diameter <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is based on the size of the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, permitting a snug or interference fit therebetween. The minimum cross-sectional dimensions of the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> depend upon the strength of the heat spreader material. Once the IC device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached to the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the presence of the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> adds much stability. If desired, additional stability may be attained by inserting a fast curing adhesive material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> into the through-holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> surrounding the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The adhesive material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be any of a wide variety of organic adhesives, as known in the art. A similar type adhesive material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be used to bond through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, to the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to attach the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, an alternative IC or semiconductor device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is depicted such as in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, being based on an integrated circuit die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which has its reverse side <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> down-bonded to a lead frame paddle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Electrical bond pads <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on one end of the active surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are bonded by conductive wires <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to lead fingers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> whose outer ends comprise exterior leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be connected to conductors on a substrate (not shown in drawing FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Both the active surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the reverse side <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> comprise generally parallel major surfaces of the die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A, the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are thin planar members or plates formed to substantially overcover the package of encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A pair of through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed as part of each heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, spaced along what will be known herein as the lead edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the heat spreader. The lead edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is defined as the heat spreader edge proximate the exterior leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the package. As shown in the figures, the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extend downwardly and outwardly away from each heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at each end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the lead edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be located at any locations along an edge of the heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> where they are available for subsequent mounting on a substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or other body which will accurately position and hold the IC or semiconductor device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in place to a substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or for joining the external leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to other leads, for example, by solder reflow to surface traces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of a substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In these drawings, the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is exemplified as a circuit board which may include surface conductive traces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> on its upper surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>00391</bold></highlight> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be made of a length <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> such that the post ends <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extend completely along a desired length of the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 7A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be of any cross-sectional shape or thickness suitable for use on the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Typically, the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are formed to have a square or near-square cross-section having a maximum dimension approximately equal to the thickness <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the exterior leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are shown bonded by reflow of solder <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to surface traces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the upper surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A, a</cross-reference> lower portion of a through-hole post <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is bonded to a lead or circuit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while the other through-hole post <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is adhesively secured to the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. If desired, both through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be reflow soldered to circuits <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> on substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or both adhesively bonded to the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are shown with semicircular cutouts <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which together comprise means for precisely registering the spreaders on the encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. They are shown on each heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as semicircular cutouts aligned with cutouts <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The cutouts <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> permit the use of automated machinery for heat spreader placement. The particular registration means may vary, depending upon the particular manipulation apparatus which is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, another form of the invention is shown as having a pair of heat spreaders. A first heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C is formed with no through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, while a second heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D has two end-positioned through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, the completed IC device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has two through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, one at each end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the lead edge <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Only two through-holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are needed to accurately position the IC device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thereon for lead attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A further form of the IC device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</cross-reference>, where each heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B has one through-hole post <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>B, respectively. The two heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B are in fact identical, but are in an inverse position relative to each other. Like the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, only two through-holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A are required in the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to mount the IC device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the exterior leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are shown bonded by reflow of solder <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to surface traces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the upper surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, one of the heat spreaders, i.e. <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B, is configured as a ground plane by e.g. connecting it to a ground lead <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> with a conductor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with solder connections <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the exterior leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are shown bonded by reflow of solder <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to surface traces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the upper surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B are shown bonded by reflow of solder to leads or circuit traces <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> on substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the use of the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B as ground planes when the leads or circuits <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are grounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In each of the embodiments, the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be formed of various materials including a metal such as aluminum or a copper alloy, a metal filled polymer having enhanced heat conductivity, or a ceramic, for example. The preferred material is a metal because of its resistance to breakage and high heat conductivity. Thus, the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may have smaller dimensions and the through-holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may have a smaller diameter. The thickness <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be any suitable thickness for use as a heat spreader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> If desired, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be encapsulated a second time, following bonding of the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the initial encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the second layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of encapsulant will enclose a major portion of each heat spreader <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, whereby only the exterior leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> project from the encapsulant. The second layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of encapsulant may be the same as, or different from, the encapsulation material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the first encapsulation step. This second encapsulation step may comprise injection in a mold, for example, or simply overlaying an encapsulant on the surface, since there are no interior spaces into which encapsulant must be injected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the IC device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as described are many. First, the dissipation rate of thermal energy is very high. The heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provide a high degree of protection of the IC device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during reflow connection of the exterior leads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to a substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Second, precise positioning of the IC device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for attachment to a substrate is made easier and consistent by use of the through-hole posts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Two or less through-holes <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be used to provide accurate bonding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Third, the post-bond stability of the IC device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is increased, lessening the possibility of damage to the device. The stability may be further enhanced by simple application of an adhesive, reflow solder, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Fourth, the heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be easily connected to a ground bus to provide a ground plane or planes for the device. The effects of transient voltage excursions are reduced or eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Fifth, shielding of the device by metal heat spreaders <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also provides protection from lead inductance effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The heat spreaders are easily formed and easily applied to the device, using readily available materials. Their use does not introduce leakage paths by which destructive moisture and gases may penetrate the interior of the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily be recognized by those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details, and representative devices, shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept and embodiments as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
