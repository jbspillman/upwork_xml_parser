<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to semiconductor devices. More particularly, the invention pertains to apparatus for suppressing undesirable high frequency induction noise in high speed integrated circuits (ICs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Modern semiconductor devices including integrated circuit (IC) devices, such as DRAM and SRAM devices have electrically conductive internal leads and output drivers which are switched ON and OFF. The switching operations between no current and peak current is very rapid and may cause rapid changes in the power supply voltage and spikes within the lead circuits and the die circuits. Such induced voltage and current variations cause malfunctions of the integrated circuit and may severely limit the clock speed at which the device may be satisfactorily operated. The problem is particularly relevant in devices having a large number of leads, where many leads may be simultaneously switched ON to cause a large, sudden current drain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The goal of decoupling capacitors is to provide a system whereby the actual ranges of voltage and current in each part of the circuit during the ON and OFF stages are relatively narrow, i.e. positive and negative spikes are avoided, even at high frequency operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A typical semiconductor device comprises a semiconductor die, leads for connecting the die circuit to a host apparatus, and packaging for enclosing and sealing the device. The leads are generally formed as part of a lead frame constructed from a metal foil or as a metal film on a polymeric base such as in tape automated bonding (TAB). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a typical conventional device configuration, a conductive lead frame includes a &ldquo;paddle&rdquo;, &ldquo;island&rdquo;, or &ldquo;die mounting pad&rdquo; upon which the die is mounted. In addition, inner leads are configured to approach the die edges having electrically conductive connection (bond) pads. The bond pads are input/output (I/O) electrodes of the die circuitry which enable connection through inner and outer leads to electronic apparatus. The inner leads and bond pads are normally connected by fine gold wires to provide power supply, ground and various signal connections. The die, connecting wires, and inner leads are then encapsulated to form a package which has outer leads which can be connected to an electrical apparatus such as a circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a typical leads-over-chip (LOC) configuration, the die is mounted to the lead frame leads. Some or all of the lead frame leads overlie portions of the die and are connected to bond pads which may be centrally located or positioned near the periphery of the active die surface. A layer of insulative material such as adhesive tape is typically used to electrically insulate the overlying leads from the active die surface. Alternately, a multi-layer lead frame or a lead frame plus an additional mounting substrate may be used to provide the die support, as well as the inner leads to be mounted atop the die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Regardless of the particular configuration of the wire-bonded device, the length-to-width ratio of the fine wires and inner leads is relatively high, and the wires and leads function as inductors to cause interference and cross-talk. Other factors which increase inductive interference include denser packing of leads and operation at higher clock speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Various solutions for overcoming this deficiency in semiconductor construction have been proffered and typically include the addition of decoupling capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One approach has been to install separate decoupling capacitors on a circuit board and wire them across the power supply and return connections to the semiconductor device. In such designs, the relatively long distance between capacitors and the semiconductor die reduces the effectiveness of the capacitors, and may even increase the deleterious inductance. Exemplary decoupling capacitors for external connection to a packaged device are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,155,656 to Narashimhan et al., for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Various attempts have been made to more effectively decouple inductance by positioning the capacitor(s) more closely to the die. For example, an early method is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,460,010 to Domenico et al., in which the inactive side of the chip is subjected to multiple diffusion steps, and a capacitative layer is formed on and in the die. Other patents showing a capacitor within a die structure include U.S. Pat. No. 3,538,397 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,772,097 to Davis, U.S. Pat. No. 3,769,105 to Chen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,830 to Patel et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,777,518 to Mihara et al. and Japanese Patent Application No. 61&lsqb;1986&rsqb;-73367. The manufacturing processes shown in these references are expensive and complex, requiring a significant number of extra production steps. In addition, their effectiveness in actual use is somewhat less than desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other methods for locating a capacitor close to the semiconductor die have been tried. For example, a separate capacitance structure has been attached to either of the &ldquo;active&rdquo; die surface, the mounting surface of the die, a substrate, or to the lead frame. Exemplary of such designs are U.S. Pat. No. 4,410,905 to Grabbe, U.S. Pat. No. 5,281,556 to Shimizu et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,656,605 to Clayton, U.S. Pat. No. 5,212,402 to Higgins III, U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,821 to Chern et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,283 to Hite, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,936 to Hernandez. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 4-188759 of Tachibana, a separate conductive member is interleaved with the lead frame paddle to form a capacitor. The separate member and paddle are respectively connected to the ground and Vcc bond pads of the overlying die. Somewhat similar structures using multi-layered capacitor construction are shown in German Patent DE 3626151 A 1 to Goetz, Japanese Patent Publication JP3165549A of Sato, Japanese Patent Publication No. JP4188759 of Masanori, Japanese Patent Publication No. JP4162657 of Hiroyuki, Japanese Publication No. JP3276747 of Natsuko, U.S. Pat. No. 5,140,496 of Heinks et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,891,687 of Mallik et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,654 of Karner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,613 of Daniels et al., and Shinko catalogue, Hyperquad Series Types, Three Metal Layer QFP (1994). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 5,444,600 to Dobkin et al. is shown a capacitor formed by interdigitated portions of a lead frame. Multiple semiconductor dies are mounted on separate paddles such that a ground connection to a first capacitor section and a power supply connection to a second capacitor section of the same capacitor couple are made from different semiconductor dies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,105,257 of Michii describes a lead frame construction including a planar ground lead, a portion of which is attached to a die, and two power supply leads, one on each side of the semiconductor die. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a lead frame construction which includes a decoupling capacitor for the power supply and ground circuits of a semiconductor device without requiring any additional parts. The portion of a lead frame otherwise used as a die attach paddle or as a pattern of inner lead-over-chip (LOC) leads is bifurcated and interdigitated to become an effective decoupling capacitor pair. Thus, the capacitor is totally within the device package without enlarging the dimensions of the package. In addition, the number of steps to produce the device is not increased, or only minimally increased over producing a semiconductor device having no decoupling capacitor. The additional complex manufacturing steps found in prior art methods for adding decoupling capacitance are avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In this description, the term &ldquo;active surface&rdquo; refers to the entire planar surface of a die, where a plurality of conductive bond pads is formed on the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;corresponding&rdquo; refers to any two conductive terminals which are intended to be conductively joined by a bond wire or other conductor toward achieving the desired device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> portion of an electrically conductive lead frame strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown generally with lateral rails <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The lead frame strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be formed from thin stamped metal or as a metallized polymeric film, e.g. as in tape automated bonding (TAB). The single lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown is but one of a plurality of lead frames which normally is part of the lead frame strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Registration holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the lateral rails <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are useful for accurate movement and alignment of the lead frame strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during lead frame manufacture, die attach, wire bonding, encapsulation, and lead singulation. The single lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of leads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprising inner lead portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and outer lead portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B. The leads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are supported by dam bars <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and cross bars <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which extend to the lateral rails <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as known in the art. The inner lead portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A terminate at a space <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which will surround a semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, not shown, for attachment of the inner lead portions to the semiconductor die by short wire conductors. In the example shown, the inner lead portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A are configured to be wire-bonded to bond pads along four edges of a die surface. Within the space <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is a paddle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for supporting such a die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In conformance with the invention, the single lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is manufactured with a two part die-attach member, i.e. &ldquo;paddle&rdquo; <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The paddle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is bifurcated into a first capacitor sector or portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and a second capacitor sector or portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B. Each capacitor portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B is supported by, i.e. connected to, one of the lateral rails <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by at least one paddle bar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B. First capacitor portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A is shown with first paddle bar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A, and second capacitor portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B is shown with second paddle bar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B. Shown on the capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B is a die mount outline <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> upon which a semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mounted (see drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). A trans-strip centerline is generally shown at <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and bisects the capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B and semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The two-part capacitor may be supported during construction by joining the two capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B with an insulative adhesive sheet or tape on either of the upper surface or lower surface of the capacitor portions. </paragraph>

An exemplary semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has its back side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> mounted on capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B, i.e. the two-piece paddle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, by a bonding medium <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which includes an electrically insulative material. Such materials are well known in the art and include adhesives and tapes formed of e.g. polyimide. As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the bonding medium <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comprises an insulative layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, such as polyimide tape, to which the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is bonded with an adhesive <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has an active surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> opposite the back side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and conductive bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are shown arrayed along the four edges <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the active surface. Other configurations of the lead frame strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used for semiconductor dice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> along fewer than four edges <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on the active surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to bond surfaces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the inner leads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A by bond wires <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, such as by the use of techniques well known in the art, e.g. thermocompression, thermosonic, and ultrasonic wire bonding methods. The bond wires <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are typically formed of gold, although other metals have been used. For the sake of clarity, many of the bond wires <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are not shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For purposes of illustration, capacitor portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A (see drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is designated as a power supply capacitor and its paddle bar <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A is connected by bond wire(s) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A to bond pad(s) <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A which are power supply terminals, e.g. Vss bond pads.

Thus, the capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B are directly connected to the appropriate bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by bond wires <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to provide capacitance in the power supply circuits and ground circuits very close to the die. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The configurations of capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B of paddle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which are depicted in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are not exhaustive. Other interdigitated patterns may be used, and their usability is subject to (a) matching of the electrical capacitance characteristics to the particular semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to achieve the desired decoupling, and (b) ease of manufacture and cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The paddle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the lead frame strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be depressed so that the active surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is more closely aligned with the bond surfaces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the inner lead portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, capacitor portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B is shown as being supported at a lower level than the inner leads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, and paddle bars <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B (and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A, not visible) extend from one level to the other. In contrast to the embodiment of drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the bond wires <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> may be shorter, and thus less susceptible to producing electronic interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Down-bonding of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the two-part paddle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may take a variety of forms in addition to that illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, for example, insulative layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be a layer of non-conducting adhesive such as epoxy or an adhesive coated tape formed of a polymer such as polyimide. While layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may entirely cover the die attach paddle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be connected by bond wires <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>C to the capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and/or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B by deleting the insulative layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> where a bond wire connection is to be made. The insulative layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be made to provide an exposed outer portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the capacitor portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and/or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B. Thus, short connections may be made from anywhere on the periphery of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention shown particularly in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, an electrically conductive lead frame strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has lateral rails <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with registration holes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of lead frames <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Each lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes integral interdigitated capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B which are attached in a lead-over-chip (LOC) fashion to the active die surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, i.e. to a portion thereof which does not contain bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Thus, the capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B are attached to the active surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> instead of the back side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B together comprise an interdigitated capacitative power bus and ground bus combination for the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The configuration of inner leads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A (with bonding surfaces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>) and outer leads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B is designed to accommodate the particular input/output bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of a semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the requirements of the host electronic apparatus to which the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is to be conductively joined. In the example of drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown with arrays <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B of conductive bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> along opposing long edges <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are connected to corresponding bonding surfaces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the inner leads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A by conductive bond wires <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as previously described. The part of the lead frame strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which comprises the capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B is positioned between the two opposing arrays <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B and bonded to the active surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, with intervening electrically insulative members <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Separation of the capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B from the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> prevents shorting therebetween. Insulative members <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be, for example, strips of polymer such as adhesive coated polyimide tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, each capacitor portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B includes a main bus <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>B respectively, parallel to centerline <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and joined to the lateral rails <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by support bars <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. From each bus <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>B extends inwardly a plurality of perpendicular legs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>B, respectively, which are sequentially alternated. Legs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>B are physically separated by a narrow space <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to provide the desired capacitative characteristics and to prevent shorting. A typical range of narrow space <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is from about 75 microns to about 200 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> This construction of the capacitor portions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B permits short wire bonding to either capacitor portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B from either bond pad array <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A (such as Vss) configured for attachment to a power supply capacitor portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A are bonded thereto by a bond wire <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A. Bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B (such as Vcc) which are configured for attachment to a ground capacitor portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B are bonded thereto by bond wire <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Following attachment of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the lead frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, completion of the wire bonding process, and any post-wire bond testing steps, the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and inner lead portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A are typically encapsulated with polymer such as epoxy to form the packaged device. The outer lead portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B are then singulated by cutting them free of the dam bars <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and cross bars <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Although the paddle bars <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B or support bars <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may be formed with conductive &ldquo;outer lead&rdquo; portions, in most cases, the paddle bars or support bars are cut free of the lateral rails, with only a small portion of the paddle bars remaining for the desired wire bonding to bond pads <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>B of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The outer leads <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B may be configured into any usable form, including conventional lead designs well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Thus, the lead frame strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be formed in general accordance with known processes and without changing the strip dimensions, number of levels, or materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is evident that the broad production processes in producing the above described semiconductor devices are no different from that of the prior art. However, the unique lead frame configuration and electrical connections made thereto provide a device with an effective integral decoupling capacitor construction without increasing or complicating the production steps, without requiring additional parts, without any increase in package size, and with a cost savings over other decoupling methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The heat transfer characteristics of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are not substantially changed by modifying the lead frame paddle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The devices formed by the foregoing methods also avoid the problems of package delamination which often occur when large planar plates are incorporated into a device, either above the die or below the lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The illustrated embodiments of the invention are by way of example only and are not intended to limit the scope thereof. The invention may be applied to other types of semiconductor devices, and the invention encompasses variations in capacitor shape, materials of construction, bonding methods, etc. The long dimension of the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> relative to the lead frame strip <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be rotated from the direction shown in the figures without changing the essence of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is apparent to those skilled in the art that such changes and modifications may be made to the capacitance enhanced semiconductor of the invention and its manufacturing method as disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. </paragraph>
