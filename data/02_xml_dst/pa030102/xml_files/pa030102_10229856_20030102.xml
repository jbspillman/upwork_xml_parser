<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method for adjusting the electrical length of a coaxial cable which has coaxial plug connectors on both cable ends. At least one of the plug connectors has an adjustable length. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Coaxial cables which have plug connectors on both ends are typically referred to as preformed cables, sometimes also as jumper cables. The specified electrical length of such preformed cables frequently has a rather tight tolerance. Although the electrical length of the preformed cable is related to its mechanical length, the predetermined nominal value of the electrical length can not be attained simply by cutting the cable to the corresponding mechanical length, even when the electrical length of the two plug connectors is taken into consideration. This is mainly due to the fact that the electrical length of a cable may vary over the mechanical length (due to small deviations of the dielectric constant and/or the characteristic impedance). Moreover, the tolerances added by cutting of the cable to a nominal length, by preparing the cable ends for installation of the plug connectors and finally the linear tolerances of the plug connectors themselves may invariably be greater than the tight tolerances required for the electrical length of the preformed cable. For this reason, the preformed cable is cut with sufficient excess length and its electrical length is adjusted by measuring the phase angle that corresponds to the electrical length with a phase measurement device, typically a vector network analyzer. This measurement is performed while changing the mechanical length of at least one of the plug connectors until the actual value of the phase angle is equal to be preset nominal value. It is known to use conventional plug connectors with an inner conductor having several sliding contacts that move telescopically inside of one another. The outer conductor is also made of several multi-part threaded sleeves that are screwed into each other. The telescopically moveable inner conductor elements are received in several insulator support members which center and guide the inner conductor of the connector. The threaded sleeves that form the outer conductor of the connector, are adjusted and secured in their final position, typically with lock nuts. The fabrication of preformed coaxial cables with a defined electrical length therefore necessitates the use of complex plug connectors having a large number of precision-machined parts which take-up space and require time-consuming manual adjustment, for example, by rotating the threaded sleeves that form a part of the outer conductor of the connector. The threaded sleeves must also be secured in the adjusted position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is therefore desirable to provide a simple and small plug connector with a low parts count, whose electrical length can be easily adjusted after installation on a coaxial cable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, a coaxial plug connector with an adjustable length includes an outer conductor located on the cable-side and adapted to be connected to an outer conductor of the cable. The connection-side outer conductor of the connector is received in the outer conductor located on the cable-side by a press fit and can be displaced in the axial direction by a distance (e). The inner conductor of the connector can be displaced in an insulator support member by at least the adjustment distance (e) of the connection-side outer conductor of the connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The plug connector includes has a low parts count and can be manufactured easily and inexpensively. The preformed cable can be shortened by controllably pressing the connection-side outer conductor of the connector into the cable-side outer conductor of the connector in an axial direction. The cable is manufactured with a sufficient positive tolerance relative to the nominal value of the electrical length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the cable-side outer conductor of the connector is adapted to be soldered to or crimped onto the outer conductor of the cable. These are inherently known connection methods which provide preformed cables with tight tolerances with the typically required high intermodulation separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the outer periphery of the cable-side outer conductor of the connector has a profile that is complementary to that of a thrust block. This arrangement provides the necessary axial support when the connection-side outer conductor of the connector is subsequently pressed into the cable-side outer conductor of the connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The outer periphery of the connection-side outer conductor of the connector can have an annular shoulder that limits its maximum adjustment distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the inner conductor of the connector can be formed in one-piece and adapted to be soldered to the inner conductor of the cable. This plug connector can be manufactured more cost-effectively than a plug connector with a conventional telescopic plug inner conductor which is supported by insulator support elements in several places. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for adjusting the electrical length of a coaxial cable with a respective coaxial plug connector on both ends. At least one of the plug connectors has a connection-side outer conductor that is received in the outer conductor located on the cable-side by a press fit and can be displaced in the axial direction by a distance (e). The inner conductor of the connector can be displaced in the insulator support member by at least the adjustment distance (e) of the connection-side outer conductor of the connector. The method includes the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> connecting a plug connector with a phase measurement device </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> shorting the plug connector having the adjustable length with a short-circuit plug </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> clamping the plug connector having the adjustable length and the short-circuit plug in a pressing device having a piston acting in an axial direction on the short-circuit plug, with the cable-side outer conductor of the connector of the plug connector being supported against a thrust block of the pressing device </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> shortening the electrical length of the cable by operating the pressing device until the electrical length reaches a preset nominal value as measured with the phase measurement device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the method, the pressing force is measured during the pressing operation, preferably as a function of the distance traveled by the piston. A check is performed to determine if the measurement value is greater than a minimum value and smaller than a maximum value. The pressing force can be measured either by using a press equipped with a force/distance measurement device, or by placing a force measurement device between the piston of the press and the short-circuit plug. If the measured pressing force is outside the tolerance limits defined by the minimum value and the maximum value, respectively, then the respective cable is discarded as scrap, because the plug connector may not have sufficient mechanical strength If the pressing force is too small, and the plug connector can be mechanically damaged if the pressing force is too large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments illustrated in the drawings and from the claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a coaxial plug connector which has an adjustable length and is installed on one end of a coaxial cable. The cable is constructed in the usual manner and has a inner conductor of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a dielectric <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a the cable outer conductor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which in this case is a braided outer conductor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The plug connector includes an inner conductor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is moveably disposed on an isolator support member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A conventional connecting sleeve <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with an indicated inner thread <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is loosely and rotatably disposed on the outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the connector. The cable-side end of the outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the connector is received with a press fit in an outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the connector which is soldered with its end facing the cable-side to the braided outer conductor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the position indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and before the adjustment process described below, the outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the connector can be pressed further into the cable-side outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the connector by a maximum distance &ldquo;e&rdquo; which indicates the maximum available adjustment distance. The inner conductor of the connector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which has the same diameter as the region of the isolator support member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, extends by at least the same adjustment distance &ldquo;e&rdquo; in the direction of the cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An annular shoulder <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is disposed on the outer periphery of the cable-side outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the connector. During the adjustment, this annular shoulder supports the outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the connector against a thrust block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the relative position of the elements of the plug connector after an adjustment, where the maximum available adjustment distance &ldquo;e&rdquo; is exhausted. An annular collar <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the connector herein contacts the annular shoulder <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the connector. For this purpose, a short-circuit plug <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a known electrical length is placed on the connection side of the plug connector. A pressing force F exerts pressure on the bottom <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the short-circuit plug <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which pushes the outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the connector into the outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the connector up to a limit stop. The inner conductor of the cable <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has displaced the inner conductor of the connector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the isolator support member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the same distance towards the connection side. The inner conductor of the connector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is shown on the connection side as an exemplary pin, projects over the connection-side end face of the isolator support member by a distance &ldquo;e&rdquo; that is equal to the adjustment distance &ldquo;e&rdquo;. However, the inner conductor of the connector <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> remains within the tolerance determined by the respective plug standard. This is insignificant in this case, because the electrical separation and reference plane of the plug connector coincides with the connection-side end face of the outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the connector. In other words, it is immaterial how far the pin-shaped inner conductor of the connector projects into the female inner conductor of the abutting plug connector that is formed as a coupler. The same applies for the female inner conductor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the short-circuit plug <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a coaxial cable <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> which has respective plug connectors <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> located on both ends. At least one of the plug connectors <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, in this case the plug connector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, has an adjustable length, as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The plug connector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the applied short-circuit plug <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are received in a thrust block <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The plug connector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> disposed on the other end of the preformed cable <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected via a mating connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to a network analyzer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The network analyzer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> displays the phase angle representing the preset nominal value of the respective preformed cable as well as the measured value, which is initially greater than the nominal value. The piston <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of a press <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> presses via the short-circuit plug <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> the connection-side outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the connector into the cable-side outer conductor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the connector, until the actual value of the phase angle attained by shortening the preformed cable electrically (which is equivalent to shortening the cable mechanically) is equal to the nominal value. This operation can be performed manually or automatically. The press <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a display <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for displaying the actual value of the pressing force which, for the reasons already discussed above, has to remain within a predetermined tolerance range. If the available adjustment distance of the plug connector <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is insufficient and if the plug connector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is also constructed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, then the electrical length of the cable can be further adjusted by interchanging the roles of the plug connectors <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The required adjustment distance is typically only several tenths of a millimeter and rarely exceeds 1 or 2 mm, since the operating frequencies of phase-compensated cables are generally in the GHz range. </paragraph>
