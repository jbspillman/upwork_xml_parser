<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The sputtering target with a lowered oxygen content according to the present invention contains an oxygen scavenger comprising an element capable of reducing metal components constituting the sputtering target, the lowered oxygen content of the sputtering target having been achieved by the oxygen scavenger. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described in more detail with reference to the production process of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In, the production process according to the present invention, in vacuo, constituent metal materials for constituting a sputtering target are melted, and the melt is then cast. The melting-casting process per se may be carried out by a conventional process. After casting, the cast ingot thus obtained is optionally rolled, followed by machining (for example, cutting) to provide a predetermined sputtering target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The sputtering target with a lowered oxygen content according to the present invention is applicable to an NiFe-base, CoCrPt-base, CoCrPtB-base, CoPt-base, PtMn-base, FeAlSi-base, FeCo-base, or FeMn-base sputtering target. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the sputtering target is an NiFe-base, Co-base, or Fe-base target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferred production processes will be described for each type of the alloy system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the case of an NiFe-base alloy system, the step of melting and casting is carried out, for example, under a vacuum of not more than 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Torr. The resultant cast ingot is rolled at a temperature of about 1,100&deg; C. to provide a rolled plate which is then cut to a product size, followed by machining such as lathing or milling. Thus, a sputtering target is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the case of a CoCrPt-base alloy system, the step of melting and casting is carried out, for example, under a vacuum of not more than 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>Torr. The resultant cast ingot is rolled at a temperature of about 1,100 to 1,200&deg; C. to provide a rolled plate which is then cut to a product size, followed by machining such as lathing or milling. Thus, a sputtering target is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the case of a PtMn-base alloy system, the step of melting and casting is carried out, for example, under a vacuum of not more than 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>Torr. The resultant cast ingot is subjected to machining, such as lathing or milling, to produce a sputtering target. This sputtering target is generally joined to a predetermined backing plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the sputtering target according to the present invention, an oxygen scavenger comprising an element capable of reducing metal components for constituting the sputtering target is added in the step of melting and casting. A lowering in oxygen content has been achieved by this oxygen scavenger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The oxygen scavenger added is preferably at least one member selected from the group consisting of group 4A, 3B, and 4B elements, more preferably at least one member selected from the group consisting of group 4A elements, particularly preferably at least one member selected from the group consisting of titanium, aluminum, boron, and carbon. According to the present invention, the oxygen scavenger is most preferably titanium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, in the step of melting and casting, in particular, when the base metal in the melting is iron, it is considered that the presence of an oxygen scavenger, for example, titanium, permits the following reaction to proceed in the molten metal: 2/3Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&plus;Ti&equals;TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;4/3Fe. TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>floats, on the surface of a molten metal, as dross (a scum component of oxides) which, therefore, can be effectively removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present inventor has found that the oxygen content can be further lowered by carrying out the step of melting (dissolution) and/or casting in a CaO crucible. The present inventor has further found that the use of a combination of the CaO crucible with titanium among the above-described oxygen scavengers can offer improved oxygen scavenging effect surpassing the expected effect, and, at the same time, can offer desulfurization effect. The development of this advantageous cooperative function and effect attained by the above combination is particularly significant in a PtMn-base sputtering target. It has hitherto been relatively difficult to scavenge oxygen from the PtMn-base sputtering target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The reason why the above advantageous cooperative function and effect can be developed has not been fully elucidated yet. However, the reason is believed to be as follows, although the present invention is not limited to any theory. Specifically, TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as a deoxidation product in the molten metal is absorbed in the CaO crucible according to the following reaction formula:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>CaO&plus;TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;CaO&middot;TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> At that time, on the wall surface of the crucible, CaO effectively functions to simultaneously cause a desulfurization reaction according to the following reaction formula:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Ti&plus;2CaO&plus;2S&equals;2CaS&plus;TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The amount of the oxygen scavenger added in the step of melting and casting is properly selected according to the estimated content of dissolved oxygen. In general, however, the amount of the oxygen scavenger added is suitably in the range of 0.001 to 1.0% by weight, preferably in the range of 0.001 to 0.5% by weight, more preferably in the range of 0.001 to 0.5% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In particular, in the PtMn-base sputtering target, in melting platinum and manganese in the CaO crucible, the addition of titanium preferably in an amount of 0.001 to 3% by weight, more preferably 0.01 to 0.5% by weight, based on the amount of manganese can lower the oxygen content, for example, to not more than 50 ppm. Further, in this case, the amount of residual titanium can be reduced to not more than 200 ppm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the Addition of the oxygen scavenger in the above amount range permits the content of oxygen in the sputtering target to be regulated to not more than 500 ppm, more preferably not more than 300 ppm, particularly preferably not more than 10 ppm. Further, in particular, in the case of an NiFe-base, Co-base, or Fe-base sputtering target, the oxygen content can be regulated to not more than 10 ppm, more preferably not more than 5 ppm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the concentration of the residual oxygen scavenger in the sputtering target after the removal of oxygen is not more than 200 ppm, preferably not more than 100 ppm, more preferably not more than 50 ppm. The present inventor has found that a concentration of the residual oxygen scavenger of not more than 100 ppm does not adversely affect the properties of the sputtering target.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As a result, for a sample on melting without the addition of titanium, the oxygen content was 35 ppm, whereas, for the sample on melting with the addition of titanium, the oxygen content was 9 ppm. The amount of titanium remaining in the sample was 70 ppm. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Sputtering targets were produced in the same manner as in Examples 1 to 3, except that a CaO crucible was used instead of the MgO crucible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> For the sputtering targets thus obtained, the oxygen content was as follows, and, for all the targets, the results were satisfactorily good. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> NiFe-base target: oxygen content 3 ppm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> PtMn-base target: oxygen content 40 ppm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> CoCrPtTa-base target: oxygen content 5 ppm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As is apparent also from the results of the examples, the sputtering target according to the present invention contains an oxygen scavenger comprising an element capable of reducing metal components constituting the sputtering target, the lowered oxygen content of the sputtering target having been achieved by the oxygen scavenger. Thus, the present invention can provide a sputtering target with a lowered oxygen content which can prevent a deterioration in properties of magnetic films caused by unavoidably included oxygen present in an alloy material system, and, hence, is very useful from the viewpoint of industry. </paragraph>
