<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to radio frequency identification, and more specifically to a tracking system, method, and components for use with radio frequency identification. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Numerous systems exist for the physical tracking of inventory, raw materials, materials in manufacture, or other items in a variety of locations, such as manufacturing facilities, libraries, offices, and the like. Accurate and inexpensive locating, tracking, and inventorying of the physical location of items such as parts, goods, and materials is a necessity for many operations, such as manufacturing and warehousing, for a number of reasons. Such reasons include the desire or need to quickly determine the physical location of a part in the manufacturing process, or to determine whether a part is present in inventory or storage, to determine the quantity of an item on hand, to track the progress of an item in manufacture, and many other such functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Apparatuses and methods for the performance of the tracking of material and the performance of inventory-like processes have evolved over time. For example, inventory strategies have been modified from the hand tallying of stock and location in a notebook or the like, to sophisticated computer driven hardware and software for tracking inventory. Traditionally, a full inventory operation could close an entire facility, such as a retail store, warehouse, or manufacturing plant, for a day or more every time a detailed inventory was required. The large costs associated with physically shutting down an operation to do inventory were and are a known cost of the operation of many businesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An accurate record of the items available in a store or warehouse, as well as their location, is a key component of successfully operating a business. Knowing what is on hand allows the skilled manager or supply personnel to make informed ordering decisions. Knowledge of the availability and location of items or parts in a facility decreases the amount of time necessary for retrieval of such items, thereby increasing overall efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The advent of computers, and their rapid entrenchment into mainstream businesses and personal life, has also led to an advent in tracking items and performing and maintaining an inventory. For example, when physical inventory was still routinely performed by hand, a database could be created and maintained to track inventory in a more dynamic fashion. The potential errors of misplacing the physical inventory sheet, and the potential corruption of the physical inventory record were replaced with the increasingly lower incidence of potential errors of lost data and data corruption. Data entry error still also posed potential human error problems. Still, the computerized storage and retrieval of inventory information allowed for various sorting and categorization of data not previously easily available. The database functions of hand entered computer inventories were readily extended to other material tracking endeavors such as warehousing, stocking, ordering, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As technology continued to advance, various apparatuses and methods for tracking the inventory of a retail store, manufacturing plant, warehouse, and the like, in real-time or near real-time, were placed into use. Production lot tracking technology systems had and have widely varied capability, success, ease of use, and cost. Currently proposed and available lot tracking technologies include manual keyboard entry, bar coding, and proprietary systems such as those provided by JENOPTIK, Fluoroware, Micron Communications, Inc., and Omron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Manual keyboard entry of lot numbers of parts in a lot tracking or inventory situation is already in use in many facilities. Such systems are not automated, but instead are manually performed. The physical inventory process is still undertaken, and generally the information gathered is entered into a computerized database. Data entry errors due to human error are in large part an unavoidable part of the manual inventory process. Such errors are difficult if not impossible to track and correct. Any information which is desired or required to be obtained and stored or entered into a computer or other system beyond a simple inventory creates additional work for the inventory taker. The time it takes to perform an inventory using manual keyboard entry of lot numbers and the like is not significantly less than traditional pencil and paper inventories which often require the full or at least partial shutdown of an entire facility. Such an inventory process is subject to high costs reflected not necessarily in terms of equipment, but in terms of employee-hours and lost revenues from a shutdown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Because of its advantages over manual inventory, whether using a computer for further organization or not, bar coding has become commonplace in many if not most retail outlets and warehouses, grocery stores, chains, and large retail outlets. hI a bar coding scheme, an identifying label containing encoded information is placed on the goods, parts, part bin, or other item to be identified by a bar code reader. The encoded information is read by the reader with no user data entry generally required. This is referred to as keyless data entry. The information encoded on the bar code is then typically passed to a computer or other processing medium for decoding and data entry. Such data entry is largely error free due to the decreased reliance on error-prone human activities. Bar code data entry is also typically faster than manual data entry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Bar coding is a common and easy to implement technology. However, bar coding requires a scanner or reader for every terminal, or a portable scanner which is moved around from location to location. Further, bar coding requires a separate label for implementation. Without further data entry, which has additional associated costs and potential error factors, other desired or required information such as an exact location of the scanned item is unknown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another type of lot tracking system uses an infrared lot box micro terminal with a pager-like display for lot tracking. A micro terminal is physically attached to each lot box. Each micro terminal communicates via infrared communication with an infrared (IR) transceiver grid, which must be in sight of the micro terminal in order for the system to function properly. Typically, the IR transceiver grid is positioned or installed along the ceiling of a facility. Stacked pallets, lots, or wafer boats will be unreadable using an IR system. The micro terminals and IR transceiver grid of the IR system are expensive. A micro terminal system requires an elaborate software platform, but does allow for reduced data entry error, faster data entry, and simple user entries. The IR system requires a major procedural change in the standards for performing lot tracking. The micro terminals must also be positioned in a specific orientation with respect to the transceiver grid for proper functioning. The terminal must be physically attached to a lot box to be tracked. Lot location can only be identified to an area as small as the IR field of view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another lot tracking system is available from Fluoroware. This system uses passive tags in a cassette. The passive tags are scanned by a scanning station over which an item, wafer boat, or lot which has been tagged passes. The item, lot, or boat is identified when it passes over the scanning station. Often, wafer boats are specific to the particular station, but parts may be moved to a number of different locations. Tracking a cassette may require a large amount of reassociation of the tag information to accurately track the part or item. The scanning stations of the Fluoroware system are expensive, on the order of $2,000-$3,000 per station. Additionally, a main computer to centralize, organize, and coordinate operation of the tracking system is required. The Fluoroware system, like other more automated systems, reduces data entry error and data entry time. The tags used in the system are relatively low in cost, and can be embedded into boats. However, many controllers are needed for the system, and the scanning stations have a high cost. Further, the reassociation of tags with different locations requires extra data entry or tag reprogramming, which introduces further potential errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> When an inventory or lot tracking system works with a large number of parts or locations, which may number into the thousands of locations and many thousands if not millions of parts, the systems described above become unwieldy to effectively operate, become cost prohibitive, or both. Further, with a large number of parts and locations, an exact location match is difficult if not impossible to provide with the above systems. Such a lack of ability to pinpoint the location of a part further hinders the operation and effectiveness of the above systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Additionally, items or lots in a manufacturing facility may sit in a certain location without being used or moved for weeks or more. In addition, the pallets of wafer boats in such a facility or storage area may be stacked in stacks five or more layers deep. Personnel are often assigned to physically search all lots to find a lot which may be missing. Lots in large manufacturing facilities have been known to be lost for 6 months to a year. A more accurate tracking system for lots would be desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In manufacturing situations, other tracking of inventory and parts is often desirable or necessary. Such other tracking may include tracking the amount of time a part spends between stations, the amount of time it takes for a part to complete a certain operation, a history of the travel of a part from start to finish of a manufacturing or fabrication operation, and the like. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PHYSICAL OVERVIEW </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> An implementation of a portion of a container tracking and identification system according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> dual nesting station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown upon which an item or container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be placed. Hereafter, reference to container will mean any item which may be tracked by the present invention. The dual nesting station contains two locations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> where containers may be placed and tracked according to the present invention. A dual nesting station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown as an exemplary embodiment, however, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that a single nesting station <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be implemented, or any plurality of nesting stations may be implemented in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The nesting stations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be implemented as a generally flat component which may be placed wherever there is a need to track a container, or it may be formed as an integral part of a shelf, pallet, bench, table, or any other location where items or containers are located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Each nesting station includes an antenna <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> imbedded within of upon each nesting stations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Other circuitry, not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> but described below, is used to send and receive signals to and from an RFID tag <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> imbedded within or placed upon container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, when container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed in proximity to nesting station <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, communication of signals between container RFID tag <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and antenna <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is possible. These communication signals will be more fully described below. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SYSTEM OVERVIEW </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of a system of the present invention is shown in block diagram. Lot tracking system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a host or control module <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> operatively connected to a plurality of interrogators <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The interrogators <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are each have a plurality of sensing antennas and circuitry <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> operatively connected to the main interrogator body by connection lines. The interrogators <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, are preferably local to the sensing antenna circuits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The sensing antenna circuits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are positioned so that they are in sensing proximity to a location at or over which a plurality of containers may be located or pass. Each container (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is capable of holding items such as lots of wafers used to manufacture integrated circuits. In such an application of the present invention, the container is termed a &ldquo;boat&rdquo; and would hold lots of partially fabricated or fully fabricated wafers which may be routed through the plurality steps required in the IC fabrication at an IC foundry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Each container has an attached Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tag <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) capable of being excited by the sensing antenna circuits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, capable of relaying, conveying, or communicating identification information to the sensing antenna circuits, and on to the control module <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The tags are preferably low frequency passive RFID tags <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which carry a serial number or identification number which can be cross-referenced within a database or other data structure maintained by the control module <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or one of its components. Each interrogator <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> contains drive electronics and detection circuitry to excite and read back identification information contained on a tag. Driving information is communicated to the tag through the antenna coil or primary of an electromagnetically coupled circuit. The data out on the communication line <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is linkable to the host or control module system for other action. Tags are polled by exciting the sensing antenna circuits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which induces a current in the tag <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, causing it to communicate its stored information, which will be described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The RFID tags <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> contain generally simple information, but the tag information may be as widely varied as the uses for the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> itself. For example, tags can contain simple presence/no presence bit, or detailed information regarding an entire build process, or specifications about lot number, serial number, and the like. The radio frequency of the interrogator powers up the tag, and the carrier frequency (usually 125 KHZ for passive tags in one embodiment) becomes the clocking frequency to generate a clock to clock the data out. Passive tags can be made and used very inexpensively, making them more economical for use with multiple read locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In one arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, interrogator <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to a plurality of sensing antenna circuits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a nesting station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> via connection lines <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In this arrangement, two quad-nesting stations are shown. In another arrangement, interrogator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to a plurality of sensing antenna circuits <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> on quad nesting station <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> via connection line <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and to antennas <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of dual nesting station <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> via connection line <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. In yet another arrangement, interrogator <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to a plurality of antenna circuits <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> on a dual nesting station <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via connection line <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and to antenna circuits <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> on another dual nesting station <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> via connection line <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Further interrogators may be added to the embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to accommodate more nesting stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Control module <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may include such components as a computer with a database of information pertaining to lot numbers, lot locations, and other lot information for the items in container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Control module <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> controls the interrogators <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to poll appropriate locations to gather and maintain information about containers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The connection lines of embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may comprise a plurality types of connections such as standard flat phone cables with a phone jack connector to attached to multiple sensing antennas. Depending upon the configuration of the nesting station to which the connection lines are connected, the telephone cables used in embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be four conductor flat phone cables, eight conductor flat phone cables, or a combination of such cables. The connector phone jack may be an RJ-11 type four conductor jack, or an RJ-45 type eight conductor jack, depending upon the type of cable connection. Flat telephone cable is used so that the drive signals for the antenna circuits (described below) are physically separated from the sense line and are readily available at low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, twisted pair cabling may be used in a network environment. In such a configuration, the detection and ground wires (described below) would be twisted together, and the drive signal lines would be twisted together. Only one drive wire is active at any one time. One antenna circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is driven at a time, and a common detection circuit is used for all of the antennas. The drive signal is switched from one antenna circuit to the next using a multiplexor (MUX). The switching may be sequential, ordered, or random, but only one antenna circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is driven at any one given time. This allows the use of a common detection processor detection circuit which is used for each antenna circuit of the plurality of antenna circuits that are wired into each interrogator. The multiplexor selects which antenna circuit is being driven by the drive signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The jacks for the connection can be standard telephone connection jacks, selected for their availability and low cost. Those skilled the art will readily recognize that a wide variety if wire types, wiring configurations and electrical connectors may be used in the implementation of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Nesting stations have been described above as single-, dual- or quad-, but many other arrangements of nesting stations is possible with the present invention. For the example of tracking boxes of semiconductor wafers, each nesting station would be typically implemented as a dual nesting station sized to be approximately one foot by 2 feet to form a suitably sized location for two typical 200 millimeter wafer boxes which have a footprint of approximately one square foot. This is referred to as a 1&times;2 pad. A 2&times;2 pad would be implemented with as a quad nesting station described above and would be approximately two feet by two feet in size. Thus, a 2&times;2 would be a quad nesting station for four semiconductor wafer boxes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> For a 1&times;2 pad nesting station such as nesting station <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, an RJ-11 four conductor jack may be used to connect the four conductor telephone cables <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, respectively, to the antenna circuits <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> respectively. For a 2&times;2 pad nesting station such as nesting station <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, an RJ-45 eight conductor jack may be used to connect the eight conductor telephone cable <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> respectively to the antenna circuits <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, instead of an eight conductor cable such as cable <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or cable <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, two four conductor cables can be used side by side in an RJ-45 jack. In this case, the opposite ends of the four conductor cables may be fitted with RJ-11 phone jacks for ease of connection. This configuration is useful for connection of two 1&times;2 pads such as pads <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to a single interrogator such as interrogator <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, cables <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> may be four conductor telephone cables, each having an RJ-11 jack for connection of the cables to the nesting stations <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The two cables <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> plug into a single RJ-45 eight position jack to connect the cables to interrogator <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. When two four connector cables are used in a single RJ-45 eight conductor jack, they are mirrored so as to place the detector circuit, that is the signal that has been rectified and has the greatest noise sensitivity, on the outside of the cable where it is furthest from the drive electronics. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">NESTING PAD DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an exemplary embodiment of a 2&times;2 pad <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> implemented with two 1&times;2 pads <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, along with the antenna circuitry, arranged in a mirrored configuration (discussed below) in schematic diagram form. A connection <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> for cabling to the interrogator has eight contact positions <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> which may comprise two four conductor RJ-11 jacks, or a single eight conductor RJ-45 jack as described above. Each 1&times;2 pad <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> has a four conductor RJ-11 jack connecting its four contact positions, <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> respectively, to an appropriate four conductor cable to the interrogator. As shown, the physical layout of contact positions <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> mirrors that of the physical layout of contact <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, with position <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and position <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> being adjacent within the 2&times;2 pad <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. This mirrored configuration places the detection circuit, that is the rectified signal with the greatest noise sensitivity, on the outside of the cable. The detector conductors (position <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) are therefore placed away from the drive signal conductors (positions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) by the ground conductors (position <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) to help eliminate noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The antennas used in embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> preferably each comprise a flat coil, a flat radial single layer antennas comprising a length of copper wire which is coiled to form an antenna. The flat coil construction allows some degree of side to side movement of the antenna without significant degradation of performance. Further, the flat coil antenna construction also provides relatively good height detection of the antenna without drastically affecting the performance of the system. A flat coil is less sensitive to surrounding metal surfaces in the same plane as the coil. Other antennas could also be used. Representative embodiments of antennas will be discussed further below. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">ANTENNA CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a top view of a representative embodiment of a flat antenna coil <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Antenna coil <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises a length of coiled wire <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, such as copper wire. Although copper wire is preferred, other conductive wires and embodiments are well within the scope of the invention, as will be known by one of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a top view of another embodiment <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of an antenna. Antenna <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> comprises a substantially circular magnetic core <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> having an annular ring <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> extending from the core <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> to form a magnetic cup. A magnetic center post <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> extends from the core <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> approximately at the center of core <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, in the same direction as the annular ring <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. Coil windings <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> are wrapped around the center post <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows a section view of antenna <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> taken along lines <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows focused flux lines <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> from the focused antenna <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, each antenna circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> form a tuned tank circuit which is connected to interrogators <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The interrogators contain circuitry for excitation of the tuned tank circuits and for detection of the information transmitted by an excited RFID tag. Since the nesting stations are somewhat remote from the interrogators, the tuned circuit embodiment <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the present invention places a capacitor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in close proximity to the antenna coil <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, so that the entire tank circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is remote. Therefore the cable length and type can vary or be changed without affecting the operation of the antenna <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and drive electronics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will recognize that if the capacitive element and the antenna coil were separated, with the capacitive element located at an interrogator would require that the interrogator be part of the tuned circuit. Cabling between the antenna (nesting station) and the capacitive element (interrogator) would be a factor in deciphering information from any excited tag. In such a configuration, when the location of the antenna changed, the tuning of the circuit changed. This latter configuration would be problematic since tuning the tank circuit for proper operation would be time consuming. By placing the entire tank circuit in the nesting station, the components of the system are readily interchangeable and cabling lengths are not a factor in the proper operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In operation, the interrogator drives the tuned tank circuit comprised of series connected elements <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> with a square wave power signal. In an exemplary embodiment, the drive signal operates at 125 kHz, capacitor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is 3000 picoFarads and antenna coil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is 800 microHenrys. The square wave drive signal is smoothed to a nearly a sine wave signal which is emitted from the antenna coil <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to excite RFID tag <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The excited tag emits a signal containing information unique to the tag (such as a serial number). This signal from the tag is detected by antenna coil <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, rectified by diode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and sent to the interrogator for demodulation. The diode <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> generates a rectified peak voltage of the tank circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the detected signal appears as a pulse stream in the form of a series of dips in the 125 kHz rectified carrier signal. This pulse stream is then decoded by the interrogator for the data it carries. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INTERROGATOR DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> An embodiment <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of an interrogator is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> which includes a processor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and an antenna reader circuit <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Antennas are connectable to the interrogator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> at connection point <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, and connection to the power supply and host or control module is effected at point <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. Power for operating the interrogator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be obtained locally or it may be received through the host communication cable. Communication of processor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> with host or control module <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is accomplished through port <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Host protocol interface port <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be a serial communication RS-232 port, or a differential port such as a multi-drop IEEE 485 or non multi-drop IEEE 422. The host or control module processes instructions according to a predefined operational structure, issuing commands to the interrogator for control of multiplexor <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> which selects the antenna which is to be driven at any given time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, each antenna connected to the interrogator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has a dedicated power driver <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> circuit to generate the square wave excitation signal. The preferred power driver for the antennas is a low cost CMOS power driver to drive the square wave which is converted to a sine wave by the tuned circuit. In this example, each antenna has its own power driver within the interrogator because an electronic multiplexor switch with a low on resistance would be more expensive than the CMOS drivers. It is desirable to use power drivers with fast rise times, such as MOSFET and CMOS power drivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Details of the power driver circuitry are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Drivers <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> have a fast rise time and radiate a high frequency harmonic because of that. To slow the rise time, drivers <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> are each connected to the antenna drive voltage through an inductor <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. Further, an inductor <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> is electrically interposed between each driver <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> and ground. The inductors <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> are used to slow the rises and fall times of the driver <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> to reduce harmonic radiated RF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Once the sensing antennas have excited a tag, the information received from tank circuit such as circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is sent to interrogator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and detected by detector <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> along a sense line <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight>. Since only one antenna is excited at a time, all detector sense lines <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight> from all nesting stations may be wired to the same detector. Processor or microchip controller <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> decodes data from the detector circuit <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and can provide for sequential, ordered, or random scanning of the ports of the system through antenna selector <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Detector circuit <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is preferably implemented with analog amplification/detection of the DC rectified signal of the diode of the tuned circuit. The detected signal can be provided to processor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> where each detection circuit <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> also has decoding capabilities, such as digital signal processing (DSP) type decoding built in. Each multiplexor board could have its own detector and processor, allowing for the driving of multiple antennas at once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> of interrogator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be essentially a microcomputer, that is an all in one chip with on board RAM, EPROM, I/O points, a microprocessor, and analog input. The processor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> could have hard-coded (burned into PROM) control software, or it could download the control software from a separate processor or computer system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The interrogator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is preferably positioned in close proximity to the sensing antenna, which reduces the bundle of wires that must be run from the interrogator to the host computer or control module. From the interrogator, a low cost serial port may be used to run power into the interrogator along a communication line from the host. This allows for a wide operating voltage, which is preferably maintained low (24V for example) for safety purposes, but high enough that there is a low current draw. In this exemplary implementation, there is only one cable which needs to be disconnected in the event that the interrogator must be moved. In some environments, this a fairly common event. Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> single interrogator may be located on the shelving units and serving all nesting stations of this shelf unit. If the shelf is to be moved, only one cable need be disconnected from the host. That cable my be a wall jack with in-the-wall network wires running to the host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> To keep the efficiency of the system up and power current down, voltage regulation circuitry <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> is used to perform regulation of unregulated 24V power to regulated 12V and 5V power. In one embodiment, DC to DC voltage regulators are used to perform main power reduction from an unregulated 24V power supply to a regulated 12V and 5V power supply to drive the interrogator components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, communications coming through host protocol interface <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> could be jumpered to an auxiliary processor board <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> that may contain an auxiliary processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and wide variety of optional communication or I/O protocols <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>, such as ETHERNET, wireless modem, another processor with a large amount of memory, or the like. In such a configuration, the entire interrogator system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> runs without interaction between the interrogator and the host. Gathered information may be downloaded to the host or control module at a later time. If no auxiliary processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is present, then the connections which would go to the COM and COM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> ports of the auxiliary processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> are jumpered together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of auxiliary functions could also be performed by such an auxiliary control I/O <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> piggybacked to the circuit <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. A daughterboard <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> with auxiliary input/output capability could be used to unlock doors, generate alarm signals, including local alarm signals for an object removed from a nesting station or boat, or the location from which an object has been removed, or drive an operator interface display terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> An interrogator system embodiment <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> comprises tags <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and an interrogator <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. Each tag <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is associated with a specific lot, and contains identification information specific to the lot or item to which the tag is attached. Each tag <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> may be attached to a lot box or the like. Each tag, when excited, will communicate a signal indicative of its identification information. The tag can carry such information as a serial number and the like, which may be cross-referenced in a database maintained at the system host (computer). Antennas <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> are positioned in close proximity to the lot location which they will be polling. Interrogator <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is connected to antennas <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> by a communication line <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, which in the example shown will be a four line conductor. Connection jacks <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> connect the communication line <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> to the interrogator <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the nesting station <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> respectively. As discussed above, a four line conductor will typically be terminated with an RJ-11 four conductor jack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Tags <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, as has been mentioned above, are typically passive tags. This reduces the overall tag cost, which is important since a large number of tags may be required in application. The passive tags <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, which allow for low cost, generally have a short effective operating range. The range may be on the order of 0 to 15-20 inches, depending upon antenna size. The larger the antenna, the greater the operating range. In one embodiment, the present invention limits the tag range further, preferably on the order of two (2) inches. Taking advantage of this short range allows this embodiment of the present invention to excite a tag and obtain its information, while also determining its exact location. Further, with simple timing and recordation schemes, it is possible given the precise nature of multiple antenna locations and close discrimination between lots to know which part is at which exact location at any given time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Each interrogator has an address stored in interrogator address module <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>, which may be a volatile or a non-volatile memory. Each antenna connection has a sub-address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Each antenna array location has its own unique identification information or address. In this way, the unique address can be programmed into the system, so that the physical location is not determined by where the antenna array is plugged in, but by what the address of the array has been programmed to. Then, under that address each antenna point will have its own address, allowing resolution down to each specific individual shelf and position. The system resolves exactly where each item is. This allows the mapping of a shelf and/or a location for a graphics display or the like, to locate an item with specificity. The reduced range of the antennas of this embodiment of the present invention allow for such a close up representation of exact item position. The range of on the order of two inches allows the reading of each tag to a precise location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> For example, in a wafer production fabrication, there may be 1000 lot boxes running production wafers, and 1000 lots of test wafers, plus 500 lots of reference type wafers, all at a general location. This results in 2500 lot boxes in a physical space. This can represent upwards of 5000 locations, because of the open queue space which is needed to move lots through such an operation. A system which works must be low cost and distributed to allow for multiple read locations, and inexpensive read points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> With a large number of locations to be polled, multiple interrogators will be required. Each interrogator concentrates multiple antenna locations into one interrogator. Typically in a wafer production line, production shelves are 2&times;4, or eight lots per shelf. Racks of shelves may be stacked six shelves high, and may have 32-56 boats per rack. Typically, the maximum number of boats per rack is 60. With two telephone cable per shelf, a single location may have 12 eight conductor flat cables running from the location to the interrogator. The benefits of local interrogators multiply with increased numbers of read locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> With an interrogator having 60 antennas, 60 sets of data are collected and stored internally. At the next polling, only absolute differences are considered. That is, the delta data is polled. If only one of the sets of data has changed, it is the only set of data transmitted. This reduces the amount of data required to be transmitted. A complete polling may be taken at a specified interval or number of scans, in one embodiment every 100 scans. Further, tag information transmitted may be limited in one embodiment. Some tags contain an amount of user specific information that is the same for every tag associated with that user. If all tags polled are for a certain customer or user, then certain identification information need not be transmitted. Also, tags out of range of a certain specified parameter can be flagged, or an alarm can be given. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> With 180 interrogators in a room, multiple options are available. First, all interrogators could be local, taking gathered information from its read locations or bays and sending the information into a switched multidrop configuration. This configuration would result in some data throughput difficulties (long time between individual location interrogation), but in a slow changing environment this may not be critical. Problems with such a multidrop configuration is that it places more equipment in the field, creating more service locations and an increased number of locations for things to break down. In one embodiment, communication drops to each interrogator are all sent back to a communications room in a star configuration which is in turn connected to the host. However, the scale could be dropped down to individual or a small number of components together on a power supply depending on the facility requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, an infrared link may be positioned on an interrogator, or located remote to an interrogator, and an infrared transceiver pod could be positioned on the ceiling of a room, for obtaining by infrared the location information gathered by each interrogator. Power would still need to be provided to each interrogator, most likely on a cable, but full data communication links to the host would not be required. Other technologies could also be supported, such as cellular phone, pager, wireless modem, solar power, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an embodiment <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of another system embodying the present invention. Multiplexor <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> has a plurality of connections to single antennas <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, . . . </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n, </italic></highlight>which are driven by drivers <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. A common detector circuit <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> is connected in parallel to each of the drivers <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>and to controller <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> controls selection of which antenna <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> is to be active at any given time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the invention as described above, the use of a flat coil antenna has been shown to allow some lateral movement of the boxes to allow for positioning tolerances without significant degradation of performance. Further, the flat coil antenna construction also provides relatively good height detection of the antenna without drastically affecting the performance of the system. A flat coil is more sensitive to ferrous materials in the vicinity of the coil. However, if the shelf or nesting station upon which tags are placed is composed of a material such as wood, plastic, and the like instead of metal, then a balance between separation of the antenna from the shelf and the performance of the antenna is not an issue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> If the height or distance of the antenna from the tag increases, the communication or readability degrades. As the height or distance decreases, the tuned circuit becomes detuned. Further, if a ferrous material object such as a wrench, clipboard, or pad is placed on or in close proximity to the nesting station or antenna, a voltage anomaly due to the object may show up in the output from the diode of the tuned circuit, and tag communication may degrade. At that point, it will be evident that the antenna is not sensing a tag, but instead is sensing something abnormal. For example, if no voltage is indicated in the tuned circuit, that could indicate that the antenna is not present, or that there is a fault in the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Changes in antenna performance or surrounding load will change the peak rectified voltage from the diode. This changed peak rectified voltage can be compared to historical data or absolute values to detect system faults or performance degradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> An embodiment <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> of an antenna which decreases sensitivity to anomalies is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. A ferrous cover plate or metal sheet <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is positioned a predetermined distance <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> from the back of the antenna <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. The metal sheet or cover <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> serves to magnetically preload the coil <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. This ferric loading of the coil serves to reduce the sensitivity of the antenna <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> to further surrounding metal. The tuned circuit, such as tuned circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, is then tuned with the cover or metal sheet <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> in place. It has been determined that a preferable separation <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> between the antenna <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and the plate or sheet <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is approximately &frac38; of an inch. However, other distances will also serve to preload the tuned circuit. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A method embodiment <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> of tracking the location of identification tags as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> comprises activating a sensing antenna, which is part of a tuned circuit, to excite a passive identification tag in block <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, determining if a voltage is induced in the sensing antenna in block <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, and storing or communicating to the host any induced voltage in the sensing antenna in block <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> if a voltage is induced in the sensing antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> An interrogator such as interrogator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> described in detail above with included multiplexing capability controls multiple antennas all attached to the interrogator, with one antenna being driven at any given time. A detector circuit in the interrogator serves to detect the signals returned from the sensing antenna. The method <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may further comprise activating a plurality of further sensing antennas in a predetermined or random sequence in block <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, followed by the re-execution of blocks <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The sensing antennas and interrogators described in detail above may be used in a tag identification method such as method <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. One or more processors in the interrogator may be used to not only decode data coming back from the detector circuit but also to provide sequential scanning of the ports. Process flow in method <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> allows for either scanning all antenna locations or ports regardless of whether anything is plugged into them. In other words, the sensing antenna, tuned circuit, and detector circuit determine whether an antenna is plugged into a location or not by measuring the voltage generated by the rectification of the tank circuit. This voltage is typically a nominal voltage stable across all antennas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> If no voltage is present in decision block <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, several options for further process flow are available, and will be described in detail below. If no voltage is present, that may indicate that no antenna is present. Alternatively, a lookup table or representation of the configuration of the antenna system may indicate that there should be an antenna at a given location. Further, when a tag powers up, it may not correctly initialize or communicate information. A reinitialization may be necessary. If no voltage is present in block <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, an alarm for an antenna failure or other alarm condition, such as antenna degradation or the like, can be generated. The host system can track antenna voltage and compare historical data to detect problems as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A self-testing embodiment of a material tracking system is a part of the present invention. A self-testing embodiment <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Self-testing embodiment <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> incorporates some of the basic process flow of embodiment <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. Embodiment <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> comprises selecting a scan method from a number of possible scanning methods in block <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, checking an antenna map or the like to allow skipping of inactive antennas in block <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, and activating the selected antenna in block <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. If no antenna is supposed to be present, process flow can continue with the next antenna position. If the antenna voltage for the selected antenna does not exceed a predetermined lower limit as determined by decision block <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, the host is alerted or a local alarm is activated in block <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. If the antenna voltage for the selected antenna is above the predetermined lower limit as determined by decision block <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, process flow continues with block <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, a timeout timer is reset. The timeout timer counts a predetermined time during which the embodiment <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> waits for tag data to be read. The embodiment waits for tag data or the timeout limit of the timeout timer in block <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>. A determination is made as to whether tag data has been detected in decision block <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. If tag data has been detected in block <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, the data is stored or sent to the host in block <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, and the next antenna is selected in block <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>. Following that, process flow continues with block <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> For each instance in which tag data is not detected, an iteration count is compared against an iteration limit in block <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>. A predetermined limit of the number of iterations allowed for detecting tag data is set in the embodiment <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. This number may be set to depend on a number of factors, including the response time of the tags, the required or desired response time of the circuit, and the like. Each unsuccessful detection of tag data results in an incrementing of the iteration count. If no tag data has been detected in block <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, the iteration count is checked against a predetermined iteration limit in decision block <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>. If the iteration count is not above the predetermined limit, the iteration counter is incremented in block <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight>, and the antenna driver is cycled off and back on in block <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight>. Process flow continues with decision block <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. If the iteration count is above the predetermined iteration limit, then &ldquo;no tag&rdquo; data is generated in block <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>, and process flow continues with block <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>. At the selection of the next antenna, the iteration count is reset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Typically, a time period of approximately 50 milliseconds is enough to determine whether a signal will be present. This amounts to approximately two power cycles. If no tag is sensed, the typical scan time is approximately 0.1 seconds for each scan. In a worst case scenario, an entire shelf of 60 antennas with no tags can be scanned in approximately six (6) seconds. The fastest read conditions occur when all active antennas have tags present, and all tags properly power up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Depending upon required response time, the ratio of read points to interrogators could be increased. At 60 to 1, scan time for a shelf is approximately 6 seconds. Increasing the read point to interrogator ratio to 500 to 1 or higher would push scan time to around a minute, which is still acceptable for numerous inventory functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Given the availability of polling a shelf of up to 60 positions in approximately six seconds, any number of possibilities of tracking procedures and other inventory control functions may be implemented in computer software. Currently, bar codes on lots are scanned with the information therefrom being stored in a database. The identification tags are generally molded into a wafer boat or box. Typically, the wafer box remains with the lot for most of the lot life except for a few times, for example, when the boxes are washed, or if the box gets contaminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> of the present invention for tracking the carrier box association to a lot is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. A lot is placed with a box in block <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, and a bar code label is placed on the box in block <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>. The box is associated with the tag in block <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. A database entry is made regarding the association in block <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>. This same database is used to record the sampling information generated at various polling locations around the plant or location in which a system embodiment of the present invention is in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Yet another embodiment <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> of the present invention for associating a tag with material and manufacturer information is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Method <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> comprises scanning, collecting, or entering manufacturer data into a database in block <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, attaching a tag to the raw material in block <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight>, and associating the tag with the manufacturer data in block <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>. The material is moved to storage in block <highlight><bold>1118</bold></highlight>, transported in block <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>, and is moved through a production line in block <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight>. While in any phase of the process <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, apparatus embodiments of the present invention may be used to track the location of the material. The material is transported again in block <highlight><bold>1124</bold></highlight>, and again stored in block <highlight><bold>1126</bold></highlight>. At the completion of the production cycle, the tag is removed in block <highlight><bold>1128</bold></highlight>, and is disposed of or returned for reprogramming in block <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> An identification tag may be attached to an object to be tracked by method embodiment <highlight><bold>1150</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Method <highlight><bold>1150</bold></highlight> comprises forming a shallow polypropylene cup in block <highlight><bold>1152</bold></highlight>, placing the identification tag in the polypropylene cup in block <highlight><bold>1154</bold></highlight>, welding the identification tag to the polypropylene cup ultrasonically in block <highlight><bold>1156</bold></highlight>, and welding the polypropylene cup to the object ultrasonically in block <highlight><bold>1158</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The database generated from all of the association information of the tags and boxes in a particular database can be sampled to generate history information. It is envisioned that such a database will be accessible at multiple locations around a plant or inventory location. The database can be queried to generate the appropriate information. The possibilities are numerous given the present invention embodiments&apos; ability to update information of a box approximately every 6 seconds. Information that could be tracked includes by way of example only, and not by way of limitation, timing a process, timing a transfer time form one location to another, tracking missing lots, tracking movement of lots, detecting when a tag is missing, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Further, the information in the database may be queried, and software written for managing product flow in a production area, scheduling, tracking, notification of arrival and departure, history, spare equipment inventory, and the like. The nearly real-time gathering of information allows vast flexibility limited only by the capabilities of the systems on which the software may be implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The methods shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11, 12</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be implemented in various embodiments in a machine readable medium comprising machine readable instructions for causing a computer <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> such as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> to perform the methods. The computer programs run on the central processing unit <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> out of main memory, and may be transferred to main memory from permanent storage via disk drive <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> when stored on removable media or via a network connection or modem connection when stored outside of the personal computer, or via other types of computer or machine readable medium from which it can be read and utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Such machine readable medium may include software modules and computer programs. The computer programs comprise multiple modules or objects to perform the methods in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11, 12</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, or the functions of various modules in the apparatuses of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 7</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The type of computer programming languages used to write the code may vary between procedural code type languages to object oriented languages. The files or objects need not have a one to one correspondence to the modules or method steps described depending on the desires of the programmer. Further, the method and apparatus may comprise combinations of software, hardware and firmware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The software implementing the various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented by computer programs of machine-executable instructions written in any number of suitable languages and stored on machine or computer readable media such as disk, diskette, RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, or other device commonly included in a personal computer. Firmware can be downloaded by the host into the microcontroller or the auxiliary processor for implementing the embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">ANNUNCIATOR DESIGN </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Given a typical scan time for a shelf of approximately six seconds, a feedback mechanism such as an annunciator, bell, whistle, light, or the like could be used in a circuit such as circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, that could be used to locate a lot or a specific part in a lot location. A representation such as a graphical representation of a shelf, could be employed at a visual display terminal, with the exact location of a certain identified part to be shown on the display, Such representation, due to the close detail allowed by the present invention, would facilitate pinpointing the location of an item or lot for easy retrieval of the part or item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> A coordinate mapping system could be used with graphics on a computer screen, including a number for elevation of a particular shelf in a stack, and a standard position for the shelf, for example an XY scheme with shelf number and position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> An annunciator embodiment <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. A variety of different annunciator type configurations are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. For example, one annunciator embodiment <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> comprises a resistor <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> and a light emitting diode <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> connected in series across the incoming square wave signal. The annunciator embodiment <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> will light the LED <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> when the shelf or lot location to which the annunciator embodiment <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> is connected is polled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Another annunciator embodiment <highlight><bold>1308</bold></highlight> comprises a tuned circuit connected across an incoming square wave, the tuned circuit having a different resonance frequency than the resonance frequency of the tuned circuit used as a sensing antenna. Annunciator embodiment <highlight><bold>1308</bold></highlight> comprises a tuned LC circuit <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight> and an indicator <highlight><bold>1312</bold></highlight>. Indicator <highlight><bold>1312</bold></highlight> will become activated when the shelf or lot location to which the annunciator embodiment <highlight><bold>1308</bold></highlight> is connected is polled with the alternate frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In another annunciator embodiment <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight>, a signaling LED <highlight><bold>1318</bold></highlight> is shown in reverse polarity. In normal operation, suppose that ground is connected to positive, and a bipolar driver sends a drive signal to an antenna. Switching the drive circuit or the ground polarity allows a pulsing reverse bias causing LED <highlight><bold>1318</bold></highlight> to light. In normal connections, with a positive bias on LED <highlight><bold>1318</bold></highlight>, it is not lit. Placing a reverse bias on the annunciator embodiment <highlight><bold>1316</bold></highlight> causes LED <highlight><bold>1318</bold></highlight> to light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, an alphanumeric display <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> is operatively connected across an incoming square wave. The display <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> can derive power from the line, or power can be externally provided. When the line is not used for driving an antenna, the display <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> is recognized by the system, and the display may be used to display tag information such as the tag number, lot number, and the like. Once the tag information is decoded, the path to the host of to the microcontroller could shut off the antenna, and an ASCII signal could be sent on a non-LC frequency.

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Primary application of the embodiments of the present invention are seen in wafer applications. However, multiplexing antennas offers a wide variety of other potential applications such as in large parking lots where RFID tags are placed at front or rear bumpers of vehicles, for example, and antennas are placed at the end of the parking space for identification of location and identity of vehicles. Other uses for the present invention include inventory control systems with large numbers of points to be inventoried but not requiring immediate scanning. Another example is material on a conveyer belt for objects that are momentarily stationary or stationary within approximately a ten second or longer period. Such modifications, variations, and other uses will be apparent to one of skill in the art, and are within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">MANUFACTURE OF THE NESTING STATIONS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Physical implementation of the nesting stations may vary. One implementation is to use a clamshell-type plastic molding with molded ridges, stiffeners and anchor points molded directly into the plastic. The circuit board for the tuned tank includes the capacitors with the connection jacks mounted directly on the circuit board. The circuit board lays in a notch in the top half of the assembly. The metal ground plane plate is placed in the bottom half of the assembly. The antenna coil leads are attached to the circuit board while the antenna coil would be attached to the top half of the molding. A foam filler fills then fills the void and the molding is closed. The assembly of this type is key to keeping the cost low. The configurations allowed by this type of assembly cover very diverse arrangements. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">CONCLUSION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention have added multiplexing circuitry to an interrogator, allowing a single detection circuit and processor to be common to a plurality of antennas. A control module or host is used to control the driving of the antennas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention take advantage of a short range of a sensing antenna to distinguish multiple lots which may be placed very close together in a small area. One interrogator can distinguish many items. The invention has a low cost per read station, which is beneficial due to the large number of read locations. </paragraph>
