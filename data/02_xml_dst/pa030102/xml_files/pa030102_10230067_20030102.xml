<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a substrate processing method, a substrate processing apparatus and a substrate carrying method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a photolithography process in fabrication processes for the semiconductor device, for example, resist coating treatment for forming a resist film on a wafer surface, exposure processing in which a pattern is irradiated on the wafer and exposed, post-exposure baking treatment for heating the wafer after the exposure processing, developing treatment for performing development for the heat-treated wafer and the like are performed in sequence. These processing and treatments are sequentially performed in processing and treatment units separately provided in a single coating and developing treatment system and an aligner adjacent to the system. The coating and developing treatment system is structured to process a plurality of wafers concurrently at the same time, in which normally one carrier carries the wafers between the above-mentioned processing and treatment units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The carrier is configured to freely access the plurality of processing and treatment units and its operation is controlled to carry the wafers in the processing and treatment units at preferable timing in accordance with the processing steps to the processing and treatment units in which the respective following steps are performed, so that a series of the photolithography processing steps is smoothly performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, one carrier carries a number of wafers as described above, and thus in the case where, for example, when the carrier is carrying one wafer in one processing or treatment unit, treatment for another wafer is completed in another processing or treatment unit, the carrier can not carry the other wafer before it finishes carrying the one wafer. Meanwhile, when the carrier is not carrying a wafer but in a waiting state, the carrier can immediately carry the other wafer. Accordingly, the period required after the treatment for a wafer finishes and before the carrier goes to receive the wafer depends on the position and the state of the carrier, presenting a fear that the total periods required from the end of one treatment to the start of the following treatment become nonuniform between the wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When a so-called chemically amplified resist is used as a resist solution for forming the aforementioned resist film, exposure generates acid, and the resist film reacts with the acid and the resist film in the exposed portion changes to be soluble in the developing solution. Therefore, the degree of the developing treatment, that is, the line width of the circuit pattern on the wafer, greatly depends on progress of the chemical reaction by the acid, and the chemical reaction is greatly affected by the period from the exposure to the development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the period after the wafer is subjected to the exposure processing and before the developing treatment, especially, the period required from the exposure processing to the post-exposure baking treatment is affected by the position and the state of the carrier to be nonuniform, presenting a fear of adversely affecting the line of the circuit pattern which is finally formed on the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, the aforementioned carrying of the wafer is conducted as follows, normally a main controller for controlling the carrier receives a processing end signal from each processing or treatment unit and stores it, the carrier recognizes the stored processing end signal every completion of the carrying of one wafer, and the carrier verifies it and then moves to the processing or treatment unit that is the sender to carry the wafer for which predetermined processing has been completed in the processing or treatment unit to the processing or treatment unit where the following step is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described control mechanism for the carrier, however, since the carrier finishes the carrying of the present wafer and verifies processing end signal in the main controller, and then moves to the processing or treatment unit that is the sender, the period after the processing or treatment for the wafer finishes in the processing or treatment unit and before the carrier goes to the processing or treatment unit to receive the wafer differs depending on the state of the carrier at the moment or the number of the processing end signals, and generally tends to be longer. Therefore, it is impossible to carry the wafer between the processing and treatment units speedily and in a fixed period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Especially when the chemically amplified resist solution is used as described above, a treatment is performed in which the acid, as a catalyst, generated in the resist film by the exposure is increased in temperature to activate, promoting the chemical reaction for making the resist film soluble in the developing solution in the post-exposure baking treatment. In the following cooling treatment, a treatment of decreasing the acid in temperature to stop the catalysis of the acid is performed. Therefore, unless the wafer is speedily carried between the post-exposure baking unit and the cooling treatment unit, the wafer is overbaked to cause the chemical reaction to excessively proceed by the catalysis of the acid to widen the width of the resist film soluble in the developing solution, resulting in too wide line width of the circuit pattern which is finally formed on the wafer. Furthermore, if the wafer is not carried between the post-exposure baking unit and the cooling treatment unit in a fixed manner, there is a fear that line widths of the circuit patterns formed on wafers will become nonuniform between the wafers. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to further another aspect, the present invention is a substrate processing apparatus for performing processing for a substrate including a first carrier for carrying the substrate, which has been exposure-processed, to a delivery unit, a second carrier for carrying the substrate staying in the delivery unit to a heat treatment unit where heat treatment before developing treatment is performed, and a controller for controlling the first carrier and the second carrier, wherein the controller conducts a control so that at least when the substrate is carried to the delivery unit, the second carrier is waiting at a predetermined position where the second carrier is capable of receiving the substrate to carry the substrate to the heat treatment unit immediately after the substrate is carried to the delivery unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in order to attain the second object, according to the present invention, in a substrate carrying method of carrying a substrate, which has been heat-treated in a heat treatment unit, by a carrier to a cooling treatment unit where cooling treatment for the substrate is performed, at least when the heat treatment for the substrate is completed, the carrier is waiting at a predetermined position where the carrier is capable of receiving the substrate in the heat treatment unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes the step of carrying the substrate, which has been pre-treated, to a heat treatment unit for heating the substrate, prior to supplying a treatment solution to the substrate to perform solution treatment, wherein the carrying is performed such as to fix a period after the pretreatment for the substrate is completed and before the substrate is carried to the heat treatment unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, since the carrying of the substrate is performed such as to fix the period after the pretreatment for the substrate is completed and before it is carried to the heat treatment unit, for example, the substrate is carried such as to fix the period after the exposure processing that is the pretreatment and before it is carried to the heat treatment unit where heat treatment that is the following treatment, whereby the degrees of the chemical reaction of the coating films by the above-described exposure processing become uniform between substrates. Thus, the developing treatment is performed for the substrates at the same degree, uniformly forming the line widths of the circuit patterns which are finally formed on the substrates between substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> For example, the carrying such as to fix the period after the completion of the exposure processing for the substrate and before it is carried to the heat treatment unit is realized, for example, by controlling the operation of the carrier for carrying the substrate from the aligner to the heat treatment unit. More specifically, it is suggested that, for example, the carrier is kept waiting in front of the aligner in advance to carry the substrate to the heat treatment unit immediately after the exposure is completed and the substrate comes out of the aligner, the carrying of the substrate is always started after a lapse of a fixed period from the completion of the exposure processing, the carrier holding the substrate is suspended at a predetermined place and the suspension period in the event is adjusted, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the present invention, when the exposure processing for the substrate is completed, the first carrier is waiting at the first position where it can receive the substrate to carry the substrate to the delivery unit immediately after the completion of exposure for the substrate. Furthermore, when the substrate is carried to the delivery unit, the second carrier is waiting at the second position where it can receive the substrate to carry the substrate to the heat treatment unit immediately after the substrate is carried to the delivery unit. The first and second carriers wait at the respective predetermined positions preceding to the carrying of other substrates, eliminating the fact that the carriers are, for example, carrying the other substrates or have moved to the positions where they can not immediately receive the substrate, with the result that the carrying period for the substrate from the exposure processing to the heat treatment unit is kept fixed. Accordingly, the above-described chemical reaction of the solubilization in the developing solution uniformly proceeds, whereby the developing treatment is uniformly performed for the substrates, reducing nonuniformity in line width of the finally formed pattern between the substrates. It should be noted that the first carrier and the second carrier are preferably waiting at the respective predetermined positions at least when the exposure is completed and at least when the substrate is carried to the delivery unit respectively, and they may be previously waiting from a predetermined period before. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the carrier is kept waiting from before the completion of the heat treatment at the predetermined position where it can receive the substrate in the heat treatment unit to receive the substrate immediately after the completion of the heat treatment and carry it to the cooling treatment unit. This shortens the period after the completion of the heat treatment and before the substrate is subjected to the cooling treatment and keeps the period fixed. Therefore, overbaking in the heat treatment and nonuniformity in pattern which is finally formed on the substrate between substrates are reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The heat treatment unit gives notice of completion of the heat treatment to the carrier controller, and the carrier controller moves the carrier to the waiting position based on the notice, whereby the carrier can recognize at an earlier time that the heat treatment is immediately before completion, and move to the predetermined position before the completion of the heat treatment and wait there. Therefore, when the heat treatment is completed, the carrier can be waiting at the position where it can access the heat treatment unit and immediately carry the substrate, for which the heating has been completed, to the cooling treatment unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> By giving discrimination marks to the substrates, when the carrier can not be waiting at the predetermined position at the completion of the heat treatment of the substrate, for example, when the carrier can not be waiting by the completion of the heat treatment because the carrier delays in moving to the predetermined position because of the carrying of another substrate, the substrate, which is presumed to be subjected to the heat treatment at the moment and made stand in a state of a high temperature for a period longer than the other substrates, can be recognized as a substrate needing caution based on its discrimination mark. This makes it possible to recognize the substrate of high possibility of being overbaked and remove the substrate needing caution from the other substrates when necessary. Note that the discrimination mark given to the substrate is not limited to one actually provided on the substrate, but it may be an imaginary discrimination mark, for example, a code which is recognized by a controller or the like to result in discrimination of each substrate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the processing unit group <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for example, a cooling unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for performing cooling treatment for the wafer W, an adhesion unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for enhancing adhesion of the resist solution to the wafer W, pre-baking units <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> each for evaporating a solvent in the resist solution are tiered in order from the bottom. In the processing unit group <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, cooling units <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and post-baking units <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> each for performing heat treatment for the developing-treated wafer W tiered in order from the bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the processing unit group <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, cooling units <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and post-exposure baking units (hereinafter, referred to as &ldquo;PEB units&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> as heat treatment units each for performing heat treatment for the wafer W after exposure processing and before developing treatment, are tiered in order from the bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is configured to be movable in a direction of rotation (a &thgr;-direction) and in the Z-direction, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in addition to the above-described Y-direction so as to access and carry the wafer W to the processing and treatment units in the processing station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the cassette station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and extension units <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as delivery units in the interface section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is controlled by a main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> having a carrying algorithm as a program. More specifically, the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is controlled to carry in sequence each wafer W under processing in the processing station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to a processing unit where the following processing is performed in accordance with a predetermined processing flow for the wafer W. The main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> controls the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that when the wafer W for which at least exposure processing has been finished is carried to the above-described extension unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is waiting at a waiting position P, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, as a second position where the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can access the extension unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, that is a position where the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> approaches closest to the extension unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the carrier rail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is provided with a timer function for counting a maximum waiting period M, which is a maximum period during which the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is waiting at the waiting position P. This timer function is for releasing the waiting by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when some trouble occurs in the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and thus the wafer W is not sent out of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The timer function is configured to start counting when the wafer W is carried into the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and stop the counting when the wafer W is carried out of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is configured to be usually waiting at the waiting position P until it receives at the extension unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> the wafer W from the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, but if the wafer W is not sent out of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by the time when the maximum waiting period M which the timer function counts elapses, the waiting by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when it is assumed that a period usually required for an exposure processing step after the wafer W is carried into the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> until it is carried out of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is an exposure processing period T as a predetermined period T, the maximum waiting period M is previously set to be, for example, M&equals;2T, which is sufficiently longer than the exposure processing period T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the extension units <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> each for delivering the wafer W between the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are arranged tiered in order from the bottom on the processing station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> side of the interface section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and on the extension line of the carrier rail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Each of the extension units <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes a mounting table (not shown) for mounting the wafer W thereon and raising and lowering pins (not shown) for raising and lowering the wafer W The extension unit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is used when the wafer W is carried from the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> side, and the extension unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is used when the wafer W is carried from the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> side. On the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> side of the interface section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a carrying-in mounting table <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on which the wafer W is temporarily mounted when the wafer W is carried into the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a carrying-out mounting table <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> on which the wafer W is mounted when the wafer W is carried out of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, are arranged side by side in the X-direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> At the center of the interface section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a rail <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending in the X-direction is provided, on which the above-described carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is provided to freely move. The carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is configured to freely move in the X-direction, the Z-direction, and freely rotate in the &thgr;-direction (a direction of rotation around the Z-axis) so as to access the extension units <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the carrying-in mounting table <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the carrying-out mounting table <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and carry the wafer W to them. The carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is controlled by the main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> similarly to the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that at least when the wafer W, for which exposure processing has been completed, is mounted on the carrying-out mounting table <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is waiting at a waiting position Q, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, as a first position where the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can receive the wafer W on the carrying-out mounting table <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The timer function of the main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is used also for the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, so that the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is configured to wait at the waiting position Q until a period not longer than a maximum waiting period I elapses, but if the wafer W is not sent out of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by the time the maximum waiting period I elapses, the waiting by the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is released. The main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> also controls the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as a carrier unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the maximum waiting period I of the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is set at the same value as the maximum waiting period M of the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Sometimes the exposure processing is not performed in the period as usual because of alignment operation or the like in the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and thus the maximum waiting period I is preferably set at the longest period possible keeping in a consideration nonuniformity in period of the exposure processing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided adjacent to the interface section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with a carrier opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through which the wafer W passes when carried into/out of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a carrier means not shown is provided to carry in the wafer W from the aforesaid carrying-in mounting table <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and carry out the wafer W to the aforesaid carrying-out mounting table <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The carrier opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided with a sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for detecting the wafer W being carried into/out of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and sending the signal to the main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, so that with the signal as a trigger the counting of the timer function in the main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is started or stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Next, the coating and developing treatment method which is carried out in the coating and developing treatment system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> structured as described above is explained along the process of the photolithography processing steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Initially, in the cassette station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> takes one unprocessed wafer W out of the cassette C, and then the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> receives the wafer W direct from the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> carries the wafer W in sequence to the brush scrubber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the wet cleaner <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, where the wafer W is subjected to predetermined cleaning treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the wafer W is carried again by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the adhesion unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> included in the processing unit group <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and coated with an adhesion promoter such as HMDS for enhancing adhesion to the resist solution. Then, the wafer W is carried in sequence by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the cooling unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the resist coating unit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the pre-baking unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the cooling unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to be subjected to predetermined processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The wafer W which has been cooled to a predetermined temperature in the cooling unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is carried by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into the extension unit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and mounted on a mounting table not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Then, the wafer W is carried by the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the carrying-in mounting table <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> near the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, while the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> carries other wafers in the treatment units in the processing station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the treatment units where the respective next steps are performed while moving on the carrier rail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the carrying program of the main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> during a predetermined period E. The predetermined period E here is a period during which the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may carry the other wafers, that is, a predetermined set period shorter than a period which is usually required after the wafer W is mounted on the extension unit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and before the wafer W is sent out of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> After the predetermined period E elapses, the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> moves to the waiting position P where it is accessible to the extension unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and waits there until the wafer W which has been carried into the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is returned to the extension unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the predetermined period E is set, for example, to be the same period as the exposure processing period T so that the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is waiting without fail at the waiting position P when the wafer W for which exposure processing is finished and mounted on the extension unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The wafer W mounted on the carrying-in mounting table <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> by the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is carried through the carrier opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> into the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by the carrier means not shown in the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Hereinafter, the processing for the wafer W relating to the timer function is shown in the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In this event, the sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> at the carrier opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> detects the carrying-in of the wafer W, and sends the signal to the main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. In the main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which has received the signal, the counting by the aforesaid timer function is started taking the signal as a trigger. The carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> moves to the waiting position Q where it is accessible to the carrying-out mounting table <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, and waits there until exposure processing for the wafer W is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a predetermined pattern is exposed on the wafer W in the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. While this exposure processing is performed, the aforesaid predetermined period E of the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> elapses, and the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thus moves to the waiting position P and waits there (becomes the state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Normally, after a lapse of the aforesaid exposure processing period T, the wafer W is sent out from the carrier opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and mounted on the carrying-out mounting table <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. In this event, the sensor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> detects the carrying-out of the wafer W, and sends the signal to the main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, whereby the counting by the timer function of the main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is stopped and reset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The wafer W mounted on the carrying-out mounting table <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is immediately delivered to the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> waiting at the waiting position Q, and the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> carries the wafer W to the extension unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The wafer W carried to the extension unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is immediately delivered to the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> waiting at the waiting position P, and carried to the PEB unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When some trouble happens in the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the wafer W is not sent out of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> even when the maximum waiting period I or M elapses, the timer function is stopped to release the waiting instruction to the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> stops, for example, its operation, and the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> carries the other wafers W remaining in the processing station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for which exposure processing has been properly performed, along the predetermined processing steps described below and stops its operation after the wafers W are carried out of the processing station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the cassette station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The wafer W which has been properly exposed to light and carried to the PEB unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment for promoting solubilization reaction of the resist film in the developing solution. Then, the wafer W is immediately carried to the cooling unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and cooled to a predetermined temperature. Subsequently, the wafer W is carried to the developing treatment unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and subjected to developing treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The wafer W for which the developing treatment has been completed is delivered again to the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and carried backward in the Y-direction on the carrier rail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be delivered to the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the cassette station <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The wafer W is returned to the cassette C by the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and a series of photolithography processing steps is thus completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described embodiment, the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are waiting at the predetermined waiting positions Q and P respectively for the wafer W to come, quickly carrying the wafer W from the exposure processing to the PEB treatment in a fixed period. This equalizes periods required from the exposure processing to the PEB treatment between the wafers W, whereby the solubilization reaction of the resist film to the developing solution uniformly proceeds, and the developing treatment is uniformly performed, resulting in line widths formed on the wafers W uniform between the wafers W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> By providing the timer function in the main controller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to set the maximum waiting periods I and M of the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, when the wafer W is not sent out of the exposure processing because of some reason, the carrying by the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be stopped for a check of the aligner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may carry the other wafers W remaining in the processing station <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for which exposure has been properly performed, to allow them to be subjected to the end of processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the above-described embodiment, both of the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are configured to keep waiting, but it is also preferable that when there occurs no nonuniformity between the wafers W in period required before the carrier or carrier unit receives the wafer W by virtue of the structure of the coating and developing treatment system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the carrying algorithm for the carrier or carrier unit, the carrier or carrier unit without nonuniformity is not kept waiting but the other carrier or carrier unit is kept waiting. More specifically, it is preferable to keep only the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or only the carrier <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> waiting. Also in this case, it is preferable that the timer function is naturally provided ready for the case in which the exposure processing is not performed in the predetermined period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The embodiment explained hereinbefore is for the coating and developing treatment method for the wafer W in the photolithography process in the semiconductor wafer device fabrication processes, and the present invention is applicable to a coating and developing treatment method for a substrate other than the semiconductor wafer, for example, an LCD substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is possible to fix the period from the completion of the exposure processing for the substrate to the start of the heat treatment before the developing treatment, whereby chemical reaction by the exposure to the coating film proceeds to a fixed degree and thus the wafers W are subjected to the developing treatment to a fixed degree, resulting in uniform line width which is finally formed on the substrate between the substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The carrier and carrier unit previously keep waiting to receive the substrate and immediately carry it, thereby also reducing the period required from the completion of the exposure processing to the performance of the heat treatment before the developing treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The maximum waiting periods of the carrier and carrier unit are provided, thereby making it possible to cope also with the case in which the exposure processing is not properly performed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Next, the method of carrying the wafer W which is carried out in the coating and developing treatment system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> structured as described above is explained with the process of the photolithography processing steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Initially, in the cassette station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> takes one unprocessed wafer W out of the cassette C, and then the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> receives the wafer W direct from the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> carries the wafer W in sequence to the brush scrubber <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the wet cleaner <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and further in sequence to the adhesion unit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and the cooling unit <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which are included in the processing unit group <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, whereby the wafer W is subjected to predetermined processing in the processing and treatment units. Then the wafer W is carried by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to the resist coating unit <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to be coated thereon with a chemically amplified resist solution, whereby a resist film is formed on the wafer W. The wafer W on which the resist film formed is then carried again by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in sequence to the pre-baking unit <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the cooling unit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to be subjected to predetermined processing there. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The wafer W which has been cooled to a predetermined temperature in the cooling unit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is carried by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> into the extension unit <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of the interface section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and mounted on the mounting table not shown. Subsequently, the wafer W is carried by the carrier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to the aligner not shown, where a predetermined pattern is exposed on the wafer W. In this event, acid, which acts as a catalyst for solubilization reaction of the resist film in the developing solution, generates in the resist film in the exposed portion. The wafer W for which exposure processing has been completed is carried again by the main carrier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to the extension unit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, and then carried by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> into the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> through the carrier opening <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The following wafer processing is explained along the flow chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The wafer W is initially heated at a predetermine temperature in the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, whereby the acid in the resist film is activated to proceed the solubilization reaction of the resist film in the exposed part to the developing solution. Then, when it is a predetermined period T before the completion of the heat treatment, the controller <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>sends a dummy end signal of giving notice that it is immediately before the completion of the heat treatment, to the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> which has received the aforesaid dummy end signal immediately verifies whether or not the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is keeping another wafer W. When the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is not keeping another wafer W, the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> instructs the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to move to the predetermined position P where it can receive the wafer W in the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, that is, a position in front of the shutter <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. The main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> which has received the instruction moves on the carrier rail <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the predetermined position P as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and waits there until the shutter <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at the carrier opening <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, when the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is keeping another wafer W, the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> stores therein the dummy end signal and always verifies whether or not the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is keeping the other wafer W, and gives a moving instruction to the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to move to the predetermined position P when the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> completes the carrying operation of the other wafer W and becomes a so-called free state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, when the heat treatment in the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is completed and the shutter <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is opened, the waiting main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> immediately carries the wafer W out of the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> to the cooling unit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The wafer W which has been carried to the cooling unit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is cooled to a predetermined temperature, whereby the catalysis of the acid then stops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the wafer W is carried by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to the developing treatment unit <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to be subjected to developing treatment. The wafer W for which the developing treatment has been completed is carried again by the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in sequence to post-baking unit <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> and the cooling unit <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. The wafer W for which the cooling treatment has been completed is carried backward in the Y-direction on the carrier rail <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and delivered to the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in the cassette station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The wafer W is returned to the cassette C by the wafer carrier <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and a series of photolithography processing steps is thus completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the above-described second embodiment, the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> previously sends the dummy end signal to the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> moves by the instruction from the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, which has received the dummy end signal, to the predetermined position P in front of the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> and waits there until the PEB treatment is completed, so that the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> can receive the wafer W immediately after the PEB treatment for the wafer W is completed and the shutter <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is opened, and carry it to the cooling unit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. This avoids the wafer W, for which the PEB treatment has completed, from being waiting in the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> for the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to come to receive it, whereby the period required from the PEB treatment to the cooling treatment is reduced and kept fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Further, before the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> which has received the dummy end signal gives a moving instruction to the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> verifies whether or not the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is carrying another wafer W, and when it is carrying, the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> gives the moving instruction immediately after the completion of the carrying, thereby making it possible to properly cope with the case where the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> can not move to the predetermined position P because of the carrying of the other wafer W. Furthermore, as compared with the conventional case in which after the PEB treatment for the wafer W is completed, the end signal is sent to the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and thereafter the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> verifies the end signal and then moves to the predetermined position P, the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> can move earlier to the predetermined position P where it can receive the wafer W, and thus the period required from the PEB treatment to the cooling treatment is reduced and kept fixed also in this case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The above-described embodiment is the case in which the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> has moved to the predetermine position P where it can access the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> without fail before the completion of the PEB treatment. However, it is predictable that it takes a long time for the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to carry another wafer W to be late for the time at the completion of the PEB treatment. As measures in this case, it is suggested that the overbaked wafer W is separated from the properly processed wafers W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> For example, imaginary numbers are previously given as discrimination marks to the wafers W, and previously recognized by, for example, the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. When the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is late for the time at the completion of the PEB treatment, the main controller <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> recognizes the number of the wafer under processing at that time as a wafer needing caution. Thereafter, the wafer needing caution is processed in accordance with the predetermined processing flow, and when it is carried to the cassette C in the cassette station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, it is separated and mounted, for example, in a cassette C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is previously provided for a wafer needing caution as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. This makes it possible to separate the overbaked wafer W and the normally PEB-processed wafers W, thereby removing a wafer W of a poor quality from products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the wafer W overbaked in the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> may be carried, not subjected to the following processing, immediately to the cassette station <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be carried into the cassette C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the wafer W needing caution. In this case, the developing treatment and the like are not performed yet, making it possible to use again the wafer W by removing the resist film thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Note that the predetermined period T of the controller <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is preferably set to be somewhat long enough to prevent the main carrier unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> from not usually being late for the completion of the PEB treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The method of carrying the wafer W according to the above-described embodiment is for the carrying from the PEB unit <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> to the cooling unit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, and it is also applicable to the carrying between another heat treatment unit and cooling treatment unit, for example, between the pre-baking unit <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the cooling unit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and between the post-baking unit <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> and the cooling unit <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the above-described embodiment is for the method of carrying the wafer W in the photolithography process in the semiconductor wafer device fabrication processes, and the present invention is applicable to a method of carrying a substrate other than the semiconductor wafer, for example, an LCD substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the carrier unit for the substrate keeps waiting from before the completion of the heat treatment for the substrate at the position where it can receive the substrate in the heat treatment unit in which the heat treatment is performing, to immediately carry the substrate, for which the heat treatment has been completed, to the cooling treatment unit, whereby the period required from the heat treatment to the cooling treatment is reduced and kept fixed. Consequently, overbaking or difference in thermal history between substrates is reduced to form a predetermined pattern on the substrate, resulting in improved yields. </paragraph>
