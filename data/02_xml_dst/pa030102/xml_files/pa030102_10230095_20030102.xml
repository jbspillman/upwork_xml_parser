<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As a conventional technique, for example, there is a technique disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (JP-A-Heisei, 7-147287). That is, this is a SiGe base bipolar transistor, in which each of a base layer and a collector layer are constituted by a single crystal silicon layer containing germanium (Element Symbol: Ge), and an occurrence of a parasitic energy barrier is protected in a base-collector junction region, and a drop in a cut-off frequency is suppressed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the conventional SiGe base bipolar transistor, the N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type buried layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> having a high concentration and the first collector layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>A having a first Ge concentration distribution and the second collector layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>B having a second Ge concentration distribution are formed on the P-type silicon substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> resulting from a selectively epitaxial growth and the emitter layer <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> constituted by an N-type diffusion layer are formed on the first collector layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a graph showing the profile of a Ge percentage content (germanium percent content) and an impurity concentration with respect to a depth of the conventional SiGe base bipolar transistor. In the conventional SiGe base bipolar transistor, the first collector layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>A having the first Ge concentration distribution and the second collector layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>B having the second Ge concentration distribution (germanium concentration distribution) are formed in the N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type buried layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> having the high concentration in which N-type impurity is doped at about 10<highlight><superscript>20 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Then, the P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in which P-type impurity is doped at about 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>and the poly-crystal silicon film <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to pull out an emitter in which the N-type impurity is doped at about 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>20 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>are formed on the first collector layer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>A. The emitter layer <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is formed by using the impurity thermal diffusion from the poly-crystal silicon film <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to pull out an emitter in which the N-type impurity is doped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> With regard to the Ge concentration distribution of the P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, in the P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, an emitter region side has a low distribution, and a collector region side has a high distribution. That is, the emitter region side has a Ge percentage content of 0%, and the collector region side has a slant concentration distribution having a percentage content of 10%. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an energy band structure at this time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a graph showing an energy band at the slant Ge profile (slant germanium profile). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in the case of the conventional SiGe base bipolar transistor, in the P-type crystal SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, an inclination can be set for a conductive band side of an energy band, correspondingly to a Ge composition ratio (germanium composition ratio). Thus, an electron implanted from an emitter is accelerated in the P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> by an electrical field caused by the slant energy band structure. Hence, it is possible to reduce a base transit time of the electron and accordingly improve a cut-off frequency f<highlight><smallcaps>T</smallcaps></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, in the case of the conventional SiGe base bipolar transistor, in order to make the cut-off frequency f<highlight><smallcaps>T </smallcaps></highlight>higher by using the slant Ge profile, it is necessary to reduce a thickness of the P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. For example, it is noted that the thickness of the P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is about 90 nm and the cut-off frequency f<highlight><smallcaps>T</smallcaps></highlight>&equals;20 GHz. In order to set the cut-off frequency f<highlight><smallcaps>T </smallcaps></highlight>to 60 GHz, the thickness of the P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> must be reduced to about 30 nm. This brings about the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As the first problem, a constant region is narrow because of a drop in a current gain h<highlight><smallcaps>FE </smallcaps></highlight>in a high current region when the slant Ge profile is used, although an analog circuit especially requires that a current gain h<highlight><smallcaps>FE </smallcaps></highlight>(&equals;collector current/base current) is constant in a wide current region of a collector current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The reason is as follows. In the profile that the impurity concentration in the base is constant and the Ge concentration is slant such as the slant Ge profile, a collector current density Jc is represented by the following equation (1):

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the case of the slant Ge profile of the conventional SiGe base bipolar transistor, when the thickness of the P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is reduced, this reduction causes the Ge inclinations (germanium inclinations) to be sharp at the positions of the formations of the emitter-base junction and the depletion layer between the emitter and the base. This results in a large reduction in a contraction amount <highlight><superscript>&Dgr;</superscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>g,Ge</subscript></highlight>(0) of a band gap when the depletion layer between the emitter and the base is contracted as a voltage between the emitter and the base is made higher. Thus, the collector current is dropped in accordance with the equation (1), and the current gain h<highlight><smallcaps>FE </smallcaps></highlight>is largely dropped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The second problem is the occurrence of a large variation in a collector current flowing when a certain voltage is applied between the base and the emitter. The variation in the collector current has great influence on a circuit operation when a transistor is used as a constant current source, for example, such as a case of an ECL circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The reason of the variation in this collector current is as follows. The emitter layer <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is formed by using the impurity thermal diffusion from the poly-crystal silicon film <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to pull out an emitter in which the N-type impurity is doped. The reduction in the thickness of the P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> causes the Ge inclination (germanium inclination) to be sharp at the position where the emitter-base junction is formed. As a result, the slight variation at the junction position leads to the difference of the contraction amount <highlight><superscript>&Dgr;</superscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>g,Ge</subscript></highlight>(0) in the band gap. That is, the collector current is proportional to the contraction amount <highlight><superscript>&Dgr;</superscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>g,Ge</subscript></highlight>(0) in the band gap as an exponential function, which brings about the large variation in the collector current. </paragraph>

In this embodiment, the N-type collector layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> having the low concentration in which the N-type impurity is doped at about 10<highlight><superscript>16 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>is formed on the N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type buried layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having the high concentration in which the N-type impurity is doped at about 10<highlight><superscript>20 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>. Then, the undoped SiGe layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> having a Ge concentration of about 10% and a thickness of about 30 nm, the first SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A having the first Ge concentration distribution, and the second SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B having the second Ge concentration distribution are formed on the N-type collector layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> having the low concentration.

The emitter layer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is formed by using the impurity thermal diffusion from the poly-crystal silicon film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to pull out the emitter in which the N-type impurity is doped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The undoped SiGe layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is formed in order to protect a parasitic energy barrier from being induced in a base-collector junction. By the way, as described in the conventional technique disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (JP-A-Heisei, 7-147287), the Ge distribution in the collector layer may be designed so as to be sharply reduced on the side of a P-type SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and slowly reduced on the side of an N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type buried layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of a semiconductor manufacturing method in the present invention will be described below. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this is designed such that a thickness of the second SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B is set at about 20 nm, and a Ge concentration is increased from about 0% to about 2% in the emitter region side of the second SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B. And, this is designed such that a thickness of the first SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A is set at about 10 nm, and a Ge concentration is increased from about 2% to about 10% in the first SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the second SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B in which an emitter-base junction and a depletion layer are formed, a Ge inclination (germanium inclination) can be set at about 0.1%/nm. Hence, a variation amount of a band gap in the depletion layer becomes at an untroubled level, at a time of an increase in a base-emitter voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the total Ge concentration inclination resulting from the first SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A and the second SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B is about 10%. Thus, the total of electric fields caused by slant energy band structure can be set to be equal to that of the case when the conventional Ge concentration has a constant inclination. As a result, this provides the effect that the influence on a cut-off frequency f<highlight><smallcaps>T </smallcaps></highlight>can be kept to a minimum. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the conventional technique, as the collector current density Jc is higher, the current gain h<highlight><smallcaps>FE </smallcaps></highlight>is outstandingly dropped. On the contrary, in this embodiment, the problem of the drop in the current gain h<highlight><smallcaps>FE </smallcaps></highlight>is improved as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Actually in this embodiment, the range of the collector current density Jc, in which the current gain h<highlight><smallcaps>FE </smallcaps></highlight>is within about 80% with respect to the maximum, can be enlarged by about 20% as compared with that of the conventional technique. Also, the variation in the collector current density Jc can be improved by about 30%. </paragraph>

Then, the undoped SiGe layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> having a Ge concentration of about 10% and a thickness of about 30 nm, the third SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>A having a third Ge concentration distribution, the fourth SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>B having a fourth Ge concentration distribution, and the Si base layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>C are formed on the N-type collector layer <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> having the low concentration.

Moreover, the poly-crystal silicon film <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> to pull out an emitter in which the N-type impurity is doped at about 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>20 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>is formed on the Si base layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>C. The emitter layer <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> is formed by using the impurity thermal diffusion from the poly-crystal silicon film <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> to pull out the emitter in which the N-type impurity is doped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in this embodiment, the thickness of the Si base layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>C is set at about 20 nm. Then, the thickness of the fourth SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>B is set at about 5 nm, and the Ge concentration is designed so as to be increased from about 0% to about 2% on the emitter region side in the fourth SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>B. Then, the thickness of the third SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>A is set at about 5 nm, and the Ge concentration is designed so as to be increased from about 2% to about 10% in the third SiGe base layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the emitter-base junction and its depletion layer are formed in the Si base layer.
