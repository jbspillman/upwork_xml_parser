<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device and, more particularly, to a dynamic semiconductor memory device having information stored in the form of charges in a capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A system LSI (Large-Scale Integrated circuit) is an integrated circuit device in which a logic and a memory are integrated on a single die (chip) to form a system. In the system LSI, memories such as an SRAM (Static Random Access Memory), a DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), and a flash EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM) are used according to application purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Since an SRAM statically operates and therefore operates at high speed, it is generally used for high speed processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a DRAM, a memory cell is constructed by one transistor and one capacitor, so that the layout area of a memory cell is small. The DRAM is therefore generally used for a large storage capacity application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A flash EEPROM can store information in a nonvolatile manner and is generally used in an application requiring to store information even when the power is shut down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In an SRAM, a memory cell is constructed by a flip flop. When a power voltage is lowered for lower power consumption and higher processing speed, the threshold voltage of an MOS transistor (insulated gate field effect transistor) used for a memory cell has to be lowered in absolute value, so that a sub-threshold leak current increases. Consequently, a leak current in a standby mode becomes large, and the specification condition of a small current consumption in the standby mode, which is required for a portable equipment or the like cannot be satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a DRAM, operating conditions required for a memory array section and those for a peripheral circuit section are different from each other. Usually, the level of a power source voltage in the memory array section and that in the peripheral circuit section are different from each other. The memory array section requires voltages of different levels, such as a power source voltage (sense power source voltage) supplied to a sense amplifier for sensing and amplifying memory cell data, a negative substrate bias voltage for biasing the substrate region of a memory array, a high voltage transmitted onto a selected word line to prevent a loss by a threshold voltage of an access transistor, and an intermediate voltage for precharging a bit line. The voltages of different levels have to be internally generated, so that the current is additionally consumed to generate those internal voltages. A problem of large current consumption arises. For example, in the case of generating a high voltage through a charge pumping operation, the pump efficiency is lower than 1. In order to generate a high voltage of a necessary level, a current larger than a current consumed by a circuit using the high voltage has to be consumed to generate the high voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Besides, the DRAM has to perform a refreshing operation of periodically restoring stored data. In the standby mode in a portable equipment or the like requiring ultra-low current consumption, therefore, a refresh current is consumed, and the specification of the ultra-low current consumption cannot be satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> There is a problem such that current consumption in the DRAM is large, and a specification value of a low current consumption required for a portable equipment or the like cannot be sufficiently achieved. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor memory device achieving low current consumption in a standby mode without exerting an adverse influence on access operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor memory device consuming a small current in the standby mode, suited for a system LSI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor memory device according to the invention includes: a plurality of memory cells arranged in a matrix of rows and columns; a plurality of bit lines, arranged in correspondence to the columns of the memory cells, each having the memory cells in a corresponding column connected; a plurality of word lines, arranged in correspondence to rows of the memory cells, each having the memory cells in a corresponding row connected; a plurality of first sense amplifiers each disposed in correspondence to a set of a predetermined number of bit lines, for sensing and amplifying data of the memory cells in the corresponding column when activated; a plurality of first transfer gates each disposed in correspondence to each of the bit lines, for connecting a corresponding bit line and the first sense amplifier when made conductive; and connection control circuitry for selectively making the plurality of first transfer gates conductive in response to an operation mode instruction signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> By switching connection between a bit line and a sense amplifier according to an operation mode, the data storing form can be switch between a one-bit-per-cell (1 bit/cell) mode and a one-bit-per-two-cells (1 bit/2 cells) mode. In the case of storing data in the one-bit-per-cell mode, the device can operate in a manner similar to a normal DRAM. In the case of the one-bit-per-two-cells mode, complementary data is read onto a pair of bit lines. Consequently, a read voltage sensed and amplified by a sense amplifier is made large. Even when charges flow out from a memory cell capacitor due to a leak current, data can be satisfactory sensed and amplified, and a refresh interval can be made longer. Therefore, by using the one-bit-per-two-cells mode in the standby mode, the current amount consumed for the refreshing operation in the standby mode can be reduced. Thus, the current in the standby mode can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram schematically showing the configuration of a whole semiconductor integrated circuit device containing a semiconductor memory device according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> semiconductor integrated circuit device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for processing data, a DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> serving as a main storage for the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and an SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for storing program instructions and/or data for the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A logic power source voltage EVL is applied to the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the logic power source voltage EVL and a DRAM power source voltage EVD are applied to the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and an SRAM power source voltage EVS is applied to the SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor integrated circuit device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a system LSI, the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of memory devices, and the SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a high-speed memory device of a small storage capacity and a low power consumption memory device of a small storage capacity depending on its application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The logic power source voltage EVL is a voltage lower than the DRAM power source voltage EVD. The logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a MOS transistor of a low threshold voltage as a component and operates at high speed. In the SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the low power consumption memory device has a high threshold voltage MOS transistor used for a memory cell of the memory device and has a small leak current in the standby mode. In the SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a high speed memory unit has a low threshold voltage MOS transistor used for a memory cell for high speed operation and has a large leak current in the standby mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> receives the logic power source voltage EVL and the DRAM power source voltage EVD as operation power source voltages, and adjusts the level of a voltage generated internally in accordance with an operation mode, thereby reducing the current consumption and achieving high speed operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram schematically showing the configuration of the whole DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a plurality of memory cells MC arranged in a matrix of rows and columns. The memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with word lines WL disposed in correspondence to rows of the memory cells MC and bit lines BL arranged in correspondence to columns of the memory cells MC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> further includes: a row selecting circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for driving a word line corresponding to an addressed row in the memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into a selected state; a sense amplifier group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a plurality of sense amplifiers for sensing and amplifying data in memory cells read out onto the bit lines BL; a precharging circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for precharging a bit line BL to a predetermined voltage level in the standby mode; and a column related circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for selecting an addressed column in the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and accessing data (writing/reading data) in a data access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a predetermined layout pattern satisfying, at the minimum, the condition that the memory cells MC are disposed every other column in the row direction is repeated in the row and column directions. The memory cell MC includes one transistor and one capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> further includes: a VPP generating circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for generating a high voltage VPP from the DRAM power source voltage EVD through, for example, a charge pumping operation; a switching circuit (MUX) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for selecting one of the logic power source voltage EVL and the high voltage VPP in accordance with a control signal &phgr;A and applying the selected one as a word line driving voltage to the row selecting circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>; a VBL generating circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for generating an intermediate voltage VBL from the DRAM power source voltage EVD; a switching circuit (MUX) <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for selecting one of the logic power source voltage EVL and the intermediate voltage VBL in accordance with the control signal &phgr;A and applying the selected one to the precharging circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>; a sense power source circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for generating a sense power source voltage VCCA by down converting the DRAM power source voltage EVD for application to the sense amplifier group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; a switch circuit (SW) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for interrupting transmission of the DRAM power source voltage EVD to the column related circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in accordance with a control signal &phgr;B; and a mode setting circuit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for setting a connection manner between a sense amplifier included in the sense amplifier group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a bit line BL in accordance with the control signal &phgr;A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The high voltage VPP is at a voltage level higher than that of the sense power source voltage VCCA, and a voltage VWL selected by the switching circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is transmitted to a selected word line in the memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The intermediate voltage VBL is, generally, at a voltage level of half the sense power source voltage VCCA, and is transmitted to the bit line BL via the precharging circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the standby mode. The intermediate voltage VBL may also be applied to a cell plate of a memory cell capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The mode setting circuit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> switches the connection between a sense amplifier included in the sense amplifier group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a corresponding bit line BL as follows. The DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> operates in a one-bit-per-cell mode (single cell mode) of storing information of one bit by one memory cell MC and a one-bit-per-two-cells mode (twin cell mode) of storing information of one bit by two memory cells (memory unit). In the single cell mode, the bit lines are selected to be connected to a corresponding sense amplifier such that in a pair of bit lines BL connected to a sense amplifier, memory cell data is read out to one of the bit lines, and the other bit line is maintained at the precharged voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the twin cell mode, the pairs of bit lines are selected to corresponding sense amplifiers such that memory cells are connected to both the bit lines of a bit line pair connected to the corresponding sense amplifier. Specifically, complementary data are stored in the memory unit and are transmitted to the pair of bit lines connected to the sense amplifier. In the twin cell mode, only the sense amplifier corresponding to the bit lines to which the memory cells are connected is activated. Since the memory cells MC are arranged every other column in the row direction, the number of sense amplifiers which are made active in the twin cell mode is halved, thereby reducing a bit line charging/discharging current and reducing the current consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the twin cell mode, since complementary data are stored in the memory unit, the complementary data are transmitted to a pair of bit lines. A read voltage transmitted to the sense amplifier therefore increases, a refresh interval can be made longer, and the current consumption in the standby mode can be reduced. In the case of performing sense operation with the read voltage similar to conventional one, the sense start timing can be advanced. Thus, high speed access is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> When the control signal &phgr;B is made active, the switch circuit (SW) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> interrupts the DRAM power source voltage EVD to be supplied to the column related circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to stop the operation of the column related circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for reducing the leak current in the column related circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the consumption current. The operations of the circuits in accordance with the operation modes will be briefly described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> 1. Normal Operation Mode: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the normal operation mode, as described above, the logic power source voltage EVL is externally applied to the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the external DRAM power source voltage EVD is applied to the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the external SRAM power source voltage EVS is applied to the SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this state, the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> operate according to inherent intended purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the normal operation, the VPP generating circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and VBL generating circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> generate the high voltage VPP and the intermediate voltage VBL, respectively, from the DRAM power source voltage EVD. The switching circuits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> select the high voltage VPP and the intermediate voltage VBL, respectively. In the memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, therefore, the high voltage VPP is transmitted onto a selected word line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The mode setting circuit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> establishes the connection between a sense amplifier included in the sense amplifier group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a bit line BL so as to operate in the single cell mode. The bit line BL is precharged and equalized to the intermediate voltage VBL level. The column related circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> operates using the DRAM source voltage EVD as an operation power source voltage received via the switch circuit (SW) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The sense power source circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> generates the sense power source voltage VCCA from the DRAM power source voltage EVD through a voltage down converting operation. An H level of data stored in the memory cell MC is therefore equal to the voltage level of the sense power source voltage VCCA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> 2. DRAM Low Current Consumption Mode: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the case of reducing the current consumption in an operation of the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, for example, in the standby mode, a data retaining mode, or the like, the mode setting circuit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> sets the connection between a sense amplifier included in the sense amplifier group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a bit line BL so as to implement the twin cell mode. In this case, the number of memory cells to be connected to a word line WL selected by the row selecting circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is the same as that in the normal operation mode, that is, in the single cell mode. It is, however, unnecessary to charge/discharge a reference bit line in a precharged state, so that only the sense amplifier to which the memory unit is connected is made active. Consequently, the number of sense amplifiers to be activated is reduced to the half of that in the normal operation mode, thereby reducing the bit line charging/discharging current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> According to the control signal &phgr;A, the logic power source voltage EVL is selected by the switching circuits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and applied to the row selecting circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the precharging circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The logic power source voltage EVL is therefore transmitted to a selected word line, and the bit lines BL in the standby mode are precharged and equalized to the level of the logic power source voltage EVL. The voltage level of the logic power source voltage EVL is lower than that of the sense power source voltage VCCA. The sense power source voltage VCCA from the sense power source circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is supplied to the sense amplifier group <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Since the logic power source voltage EVL is used in place of the high voltage VPP and the intermediate voltage VBL, an extra current consumption required to compensate for the current when the high voltage VBP and the intermediate voltage VBL are consumed can be reduced, and the current consumption can be reduced. The voltage generating operation of the VPP generating circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the VBL generating circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is stopped in the DRAM low current consumption mode in response to the control signal &phgr;A, thereby reducing unnecessary current consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> 3. Ultra-Low Standby Current Mode: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the case of continuing a standby mode for a long time, as in a sleep mode, in order to reduce the leak current in the SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> while retaining data in the high speed memory device in the SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the data to be retained in the SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is transferred to the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the SRAM <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is powered off. Supply of the SRAM power source voltage EVS is interrupted, which is easily achieved by a switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the switch circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is made non-conductive by the control signal &phgr;B and the supply of the DRAM power source voltage EVD to the column related circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is stopped. In the ultra low standby current mode, the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is set in the self refresh mode, and the power source voltage is supplied only to circuits necessary for the refreshing operation. The state similar to that in the DRAM low current consumption mode is established in the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. By using the logic power source voltage EVL as a peripheral power source voltage, the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> operates in the twin cell mode and refreshes memory cell data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The control signals &phgr;A and &phgr;B may be supplied from the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or generated in the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> under the control of the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Specific configurations of parts in the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a diagram more specifically showing the configurations of the memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and peripheral circuitry of the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is divided into a plurality of bank memory arrays <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The bank memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided for each of banks BK<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BKm. Each of the banks BK<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BKm includes a row decoding circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for selecting a row and a column decoding circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for selecting a column. Each of the banks BK<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BKm can, independently of others, make memory cell row selection active or inactive. The row decoding circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is included in the row selecting circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and the column decoding circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is included in the column related circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> further includes: a clock buffer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for receiving complementary clock signals CLK and /CLK supplied from the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and generating complementary internal clock signals CLKi and /CLKi; and input buffers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>for receiving a command CMD, an active bank address signal ABA, a precharge bank address signal PBA, a write bank address signal WBA, a read bank address signal RBA, an activate address signal ACA, a read address signal RDA, and a write address signal WRA, respectively, which are supplied from the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The clock buffer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> detects an edge (intersection point) of the complementary clock signals CLK and /CLK from the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and generates the complementary internal clock signals CLKi and /CLKi each having rising and falling edges synchronized with the detected edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Each of the input buffers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>determines the level (H or L) of a supplied signal on the basis of a reference voltage Vref received from the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The command CMD is a signal for designating an operation mode. When a clock enable signal CKE is active, the input buffer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>determines the command CMD being a valid command, takes in the command CMD, and generates an internal command. The active bank address signal ABA specifies a bank to be activated out of the banks BK<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BKm. The precharge bank address signal PBA specifies a bank to be precharged out of the banks BK<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BKm. The bank specified by the precharge bank address signal PBA sent together with a precharge command returns back to a precharged state under the control of control circuitry (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The write bank address signal WBA specifies a bank to which data is written. The read bank address signal RBA specifies a bank from which data is read. The write bank address signal WBA and the read bank address signal RBA are provided for the reason that, as will be described later, a data write path and a data read path are provided separately from each other. These bank address signals are supplied together with corresponding commands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The active address signal ACA specifies an address of a word line to be selected in the bank memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The read address signal RDA specifies a column from which data is read in a bank specified by the read bank address signal RBA. The write address signal WRA specifies a column to which data is written in a bank specified by the write bank address signal WBA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The DRAM <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> further includes: a mode decoder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for generating an internal operation mode instruction signal &phgr;CTL in accordance with an internal command from the input buffer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>; latches <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>provided in correspondence to the input buffers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, for latching signals applied from the input buffers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, respectively, synchronously with an internal clock signal; a refresh timer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for issuing a refresh request at predetermined intervals in response to a self refresh mode instruction signal &phgr;SR from the mode decoder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>; a refresh counter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for performing counting operation in response to the output signal of the refresh timer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and generating a refresh address signal for specifying a row to be refreshed; a selecting circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for selecting either an output count value of the refresh counter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> or an active address signal from the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>; a predecoding circuit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for predecoding an output signal from the selecting circuit <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and supplying a resultant signal to the row decoding circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the banks BK<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BKm; a predecoding circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for predecoding the read address signal RDA from the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and supplying a resultant signal to the column decoding circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the banks BK<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BKm; and a predecoding circuit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for predecoding the write address signal WRA from the latch <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>and supplying a resultant signal to the column decoding circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the banks BK<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BKm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The row decoding circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is made active when the activate bank address signal ABA designates a corresponding bank, decodes the predecoded signal from the predecoding circuit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and drives a word line corresponding to the addressed row in the corresponding bank memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into a selected state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The column decoding circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes a column decoder for writing and a column decoder for reading. In a data reading mode, the column decoder for reading in the column decoding circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a bank specified by the read bank address signal RBA is activated to decode a read predecoded signal from the predecoding circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In a data writing mode, the column decoder for writing in the column decoding circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a bank specified by the write bank address signal WBA is activated to decode a write predecoded signal from the predecoding circuit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and selects a write column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In a self refresh mode, refresh is performed according to a count value from the refresh counter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. In the self refresh mode, refresh may be performed simultaneously in the banks BA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BKm or on a bank basis. When the refresh is executed on the bank basis, a count value of the refresh counter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is decoded to generate a refresh bank address signal. The bank address signal is decoded and then sent by the logic <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The bank address signal is equivalent to a bank designation signal for designating a corresponding bank at the time of activation thereof. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> (1) Single Cell Mode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> First, the operation in the single cell mode will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in the standby mode, all of the complementary sub decode signals ZSDO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to ZSDO<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and ZSDE<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to ZSDE<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are at the H level, and all of the sub decode signals SDO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to SDO<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and SDE<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to SDE<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are at the L level. Therefore, the resetting MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is ON in the sub word driver SWD, and the sub word lines SWL (SWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to SWL<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) are maintained at the ground voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> When an active cycle for selecting a memory cell row starts, first, the bank selection signal BA is driven to a selected state in response to the active bank address signal ABA. The bank selection signal BA is at a power source voltage (periphery power source voltage) Vcc level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the active address signal is decoded in the selected bank, and a selected main word line MWL is driven to the power source voltage Vcc level. In the sub word driver SWD, the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on in response to the bank selection signal BA, and the internal node NA is connected to the corresponding main word line MWL. In the sub word driver SWD connected to the selected main word line MWL, the internal node NA increases in voltage level to the level of a voltage of Vcc&minus;Vth, where Vth denotes a threshold voltage of the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the sub word driver SWD provided corresponding to a non-selected main word line, the internal node NA is maintained at the ground voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Then, the selected sub decode signal SD (SDO or SDE) is driven at the high voltage VPP level, and the level of the selected sub decode signal ZSD (SD) is lowered from the H level to the L level. In the sub word driver SWD, the voltage level of the internal node NA increases to a voltage level Vcc&minus;Vth&plus;VPP through a self boost operation. Accordingly, the sub decode signal SD at the high voltage VPP level is transmitted to the selected sub word line SWL. In the self boost operation, even if the bank selection signal BA is at the H level, or in the selected state, the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is in the OFF state and functions as a decoupling transistor, when the high voltage VPP is transmitted to the selected sub word line from the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the voltage on the gate and that on the drain in the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> become the same and are lower than the power source potential, so that MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> maintains the OFF state. In the sub word driver SWD arranged corresponding to the selected sub word line, the node NA maintains the potential level of the voltage Vcc&minus;Vth&plus;VPP. According to the sub decode signal, the selected sub word line SWL is maintained at the high voltage VPP level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> For the non-selected sub word driver SWD connected to the selected main word line, even if the node NA is at the H level, the corresponding sub decode signal SD is at the L level, the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is in the OFF state, the ground voltage is transmitted via the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the corresponding sub word line SWL, the corresponding resetting transistor Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> maintains the ON state, and the non-selected sub word line maintains the ground potential level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In the sub word driver connected to a non-selected main word line, even when the corresponding sub decode signal SD is driven to the high voltage VPP level, the node NA is kept at the ground voltage level, and the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on, and the self boost operation of the node NA is inhibited. Consequently, the non-selected sub word line is fixed at the ground voltage level by the resetting MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> For the sub word driver SWD connected to the non-selected main word line, when the corresponding sub decode signal SD is at the L level of the ground voltage level, both of the MOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are turned off. In this state, the corresponding resetting MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is in the ON state, so that the corresponding sub word line does not enter an electrically floating state, but is held at the ground voltage level by the resetting MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In the self boost operation, the decoupling function of the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the sub word driver SWD is utilized. The bank selection signal BA may be activated in the form of a one-shot pulse. In this case, it is unnecessary to hold the main word line MWL to the H level during the active period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In return to the precharge state, the resetting MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned on, and the sub decode signal SD in the selected state is lowered to the L level, thereby resetting the node NA at the high voltage level to the ground voltage level via the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> (2) Twin Cell Mode Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The operation in the twin cell mode will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in an operation in the twin cell mode, in place of the high voltage VPP, the logic power source voltage EVL (Vccl) is used. As the precharging voltage for the bit line, similarly, the logic power source voltage EVL is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in the twin cell mode as well, at the time of selection, the bank selection signal BA is driven to power source voltage Vcc (DRAM power source voltage (EVD level)). Subsequently, a selected main word line MWL is also driven to the power source voltage Vcc level. In the selected sub word driver SWD, the voltage level of the node NA increases to the voltage level Vcc&minus;Vth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The sub decode signal SD is driven to a selected state and rises to the logic power source voltage Vccl (&equals;EVL) level. Accordingly, the voltage level of the node NA increases to the voltage level Vcc&minus;Vth&plus;Vccl level through the self boost operation. The voltage at the logic power source voltage Vccl (&equals;EVL) level is transmitted to the selected sub word line SWL, and data in the memory cell is read out. In the twin cell mode, complementary data are read out and transferred to a corresponding pair of bit lines BL and ZBL. The H-level data in the memory cell is at the level of an array power source voltage VCCA. Even when the voltage level of the selected sub word line SWL is at the logic power source voltage Vccl (EVL) level, a voltage difference large enough to be sensed by a sense amplifier can be generated between the bit lines BL and ZBL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Before returning to the precharge state, in order to perform restoring operation on the memory cell data, the voltage level of the selected sub decode signal SD is increased to raise the voltage level of the sub word line SWL. Thus, the voltage at the array power source voltage VCC level can be rewritten, with reliability, to an original memory cell storing data of the H level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In the restoring operation, the sub decode signal SD does not have to be increased in voltage level to the high voltage VPP, but is required to be at the voltage level of the array power source voltage VCCA or higher. By utilizing the self boost operation of a self boost circuit, sufficiently, the voltage level of the selected sub word line can be driven from the level of the logic power source voltage Vccl (&equals;EVL) to the level of the array power source voltage VCCA or higher. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The row decoding circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>further includes a sub decoding circuit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for decoding the predecoded signals X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to generate the sub decode signals SD and ZSD. To the sub decoding circuit <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the word line driving voltage VWL from the switching circuit (MUX) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is supplied as a power source voltage for generating the sub decode signal SD. The complementary sub decode signal ZSD has the amplitude of the voltage Vcc (DRAM source voltage EVD) in both of the twin cell mode and the single cell mode. To generate the complementary sub decode signal ZSD, the DRAM power source voltage EVD is applied. The amplitude of the sub decode signal SD is the word line driving voltage VWL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> A self boost circuit <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is provided to boost the voltage of the sub decode signal SD in the twin cell mode. The self boost circuit <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> includes a capacitor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and boosts the voltage level of the sub decode signal (any of SDO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to SDO<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and SDE<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to SDE<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) in the selected state in response to a reset signal RST generated according to a precharge command PRG in the twin cell mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> As the configuration of the self boost circuit <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, such a configuration may be used that the DRAM power source voltage EVD is supplied in the form of a one-shot pulse to the source node via a transistor having a gate in a floating state, or the gate connected to an off-state MOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the configuration of a sense amplifier band, and specifically shows the configuration of sense amplifier bands SABa and SABb provided for the memory sub array MSA. In the sense amplifier bands SABa and SABb, the sense amplifiers SA are alternately provided every other pair of bit lines BL in the memory sub array MSA. The arrangement of the sense amplifiers SA is the same as that of sense amplifiers of a conventional DRAM that operates in a single cell mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The sense amplifiers SA are coupled to the bit lines in the memory sub array MSA via the sense amplifier connection switching circuits <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The connection of the sense amplifier connection switching circuits <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will be specifically described later. Briefly, two sense amplifiers are disposed on both sides of four bit lines and two bit lines out of the three bit lines are connected to the sense amplifiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The sense amplifier SA in the sense amplifier band SABa is coupled to bit lines in a memory sub array (not shown) via a sense amplifier connection switching circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>u</italic></highlight>. The sense amplifier SA included in the sense amplifier band SABb is coupled to the bit lines BL of another memory sub array via a sense amplifier connection switching circuit <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In correspondence to the sense amplifier SA, a read amplifier gate RG that is selectively made conductive in response to the signals on the sub column select lines RSYSu and RSYSl in reading data, and a write column select gate WG that is made conductive in response to the signals on the write sub column select lines WRYSu and WRYSl are provided. In one sense amplifier band, one main read data line pair RMDP is provided for each four read amplifier gates RG, and one write main data line pair WMDP is disposed for each four write column select gates WG. The read main data line pair RMDP consists of the main read data lines RMDL and ZRMDL. The write main data line pair WMDP consists of the main write data lines WMDL and ZWMDL. The main read data lines RMDL and ZRMDL have an intersection point to cancel off the influence of noises occurring when a signal having a small amplitude is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In the sense amplifier band SABa, four read amplifier gates RG are selectively made conductive in response to the sub column select signal on the upper read sub column select line RSYSu, and data latched by the sense amplifier is transferred to the corresponding main read data lines RMDL and ZRMDL. The read amplifier gate RG includes differential MOS transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that are activated in response to the corresponding sub column select signal bit on the upper read sub column select line, to drive one of the read data lines RMDL and ZRMDL to the ground voltage level in accordance with the potential latched by the corresponding sense amplifier SA. A signal transmitted on the upper read sub column select line RSYSu is a signal of four bits driven to the L level when selected and driven to the H level when not selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Similarly, in the sense amplifier band SABa, the write column select gate WG includes a pair of MOS transistors (transfer gates) T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that are made conductive in response to a corresponding sub column select signal bit on the upper write sub column select line WRYSu to connect the sense node of the corresponding sense amplifier SA to the corresponding write main data lines WMDL and ZWMDL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Through the upper write sub column select line WRYSu as well, a four-bit sub column select signal is transmitted, and one of the four sense amplifiers is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In the sense amplifier band SABb as well, the read amplifier gate RG is selectively made active in response to the signals on the lower read sub column select line RSYSl. In response to the write column select signal on the lower write sub column select line WRYSl, the write column select gate WG is selectively made conductive. In the sense amplifier bands SABa and SABb, the gates on either of one of the upper and lower sides are made active or conductive. In the single cell mode, therefore, in the memory sub array MSA, one of eight sense amplifiers SA is selected and data is written or read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In this case, however, in each of the sense amplifier bands SABa and SABb, column selecting operation may be performed in a unit of eight sense amplifiers SA. In this case, a configuration of driving a one-bit sub column select signal into the selected state in each of the upper read sub column select line RSYSu and the lower read sub column select line RSYSl, thereby realizing, in total, a &frac18; selecting operation (8 to 1 selection) may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> A configuration of disposing a main data line pair separately for the gates of each of upper and lower sides and selecting a gate in both of the upper and lower sides of the memory sub array may be employed. In the twin cell mode, column selection is executed further by an IO selector, and connection between the global data line and the main data line is controlled so as to access data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In the single cell mode, a bit line connected to a memory cell and a bit line (reference bit line) held in the precharged state are selected to be paired for connection to the sense amplifier SA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In the twin cell mode, bit lines each connected to a memory cell are connected to the sense amplifier SA. In this case, the number of bit lines held in the precharged state is the half of the number of all bit lines in a selected bank. The number of sense amplifiers requested to perform sensing operation becomes accordingly half times. By activating only the sense amplifiers connected to selected memory cells, the sense current is decreased and the current consumption is accordingly reduced. In the twin cell mode, a control of connecting the bit line BL to a sense amplifier in the sense amplifier band SABa or SABb in one memory sub array MSA is carried out by the sense amplifier switching circuits <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>u</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, and other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a diagram schematically showing a configuration of the sense amplifier connection switching circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the memory cells MC are disposed every other row in each column. In the column direction, a pair of two memory cells MC to share a bit line contact BCT is disposed every two rows. The layout of the memory cells MC shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is slightly different from that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. However, only by changing the positions of the word lines WL (sub word lines SWL), the layout of the memory cells shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is easily achieved. The memory cells MC are therefore arranged by repeating the same pattern of four word lines WL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to WL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as a unit in the column direction. Although the word lines have a hierarchical structure, in the following description, the sub word line will be simply described as a word line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In the four word lines WL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to WL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the position of the memory cell MC is shifted by one column at the maximum. With a set of four bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being a unit, the connection between a bit line BL and a sense amplifier SA is controlled. The word lines WL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and WL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have the same connection pattern of memory cells. The word lines WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and WL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have the same connection pattern of memory cells. The word lines having the same connection patterns are classified into even-number word lines and odd-number word lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The bit line BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is connected to the corresponding sense amplifier SA via a switch circuit LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> provided on its one side. The bit line BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is coupled to sense amplifiers SAa and SAb on both sides via switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> provided on both sides of the bit line BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The bit line BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the sense amplifiers SAa and SAb via switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on both sides thereof. The bit line BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the sense amplifier SAb via a switch circuit RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided on its right side. Sets each having the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to LSW<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> arranged in the same pattern are disposed in the column direction with one column interposed between adjacent sets. Similarly, sets each having the switch circuits RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are disposed in the column direction with one column interposed between adjacent sets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In the configuration of the sense amplifier connection switching circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, two sense amplifiers SA (SAa and SAb) are provided for four bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The sense amplifiers SAa and SAb share the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the bit line BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> can be connected only to the sense amplifier SAa, and the bit line BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be connected only to the sense amplifier SAb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Since the memory cells are arranged every other column, by selecting two bit lines out of the three bit lines, the single cell mode and the twin cell mode can be achieved selectively. Since the positions of the memory cells MC are different from each other in the row direction, according to the position of the selected word line, a sense amplifier to be connected is switched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In the single cell mode, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, as shown by a pair TGP of switch circuits, with adjacent bit lines being a pair, the bit lines are connected to the sense amplifiers SA and SAa. In this case, in the sense amplifiers SA (SAa and SAb), when the word line WL is selected, the memory cells are connected to only one of the bit lines of a pair. In a manner similar to an ordinary memory of an alternately arranged, shared sense amplifier configuration, sense operation can be performed. By utilizing the conventional shared sense amplifier configuration of an alternate arrangement type, bit lines are selectively connected to sense amplifiers by the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to LSW<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thereby implementing the DRAM operating in the twin cell mode without changing the conventional configuration. The memory cell unit MU is constructed by two memory cells MC arranged with one column interposed in between. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, in the single cell mode, the sense amplifier SAa is connected to the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the sense amplifier SAb is connected to the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the switch circuits RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and RSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this state, a precharge state is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, when a word line is selected, data of the selected memory cell is transmitted to the sense amplifier SAa via the switch circuit LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, the sense amplifier SAa is connected to the precharged bit line via the switch circuit LSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Since the switch circuit RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is in an OFF state, the bit line BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is isolated from the sense amplifier SAb. On the other hand, data of another memory cell read out onto the bit line BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the sense amplifier SAb via the switch circuit RSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The precharged bit line BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is connected to the sense amplifier SAb. In a manner similar to a general DRAM of the one-bit-per-cell type, the sense operation can be performed, and collision of data does not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In the twin cell mode, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the switch circuit RSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made non-conductive, the switch circuit RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on, and the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected to the sense amplifier SAb. By making the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> conductive and the switch circuit LSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> non-conductive, the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected to the sense amplifier SAa. In such a state, therefore, different pairs of bit lines are connected to the sense amplifiers SAa and SAb while sandwiching the bit line of the other pair. Since the bit lines connected to one sense amplifier are arranged with one column interposed in between, the pair of bit lines receive memory cell data or are maintained at the precharge voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> It is now assumed that a word line WLa is selected in such a state as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In this state, the data of the selected memory cells are read onto the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The memory cell data are therefore transmitted via the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the sense amplifier SAa. On the other hand, the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> maintain the precharge state voltage level, The sense amplifier SAb is maintained in an inactive state. In the twin cell mode, only the sense amplifier receiving the data of the memory cell and provided in the sense amplifier band on one side is made active, and the sense amplifier on the other side is maintained inactive, thereby decreasing the number of sense amplifiers in operation to the half times to reduce the current consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In the case where a word line WLb is selected, data in the memory cells are read out on the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and then are transmitted to the sense amplifier SAb. The sense node in the sense amplifier SAa is connected to the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and maintains at the precharge voltage level. In this case, therefore, the sense amplifier SAa is maintained in an inactive state, and the sense amplifier SAb is made active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> By determining the position of the sense amplifier to be activated according to the position of a selected word line, in the twin cell mode, the number of sense amplifiers to be activated can be easily reduced to the half times. Specifically, by determining whether the selected word line is an even-number word line or odd-number word line, the sense amplifier to be activated is determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an example of the configuration of a portion of generating a control signal for the sense amplifier connection switching circuit.

One node of each of the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and LSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to a first sense node of the sense amplifier SAa. One node of the switch circuit LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to a second sense node of the sense amplifier SAa. On the other hand, a first sense node of the sense amplifier SAb is connected to the bit line BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> via the switch circuit RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, and a second sense node is connected to the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the switch circuits RSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> The configuration of simultaneously selecting two word lines can be used similarly in the configuration where four sub word lines are arranged per main word line. By constructing the subdecoder so as to always designate a pair of word lines (sub word lines) having different memory cell positions by degenerating the predecoded signal of one bit, the configuration of driving two word lines (sub word lines) simultaneously to a selected state can be easily realized. Although a sense peak current increases, the refresh interval twice as long as the conventional one can be set. The average current consumption in the standby mode as much as that in the first embodiment can be accordingly achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the second embodiment of the invention, in the twin cell mode, two adjacent word lines (sub word lines) are simultaneously driven to a selected state. Without changing the page size between the single cell mode and the twin cell mode, a high speed access is achieved. In the twin cell mode, complementary memory cell data are transmitted onto bit lines in a pair. Consequently, the long refresh internal can be achieved and accordingly, the average refresh current can be reduced. </paragraph>

A case where an odd-number word line (sub word line) WLo is in a selected state, data of the odd-number word line WLo is latched by the left sense amplifier SAL, and data access to the sense amplifier SAL is made will be discussed. When an auto refresh command is applied from outside the memory and an even-number word line WLe is designated as a refresh row, data of memory cells of the even-number word line WLe on the refresh row is refreshed by the right sense amplifier SAR. Specifically, in a state where the data of the odd-number word line WLo is saved and latched in the left sense amplifier SAL, the odd-number word line WLo is made inactive, the even-number word line WLe as a new subject to be refreshed is driven to a selected state, and memory cell data is refreshed by the right sense amplifier SAR. This saving operation is performed for a reason that a plurality of word lines cannot be driven into a selected state at different timings in the same memory block (bank memory array), and row selection operation can be made active or inactive independently only on a bank basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a diagram showing another state of a selected word line in the third embodiment of the invention.

In this case, data in the even-number word line WLe is transferred to the sense amplifier SAR and latched therein. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows a state where the data is latched and all of the switch circuits RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are set to a non-conductive state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the odd-number word line WLo to be refreshed is selected, and data in memory cells selected by the odd-number word line WLo is refreshed by the left sense amplifier SAL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> When the activated word line to be accessed and the word line to be refreshed have the same memory cell connection pattern, data conflict occurs in the sense amplifier.

In this case, the sense amplifier SAL is made active, and data of memory cells connected to the odd-number word line WLo in the row to be refreshed is refreshed. In memory blocks (bank memory arrays) sharing a sense amplifier band, when the connection pattern of memory cells (layout pattern of memory cells) in an accessed row and that in a row to be refreshed are different from each other, data access and refresh are executed in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a diagram schematically showing a potential change in signal lines in the third embodiment of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, in response to a row access command, the word line WLac is driven to a selected state, and complementary data are read out onto a corresponding pair of bit lines BLac and /BLac. Subsequently, the sense amplifier SAac is activated and a voltage of the corresponding bit line pair is differentially amplified and latched. Accordingly, a write command instructing writing of data and a read command instructing reading of data are applied and data access is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> When an auto refresh command is applied in such a state, first, the word line WLac being accessed is once set to a non-selected state. In the non-selected state, when the auto refresh is performed, the word line having the same memory cell connection pattern does not become a refresh target to be refreshed. Consequently, it is unnecessary to particularly isolate the sense amplifier SAac from the bit lines BLac and /BLac. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> By the auto refresh command, a word line WLrf to be refreshed is driven to a selected state, and complementary data are read out to the corresponding pair of bit lines BLrf and /BLrf. Subsequently, a sense amplifier SArf in the non-selected state is activated to amplify and latch data of the pair of bit lines BLrf and /BLrf. In such a manner, data of memory cells (memory unit) connected to the word line WLrf is refreshed. After elapse of a predetermined refresh period, the refresh word line WLrf enters a non-selected state, the sense amplifier SArf enters a non-selected state, and the bit lines BLrf and /BLrf return a precharged state. </paragraph>

In order to write back data, the original word line WLac is driven again to a selected state, and data stored in the sense amplifier SAac is rewritten to the original memory cell connected to the word line WLac. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> In the case of accessing and refreshing data in the word lines having different memory connection patterns, therefore, two word lines can be equivalently, simultaneously selected, and refresh can be executed without interrupting data access. A column select gate for writing and reading data is provided adjacent to the sense amplifier. A column access is performed on the upper sense amplifier or lower sense amplifier. Therefore, the column access can be continuously executed to the same sense amplifier band without being interrupted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In the case where the bit line precharging/equalizing circuit is provided adjacent to a sense amplifier in a sense amplifier band and is shared by adjacent bit lines, it is not particularly necessary to make an activated sense amplifier latch memory cell data for isolation from the memory sub array. However, in the arrangement in which the bit line precharging/equalizing circuit is provided for each bit line pair, and is not shared between adjacent bit lines, the sense amplifier SAac in an active state has to be isolated from the corresponding bit lines BLac and /BLac during the refresh period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is a diagram schematically showing the configuration of a refresh determining circuit. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> semiconductor memory device has a multi-bank configuration, and a sense amplifier band is shared between different banks. The refresh determining circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is therefore provided for each bank. In the case of the single bank configuration, the refresh determining circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is so provided as to be shared by a plurality of memory blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the refresh determining circuit includes: a same row determining circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for determining whether or not a least significant active address signal bit ACA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> from the memory outside coincides with a least significant refresh address count bit RACA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>; a same block determining circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for determining whether or not a corresponding bank address signal ABAi coincides with a bank specifying count bit RABAi from the refresh address counter; and a neighboring block determining circuit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for determining whether or not the bank address signal ABAi supplied to an adjacent block (bank) coincides with a refresh bank designating count bit RABAj from the refresh address counter. The determining circuits <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are activated when an auto refresh instruction signal (auto refresh command) ARF is supplied, and the coincidence determining operation is executed. Since the auto refresh command is supplied in a bank basis, the auto refresh command ARF has also the bank specifying function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Whether a word line being accessed is an even-number word line or odd-number word line is determined by the least significant active address signal bit ACA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. The predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is generated on the basis of the active address signal ACA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. The predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> may be therefore used for the determination. When the refresh address count bit RACA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the active address signal bit ACA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> coincide with each other, a word line having the same memory connection pattern as that of a word line of which data is being accessed is specified as a row to be refreshed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> As for determination by the same block determination circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, when the bank address signal ABAi for designating its own block (bank) itself is active and the bank address signal RABAi supplied from the refresh address counter specifies its own block (bank), that is, the refresh bank address signal RABAi obtained by decoding the most significant count bit of the refresh address counter also becomes active, the same block determining circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> determines that the data access and refresh are made to the same block (bank). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> The neighboring block determining circuit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> determines that refresh to an adjacent block is designated when the active bank address signal ABAi is in an active state and a refresh bank address signal (refresh block address signal) RABAj obtained by decoding, for example, most significant three bits (in the case of an eight bank configuration) of the refresh address counter becomes active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> The neighboring block determining circuit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> therefore determines whether refresh is designated to the upper memory block (bank) or the lower block (bank) with respect to one bank. In the determining operation, permission/inhibition of the refresh for each bank is determined according to a bank address signal assigned to each bank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> The refresh determining circuit further includes: an NAND circuit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for receiving a determination result signal of the same row determining circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a determination result signal of the same block determining circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>; an NAND circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for receiving a determination result signal of the same row determining circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a determination result signal of the neighboring block determining circuit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>; an NAND circuit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> for receiving determination result signals from the same block determining circuit <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the neighboring block determining circuit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>; an OR circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for receiving output signals of the NAND circuits <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and outputting a refresh execution permission signal RFGO; and an OR circuit <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> for receiving determination result signals of the determining circuits <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and outputting a refresh inhibition signal RFGON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Upon detection of coincidence, each of the determining circuits <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> outputs a signal of the H level. The NAND circuit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> outputs a signal of the L level when a word line being accessed and a word line requested for refreshing have the same connection pattern in the same block (memory bank array). The NAND circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> outputs a signal of the L level when a refresh request is applied to the word line having the same memory cell connection pattern in the adjacent block (bank). The NAND circuit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> outputs a signal of the L level when the block (bank) to be refreshed is the same or adjacent block. When those conditions are not satisfied, the refresh permission signal RFGO from the OR circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> goes high and refresh is executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Consequently, when the following condition is satisfied, the refresh execution inhibition signal RFGON goes high, refresh is not performed until the next cycle or a wait signal is sent to the logic and then refresh is executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The condition is that word lines having the same memory cell connection pattern in the same block (bank) or adjacent blocks (banks) are to be accessed and refreshed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Specifically, refresh is internally executed without stopping the data access in the following three cases: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> (1) a case where an even-number word line and an odd-number word line are accessed and refreshed in the same block (bank); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> (2) a case where an even-number word line and an odd-number word line are accessed and refreshed in adjacent blocks (banks); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> (3) a case where refresh and data access is performed in memory blocks in places other than the same block (bank) or adjacent blocks (banks). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> In the case of a so-called block division (partial activation) configuration, not the bank configuration, it is sufficient to use a block selection signal BASi in place of the bank address signal ABAi. In the block division configuration as well, it is unnecessary to actually activate word lines at different timings so as to bring two word lines simultaneously in a selected state, refresh can be executed without interrupting data access. By selecting a row to be refreshed under a state where data to be accessed is latched by the sense amplifier, equivalently, a row to be accessed and a row to be refreshed are simultaneously driven to a selected state by the sense amplifiers, and data access and refresh are executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a diagram schematically showing the configuration of a bank control circuitry. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> shows the configuration related to a bank specified by one active bank address signal ABAi. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the bank control circuitry includes: an AND circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for receiving a row active command RACT for instructing row selection and the active bank address signal ABAi; an AND circuit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> for receiving the precharge command PRG for instructing precharge of an array and a precharge bank address PBAi; an OR circuit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> for receiving an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the refresh execution permission signal RFGO; an OR circuit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for receiving a write back instruction signal &phgr;WR and an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>; a set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> set in response to the rising edge of an output signal of the OR circuit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and reset in response to the falling edge of an output signal of the OR circuit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>; a pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> for generating a pulse signal RFRAS having a predetermined time width in accordance with the refresh execution permission signal RFGO; an OR circuit <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> for receiving an output signal RRAS of the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and a pulse signal RFRAS outputted from the pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and generating an internal array activating signal RAS; a row control circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> for sequentially activating a bit line precharging/equalizing instruction signal BLEQ, a word line driving timing signal WLX, and a sense amplifier enable fast signal SAF in accordance with the array activating signal RAS from the OR circuit <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>; and a one-shot pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> for generating the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR of one shot after elapse of predetermined time in response to inactivation of the pulse signal RFRAS from the pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> for application to the OR circuit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> generates the pulse signal RFRAS of one shot having a time width necessary for refresh. After completion of the refreshing operation, that is, after completion of a so-called RAS precharge period, the one-shot pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> generates the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR in the form of one shot pulse. The operation of the bank control circuitry shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> will be described with reference to the signal waveform diagram shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> First, the row active command RACT is supplied. When the active bank address signal ABAi is at the H level, the output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> becomes high, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is set, and the output signal RRAS of the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Responsively, the array activating signal RAS from the OR circuit <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> goes high. Accordingly, first, the row control circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> lowers the bit line precharging/equalizing instruction signal BLEQ to the L level, raises a word line driving timing signal WLX to the H level and then, activates the sense amplifier enable fast signal SAF to the H level. In such a manner, the word line corresponding to an addressed row in a selected memory block (bank) is driven to a selected state. Data of memory cells connected to the selected word line is sensed, amplified, and latched by a corresponding sense amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> When the auto refresh command ARF instructing the refreshing operation is applied in a column access in this above state, first, by the refresh determining circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the permission/inhibition of the refresh is determined. In the case where the refresh is performed, the refresh execution permission signal RFGO goes high, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is reset, and the output signal RRAS of the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> goes low. Accordingly, the array activating signal RAS from the OR circuit <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> goes low, and the row control circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> sequentially drives the word line driving timing signal WLX and the sense amplifier enable fast signal SAF into an inactive state, to return the corresponding memory block (bank memory array) to a precharged state, and sets the bit line precharging/equalizing instruction signal BLEQ to the H level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> After the precharging operation by the row control circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is completed, the pulse signal RFRAS from the pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is made active. According to the pulse signal RFRAS, the array activating signal RAS goes high again. By the row control circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, the bit line precharging/equalizing instruction signal BLEQ goes low again, and the word line driving timing signal WLX and the sense amplifier enable fast signal SAF are sequentially activated. When the pulse signal RFRAS goes low, the refreshing operation is completed. Accordingly, the array activating signal RAS goes low, and the memory block (bank memory array) goes back to the precharged state again. After elapse of predetermined time period since the pulse signal RFRAS goes low, the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR from the one-shot pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> goes high again, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is set, the output signal RRAS of the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> goes high, and the array activating signal RAS is activated. By the write back operation, the word line being accessed by the write back operation is driven again to the selected state, and data is rewritten to an original memory cell. In such a manner, the refresh can be executed internally without exerting an adverse influence on the column access operation. It is constructed such that even when the array activating signal is made inactive, the column selecting operation is performed at the time of the &ldquo;hidden refresh&rdquo; operation as described above. This is easily implemented by maintaining active the array activating signal applied to a circuit for controlling the column accessing operation when the refresh execution permission signal RFGO is active. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> In the single cell mode, an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is fixed at the L level. In this case, when the array activating signal RAS is made active, the bit line precharging/equalization instruction signal BLEQ is made inactive by the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>, and the bit line precharging and equalizing operation is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> In the twin cell mode, an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>is fixed at the L level. When the array activating signal RAS is made active, an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>goes high according to the corresponding predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> or X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, and the bit line precharge/equalization instruction signal BLEQ goes low responsively. When the predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the H level, the corresponding sense amplifier SA is made active. At this time, the corresponding bit line precharge/equalization instruction signal BLEQ is made inactive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> In the case of executing the refresh in the background during the data access, first, according to the refresh execution permission signal RFGO, an output signal of the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>goes high. When the predecoded signal /LX<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> from the address saving circuit is at the H level, an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>goes high responsively, and an output signal of the OR circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>goes high. In this case, therefore, when the refresh execution permission signal RFGO is made active, the bit line precharge/equalization instruction signal BLEQ is held in an inactive state of the L level, and the corresponding sense amplifier maintains the active state. In such a manner, the saved data can be held in the sense amplifier with reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> When the write back instruction signal &phgr;WL is made active, the output signal of the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>goes low, and the output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>goes low. In this case, according to the array activate signal RAS again, in the write back operation, the corresponding predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> or X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> goes high, an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>goes high, and responsively, an output signal of the OR circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>goes high. In this state as well, therefore, the bit line precharge/equalization instruction signal BLEQ maintains at the L level, and an adverse influence is not exerted on the data retaining operation of the sense amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> In the case of performing the refreshing operation in the background when the bit line precharge/equalization instruction signal BLEQ is at the H level, even when the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is set, the latched predecoded signal LX<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> from the address saving circuit is at the L level, and an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is at the L level. In such a state, therefore, the output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>goes high in accordance with the array activating signal RAS and the predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> or X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the refresh address signal, the bit line precharge/equalization instruction signal BLEQ goes low, and the sensing operation and refresh can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Different from the configuration that the bit line precharging/equalizing circuit <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is shared by the memory blocks (banks) on both sides thereof as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, when the bit line precharging/equalizing circuit <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is provided in correspondence to each bit line pair of the memory block (bank memory array), it is sufficient to simply control the bit line precharging/equalization instruction signal BLEQ to be active or inactive in accordance with the array activating signal RAS. Although the bit line isolation instruction signal BIL has to be controlled, in this case, to be forcedly made inactive to render the bit line isolation gate nonconductive by an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, the configuration for isolating the sense amplifier being in a data latching state from a bit line can be easily implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the third embodiment of the present invention, the refresh and data access is performed simultaneously on memory blocks (bank memory arrays) which are apart from each other by one or more memory blocks (memory banks) or on word lines having different memory cell connection patterns. Without interruption of the data access, refresh can be performed. Thus, high speed access can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> When the background refresh could not be permitted, the refresh execution inhibition signal RFGON is supplied to a logic on the memory outside. The access is suspended and refresh is performed under the control of the logic on the outside, or the refresh is not performed until the next refresh cycle in such a case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</cross-reference> is a diagram schematically showing the state of a memory sub array in the standby state of a semiconductor memory device according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>A, the twin cell mode is set, the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are coupled to the sense amplifier SAR via switch circuits RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are coupled to the sense amplifier SAL via switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> The word line WL is in a non-selected state, and accordingly the memory cell MC is in a non-selected state. Switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and RSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are in an OFF state. In a standby state, the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are precharged and equalized to an intermediate voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>B, when an active cycle starts and an odd-number word line WLo is selected, data in the memory cells MC connected to the odd-number word line WLo is transferred to the sense amplifier SAL via the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and amplified and latched by the sense amplifier SAL. The data access is made on the sense amplifier SAL on the left side. On the other hand, the sense amplifier SAR on the right side maintains an inactive state, and all of the switch circuits RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are in a nonconductive state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>C, when a refresh request to another odd-number word line is generated, the switch circuit RSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made conductive, and data latched in the sense amplifier SAL is transferred to the sense amplifier SAR via the bit line BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the sense amplifier SAR is activated, and data in the memory cells of the odd-number word line WLo are latched by the sense amplifiers SAR. The data access during the transfer operation is executed to the sense amplifier SAL. After completion of transference of data, the data access is executed to the sense amplifier SAR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>A, after transferring data of the word line WLo to the sense amplifiers SAR, the sense amplifiers SAL are made inactive, and all of the switch circuits RSWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to RSWL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned off, thereby isolating the sense amplifier SAR from the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the memory sub array is returned back to the precharged state, and the precharging and equalizing operation on the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> In the bit line precharging and equalizing operation, when the bit line precharging/equalizing circuit is provided adjacent to the sense amplifier in the sense amplifier band, although the precharging/equalizing operation on the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> cannot be performed, the word line to be selected next is an odd-number word line. The bit line onto which memory cell data is read can be precharged and equalized to the intermediate voltage level by the precharging/equalizing circuit adjacent to the sense amplifier SAL, and a problem does not particularly occur. When the bit line precharging/equalizing circuit is provided for each bit line pair, all of the switch circuits RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are in the OFF state. Without influencing the data latched by the sense amplifier SAR, all of the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be precharged and equalized to the intermediate voltage level. Any of the previously described configurations can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> The data latched in the sense amplifiers SAR are accessed under the above state. Since the sense amplifier to be accessed is switched, the position of the column decoding circuit to be activated with respect to the upper and lower column decoding circuits is alternated. In this case, the refresh execution inhibition signal RFGON described in the third embodiment is used as a same row refresh identification flag in the fourth embodiment. By using the flag RFGON, the sense amplifier to be accessed is switched from the sense amplifier SAL to the sense amplifier SAR, or vice versa. The switching operation is performed internally. An external logic can access data irrespective of the position switching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>B, according to the refresh address, a word line WLor is driven to a selected state, a sensing operation is performed by the sense amplifier SAL, and data of memory cells connected to the word line WLor are refreshed. In the sense amplifiers SAR, the previous data of the accessed word line WLo are latched, and the data in the sense amplifiers SAR are accessed. In the refreshing operation as well, the switch circuits RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are in the OFF state. Even when memory cell data of the word line WLor of a refresh row is read out onto the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, no adverse influence is exerted on the data latched in the sense amplifiers SAR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> After completion of the refreshing operation, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32C, a</cross-reference> precharging operation is performed to make the sense amplifier SAL inactive. At least, the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are precharged to an intermediate voltage level. The bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are either precharged or maintained in the floating state depending on the arrangemnet of the bit line precharging/equalizing circuit. In the precharged state, the data in the sense amplifier SAR is accessed as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>A, the switch circuit RSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on again, and the data latched by the sense amplifier SAR is transferred to the sense amplifier SAL via the bit line BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the switch circuit LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>B, the original word line WLo to be accessed is driven to a selected state, and data are rewritten to the memory cells connected to the word line WLo (write back operation). At this time, the sense amplifier SAL is activated again, and after completion of the write back, data in the sense amplifier SAL is accessed. The sense amplifier SAR may be maintained in the active state or in the inactive state. When the sense amplifier SAR is maintained in the active state and an odd-number row has to be refreshed again, data transfer to the sense amplifier SAR is stopped to perform a data access. The sense amplifier SAR may be driven to an inactive state after completion of the write back operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> The operation (write back operation) of transferring data from the sense amplifier SAR to the sense amplifier SAL may not be performed. When the original word line WLo is selected, the sense amplifier SAL is made active to amplify and latch the memory cell data according to the word line selecting operation sequence. After that, the data access to the sense amplifier SAL can be successively performed. By transferring data for the write back, a data definition timing of the sense amplifier can be set accurately. A timing of switching the sense amplifier of which data is accessed can be set accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> After completion of an access to the word line WLo, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>C, the sense amplifiers SAL and SAR are made inactive, and the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are returned back to a precharged state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C illustrate the refreshing operation performed when the odd-number word line WLo is active. In the case of refreshing an even-number word line when the even-number word line is selected, data is transferred from the sense amplifier SAR to the sense amplifier SAL to perform the data access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> In the adjacent block (bank), a word line having the same memory cell connection pattern as the selected word line under accessing can be refreshed. After saving data to the sense amplifier, refresh is executed. In the case of performing the refresh in an adjacent memory block (adjacent bank memory array), the sense amplifier to be used for the refreshing is isolated from the memory block (bank memory array) being accessed. Consequently, the refresh can be performed in the adjacent memory block (bank memory array) through a similar control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> In the fourth embodiment, in the configuration of the refresh determining circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the refresh inhibition signal RFGON is used as a flag indicative of saving of access data to the sense amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> is a diagram schematically showing the configuration of a row control unit in the bank control circuit in the fourth embodiment of the present invention. The configuration of the bank control circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> is the same as the bank control circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, except that a refresh instruction signal ARFi is used in place of the refresh execution permission signal RFGO. The other configuration is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> and the corresponding parts are designated by the same reference numerals. The refresh instruction signal ARFi is generated through ANDing of the auto refresh command ARF and the refresh bank address signal. When the auto refresh is instructed to a corresponding bank (memory block), the bank control circuit operates. When the refresh instruction signal ARFi is made active, the pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> generates a pulse signal RFRAS after elapse of a predetermined period (after elapse of the RAS precharge time and time required to save data). After completion of refresh, the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR is made active, and saved data is loaded in response to the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, after data is saved according to the auto refresh instruction signal ARFi, an output signal of the OR circuit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is made active, and the operation of precharging the memory sub array (bank memory array) is executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> is a diagram schematically showing the configuration of a row selecting circuit in the fourth embodiment of the present invention. The configuration of the row selecting circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> is the same as that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, except that the auto refresh instruction signal ARFi is supplied in place of the refresh execution permission signal RFGO to the bidirectional transferring circuit (XFER) <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The other configuration is the same, the corresponding parts are designated by the same reference numerals, and their detailed description will not be repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> In the fourth embodiment, when there is a possibility that refresh data and access data collides with each other on a bit line, the access data is saved in the sense amplifier. Consequently, irrespective of the address of a row to be refreshed, auto refresh is executed. When the auto refresh instruction signal ARFi is made active, therefore, the address of a word line being accessed is saved in the address saving circuit <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> There is a case where refresh is executed in an adjacent block. As a transfer instruction signal (save instruction signal) to the bidirectional transferring circuit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, an auto refresh command for the adjacent memory block is additionally supplied to the adjacent memory block (bank). When either of the transfer instruction signals is activated, an address is saved. When the refresh is not performed in a corresponding memory block (bank memory array), the row latch circuit <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>still latches the address of a word line to be activated. Particularly, even when the word line address is saved in the address saving circuit <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> in the operation of refreshing the adjacent block, no problem occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the configuration of a sense amplifier control circuit in the fourth embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, in addition to the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, the following is provided; an AND circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for receiving the same row instruction signal RFGON and the predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>; a delay circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for delaying the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR by a predetermined period; a set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> set in response to the rising edge of an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and reset in response to the rising edge of an output signal of the delay circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>; and an OR circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for receiving an output signal of the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and output signals of the AND circuits <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. An output signal of the OR circuit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is supplied to the AND circuit <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that receives the twin cell mode instruction signal &phgr;TWN at its first input node. The other configuration of the sense amplifier control circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. The corresponding parts are designated by the same reference numerals and their detailed description will not be repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> In the configuration of the sense amplifier control circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, when the predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the H level, the corresponding sense amplifier activating signal SAEa is activated. In the case of the refreshing of the same row (having the same memory cell connection pattern), the same row instruction signal RFGON is activated. At this time, when the corresponding sense amplifier activating signal SAEa is inactive, the predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the H level (since the complementary predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the L level), the output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> goes high, and the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is set. Accordingly, the sense amplifier activating signal SAEa in the inactive state is made active, and transfer data (saved data) is latched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> After completion of the write back operation, after elapse of the delay time of the delay circuit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is reset, and the sense amplifier activating signal SAEa is made inactive. The sense amplifier activate signal SAEa may be made inactive in response to a precharge command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> In the refreshing operation in the background, the sense amplifier activating signal SAEb is made active. Consequently, the least significant predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of a refresh address is at the H level, the complementary predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the latched predecoded signal /LX<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> are at the L level, and the output signals of the AND circuits <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are at the L level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> In the case where the corresponding sense amplifier activating signal SAEa latches the access data, the complementary predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the H level. In this case, even when the same row selection instruction signal RFGON is made active, an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is at the L level, and the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> maintains the reset state. By using the configuration of the refresh control circuit in the third embodiment, according to the auto refresh instruction signal ARFi, the array activating signal (RAS) is made inactive, the sense amplifier enable fast signal SAFa is made inactive, and the sense amplifier activating signal SAEa is made inactive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, refresh is executed. In the refresh of the same row (having the same memory connection pattern), the signal RFGO is at the L level, and the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>maintains the reset state. According to the refresh address signal, the predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> goes high again, and the sense amplifier activating signal SAEa is made active according to the sense amplifier enable fast signal SAFa. As described above, after allowing the sense amplifier in an active state to return back to the precharged state once, the sense amplifier can be made active again for refresh. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the bit line precharging/equalizing control circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> is equivalent to that of the sense amplifier control circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, except that the logic level of an output signal is inverted. When a corresponding sense amplifier is active, the bit line precharge/equalization instruction signal BLEQa is inactive. When the corresponding sense amplifier is inactive, the bit line precharge/equalization instruction signal BLEQa is active. Consequently, when the sense amplifier for latching saved data is made active, the bit line precharge/equalization instruction signal BLEQ (BLEQa, BLEQb) is accordingly made inactive and the precharging and equalizing operation of the sense nodes can be completed. The configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> can be applied when the bit line precharging/equalizing circuit is disposed in a sense amplifier band. When the bit line precharging/equalizing circuit is provided in each bit line pair, it is sufficient to precharge and equalize a bit line in accordance with the array activating signal RAS and the memory block designation signal (bank selection signal). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a modification of the sense amplifier control circuit.

<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> An output signal of the OR circuit <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is supplied to a second input of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that receives the twin cell mode instruction signal &phgr;TWN at its first input. The other configuration is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> In the configuration of the sense amplifier control circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference>, in the write back operation, the sense amplifier in the inactive state is made active in response to the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR. That is, when the sense amplifier used for refreshing becomes inactive, after elapse of a predetermined time, the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR is made active. Accordingly, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is set, a signal of the output Q of the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> goes high, and the sense amplifier activating signal SAEa (or SAEb) is made active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, when the array activating signal RAS goes high, an output signal of the delay circuit <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> goes high. The delay time of the delay circuit <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is longer than time of a period since the array activating signal RAS is made active until the sense amplifier enable fast signal SAFa is made active. After the sense amplifier enable fast signal SAFa is made active and the output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>goes high, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is reset. In the write back operation, therefore, after completion of the auto refresh operation, the sense amplifier used for refresh can be driven to an active state for latching transfer data before the original row under access is driven to a selected state. </paragraph>

An output signal of the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is supplied to the OR circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>. By appropriately adjusting the delay time of the delay circuit <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, the bit line precharge/equalization instruction signal BLEQ can be made inactive in transferring latched data (for write back). </paragraph>

The operation of the control circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> will be briefly described below. In the following description, it is assumed, for better understanding, that both of the adjacent block selection signals BSk and BSm are at the L level in the non-selected state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> In a standby cycle, the array activating signal /RAS is at the H level, and output signals of the NOR circuits <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> are at the L level. The set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is in the reset state, and its output signal is at the L level. Output signals of the NOR circuits <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> are therefore at the H level. According to the operation mode, one of the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and LSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on, one of the switch circuits RSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on, and the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> are in the ON state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> In a normal data access operation in the twin cell mode, the twin cell mode instruction signal /&phgr;TWN is set to the L level. The NOR circuits <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> therefore operate as an inverter. When the predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the H level, the complementary predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the L level, and the NOR circuits <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> output signals of the L level and the H level, respectively. When the array activating signal /RAS goes low from the H level to the L level, the status of each of the predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is decided, and an output signal of the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> goes high. Since the adjacent block selection signal BSk is at the L level, the isolation control signal BILa from the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> goes low. All of the isolation control signals &phgr;L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to &phgr;L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> go low, so that the sense amplifier SAa is isolated from the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the H level, and an output signal of the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> is at the H level. Even when the array activating signal /RAS goes low, an output signal of the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> maintains the L level. Since the adjacent block selection signal BSm is therefore at the L level in the inactive state and the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is in the reset state, the isolation control signal BILb from the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> maintains the H level. According to the twin cell mode instruction signal &phgr;TWN and the complementary twin cell mode instruction signal /&phgr;TWN, the isolation control signal &phgr;R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> goes low and the isolation control signal &phgr;R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> goes high since the twin cell mode is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> When the same row instruction signal RFGON goes high in such a state, since the predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the H level, an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> goes high, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is set, an output signal of the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> goes high, and the output signal BILa of the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> accordingly maintains the L level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> At this time, an output signal of the OR circuit <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> goes high in response to the same row instruction signal RFGON, the pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> generates a one-shot pulse signal, and output signals of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and the OR circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> accordingly go high. The isolation control signal &phgr;L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> goes high, the switch circuit LSW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made conductive, and latched data is transferred from the sense amplifier SAb to the sense amplifier SAa via the bit line BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As described above, the transferred data is latched by the sense amplifier SAa when the sense amplifier SAa is activated. After completion of the data transfer, an output signal of the pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> attains the L level, and the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> enter the off state in accordance with the isolation control signal BILa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> maintains the reset state, and the output signal of the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is at the L level, so that the isolation control signal BILb from the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> maintains the H level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> Since the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> returns to the reset state once for the refreshing operation, even when the array activating signal /RAS is kept at the H level, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is in the set state, the output signal BILa of the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> maintains the L level, all of the isolation control signals &phgr;L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to &phgr;L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> maintain the L level, the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> maintain the off state, and the sense amplifier SAa maintains the latching state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, upon resetting, since the array activating signal /RAS goes high, the output signal of the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> maintains the L level, the isolation control signal BILb maintains the H level, and the sense amplifier SAb is connected to the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the twin cell mode. In such a state, the bit lines are precharged and equalized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> When the refreshing operation is performed, a word line having the same memory connection pattern is refreshed. Consequently, the predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the H level, and the predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the L level. Even when the array activating signal /RAS goes low, due to the H level of the output signal of the NOR circuit <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, the isolation control signal BILb maintains the H level. On the other hand, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is in the set state, so that the isolation control signal BILa maintains the L level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> After completion of the refreshing operation. the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR is activated, the pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> generates a one-shot pulse signal responsively, the transfer control signal &phgr;L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is accordingly set to the H level for a predetermined period, and the sense amplifier SAa is connected to the bit line BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Since the predecoded signal /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is at the L level, an output signal of the AND circuit <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> maintains the L level, and the isolation control signal &phgr;R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> maintains the L level. The sense amplifier SAb receives the latched data from the sense amplifier SAa via the switch circuits LSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and RSW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the sense amplifier SAb is made active again, and the original word line is driven to the selected state. By the series of these operations, the write back control can be implemented. The data transfer from the sense amplifier SAa to the sense amplifier SAb is carried out as in the above description of the operations. That is, the predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is set to the L level, the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is reset, and the set/reset flip flop <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> In refreshing a word line having a different memory cell connection pattern, an unused sense amplifier is isolated from the corresponding bit line in accordance with the array activating signal /RAS and the predecoded signal X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. In the state where the sense amplifier for data accessing is isolated from the corresponding bit line, the refresh is performed. After completion of the refresh, according to the array activating signal /RAS and the predecoded signals X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and /X<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the sense amplifier for data accessing is connected to the bit line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> After completion of the refresh, in response to the write back instruction signal, a one-shot pulse signal is generated from the pulse generating circuit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, so that there is a possibility that data collision occurs. In order to prevent this collision, it is sufficient to supply, to the OR circuit <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, an ANDed signal of the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR and the refresh execution permission signal RFGO, in place of the write back instruction signal &phgr;WR. In refreshing a row of a different memory cell connection pattern, by inhibiting the write back transfer, such data collision can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> When the adjacent block is refreshed in the twin cell mode, the connection between a sense amplifier and a bit line is controlled according to the block selection signals BSk and BSm. For example, when the adjacent memory block (bank memory array) is refreshed by using the sense amplifier SAb while the sense amplifier SAa is used for accessing data, the sense amplifier SAb is isolated from the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to BL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The isolation control signals BILa and BILb are selectively made inactive by the block selection signals BSk ad BSm applied to the NOR circuits <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> In the case of refreshing a word line having the same memory cell connection pattern, after the operation of saving memory cell data, the adjacent memory block is refreshed. In the case of refreshing a word line having a different memory connection pattern, the sense amplifier for refresh in the inactive state is isolated from the bit lines, and the adjacent memory block is refreshed using the sense amplifier for refresh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> In the single cell mode, the twin cell mode instruction signal /&phgr;TWN is at the H level, and the output signals of the NOR circuits <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> are fixed at the L level. According to the array activating signal /RAS, therefore, the isolation control signals BILa and BILb are made active or inactive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the fourth embodiment of the invention, in the case of refreshing a word line having the same memory connection pattern as that of a word line being accessed, data is once saved in the sense amplifier in an inactive state. Consequently, a column can be accessed without waiting due to auto refresh, and a high speed access processing system can be configured. In this case, the number of sense amplifiers simultaneously operate is the half of the total number. Thus, a peak current of the sense amplifiers can be reduced, and the current consumption can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> Modifications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, a DRAM merged with a logic has been described. In a standard DRAM as well, similar effects can be obtained by providing one sense amplifier for each of two trios each consisting of three bit lines with respect to each quartet of bit lines (a set of four bit lines) and by selectively connecting two bit lines out of each of the trios of bit lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> In addition, in applying an active command for instructing a data access to an adjacent bank in place of the auto refresh command, by performing a similar saving operation, a row can be accessed also in a bank sharing the sense amplifier band. By selectively driving two word lines in adjacent banks, columns can be sequentially accessed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, the connection between a bit line and a first sense amplifier is switched according an operation mode instruction signal. The sense amplifiers can be efficiently used according to an operation mode, and the current consumption can be reduced without deteriorating access efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>
