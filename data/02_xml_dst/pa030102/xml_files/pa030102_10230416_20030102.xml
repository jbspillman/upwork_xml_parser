<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects for use in inspecting particles existing on thin film substrates, semiconductor substrates, photomasks and so on, and pattern defects encountered on patterns on such materials, and analyzing the cause of the defects in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips (dies) and liquid crystal products, wherein the method and apparatus of the invention display an inspection result in such a form that enables the user to readily analyze the result and rapidly identify the cause of failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, the technology for detecting defects on semiconductor devices and so on using an optical measuring means has been widely known. For example, &ldquo;Semiconductor Wafer Inspection Apparatus&rdquo; described in JP-A-62-89336 discloses a technique for irradiating a semiconductor substrate with a laser to detect scattered light from particles, if attached on the semiconductor substrate, and comparing the detected scattered light with the result of an inspection, which has been made immediately before on the same type of semiconductor substrate, to inspect the particles and/or defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Also, &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Measuring Information on Particle or defect Size&rdquo; described in JP-A-5-273110 discloses a method of measuring sizes of particles or crystal defects, which involves irradiating an object under inspection with a laser beam, receiving scattered light from possible particles or crystal defects on the object under inspection, and processing the scattered light to generate an image of the object under inspection on which the sizes of particles and crystal defects are measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Also, &ldquo;Yield Monitoring and Analysis in Semiconductor Manufacturing&rdquo; in prescripts of VLSI technology Seminar, pp. 4-42-4-47, in SEMICON Kansai, 1997, discloses an approach for analyzing the yield from particles detected on a semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, as an approach for managing product manufacturing processes in manufacturing lines for semiconductor substrates, thin film substrates and so on, a management approach is employed for monitoring particles and defects on substrates. Such a monitoring method involves inspecting particles or pattern defects on substrates by use of an apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects, monitoring a transition of the number of particles and/or defects detected by the inspection apparatus, and conducting a failure analysis on the particles and/or defects on substrates, from which a large number of particles and/or defects have been detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, this prior art approach requires a total time for the failure analysis equal to the product of the number of detected particles/defects and a time required for the failure analysis on one particle/defect. Particularly, the failure analysis requires a prohibitively long time when the particle/defect inspection apparatus detects a large number of particles and/or defects, thereby giving rise to a problem that the manufacturing of substrates is delayed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made to solve the problem of the prior art as mentioned above, and provides a method and apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects for use in inspection and failure analysis on processes for manufacturing semiconductor wafers and thin film substrates, which are capable of performing an inspection in accordance with sizes of particles and pattern defects or the characteristics of each region on an object under inspection to take prompt countermeasures to a failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the present invention provides a particle/defect inspection apparatus for measuring an object under inspection in accordance with an optical approach to detect particles and/or defects thereon. The inspection apparatus includes illuminating means for illuminating light to an object under inspection, light detecting means for detecting reflected light and/or scattered light from the object under inspection, detecting means for detecting particles and/or defects based on a signal detected by the light detecting means, dimension measuring means for processing the signal detected by the light detecting means to measure the size of each particle and/or defect, data processing means for processing an inspection result, and display means for displaying information on the inspection result, wherein the data processing means relates a particle and/or defect size to a cause of failure to point out the cause of failure from statistical processing on the inspection result, and the display means displays information on the inspection result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In an aspect of the present invention, for example, the means for displaying information on the inspection result displays an occurrence frequency distribution of the particles or the pattern detects of respective sizes obtained by the dimension measuring means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, in another aspect of the present invention, the means for displaying information on the inspection result displays information on the particles and/or the pattern defects of a given range of size in a manner discriminative from information on the particles and/or the pattern defects of another range of size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, in a still another aspect of the present invention, management information is provided for each of the regions on the object under inspection. The management information is compared with the size of a particle and/or a pattern defect detected from each of the regions, and evaluation as to whether each of the regions on the object under inspection is defective or non-defective in quality is made, thereby conducting a failure analysis for each of the regions on the object under inspection. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In still other aspect of the present invention, the means for displaying information on the inspection result can display the yield impact, that is the influence of particles and/or pattern defects on a yield, based on the sizes of the particles and/or the pattern defects obtained by the dimension measuring means and information on defectiveness or non-defectiveness of electric characteristics, obtained from the electric inspection of the object under inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a particle/defect inspecting method for measuring an object under inspection in accordance with an optical approach to detect particles and/or defects thereon. The inspecting method includes a procedure for illuminating light to an object under inspection, a procedure for detecting reflected light and/or scattered light from the object under inspection, a procedure for detecting particles and/or defects based on a detected signal, a procedure for processing the detected signal to measure the size of each particle and/or defect, a data processing procedure for processing an inspection result, and a procedure for displaying information on the inspection result. The procedures are executed in this order to relates a particle and/or defect size to a cause of failure, wherein the data processing procedure points out a cause of failure from statistical processing on the inspection result to display information on the inspection result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In an aspect of the present invention, for example, when displaying information on the inspection result, an occurrence frequency distribution of respective sizes of the particles or the pattern detects obtained by the dimension measuring step is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further, in another aspect of the present invention, when displaying information on the inspection result, information on the particles and/or the pattern defects of a given range of size is displayed in a manner discriminative from information on the particles and/or the pattern defects of another range of size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further, in a still another aspect of the present invention, management information is provided for each of the regions on the object under inspection. The management information is compared with the size of a particle and/or a pattern defect detected from each of the regions, and evaluation as to whether each of the regions on the object under inspection is defective or non-defective in quality is made, thereby conducting a failure analysis for each of the regions on the object under inspection. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the following, each of embodiments according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Configuration and Operation of Apparatus for Inspecting Particles and/or Defects According to the Present Invention&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> First, the configuration and operation of an apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention when it is operated as a component of a system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> While the following description on the embodiment will be made on an example in which a semiconductor wafer is inspected for particles possibly attached thereon, the present invention can be applied to an apparatus for inspecting pattern defects other than particles. Also, the present invention is not limited to semiconductor wafers but can be applied to thin film substrates, photomasks, TFT, PDP and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention comprises an illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>; a detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>; a light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>; a signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>; a data display unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>; a stage assembly <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>; an auto-focus illumination unit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>; and an auto-focus light receiver unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> For conducting an inspection, an object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is placed on the stage assembly <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and irradiated by the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and scattered light from the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is condensed by the detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Then, the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> detects the scattered light from the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The scattered light detected by the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is opto-electrically transduced, and processed by the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to detect particles and measure their sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is moved in the horizontal direction by the stage assembly <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and also moved in the vertical direction by the auto-focus illumination unit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and auto-focus light receiver unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> such that the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is positioned at the focal point of the detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Thus, particles can be detected and their sizes be measured over the entire area of the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Then, the result of detection is displayed on the data display unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Here, the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is configured to irradiate the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with light, for example, from a laser light source such as Ar laser, semiconductor laser, YAG laser and UV laser, or a white light source such as an Xe lamp and Hg lamp, using a beam expander, a collimator lens, a cylindrical lens or the like. The illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is adjusted such that the light is irradiated at the focal point of the detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Here, for selecting an appropriate light source, a light source having a short wavelength is preferred as the illumination light source for improving the sensitivity for detecting particles, so that a YAG laser, Ar laser and UV laser are suitable. Alternatively, for reducing the size and cost of the apparatus, a semiconductor laser is suitable. Further alternatively, a white light source is suitable as the illumination light source for reducing interference by an optically transparent thin film which may be formed on an object under inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As to the shape of irradiating light, a circular illumination or a liner illumination may be used for irradiation. The illumination light may be or may not be collimated light. For increasing the amount of light on an object under inspection per unit area, the power of the illumination light source may be increased, or the illumination light may be illuminated with high numerical aperture (NA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Next, the detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has optical lenses configured such that from the light emitted-from the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, scattered light from the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is condensed on the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Also, the detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> also has the ability to optically process the scattered light, for example, make modification, adjustment and so on to the optical characteristics of the scattered light using a polarizer and a spatial filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> When a polarizer is used for optical processing, the polarizer is preferably set up in a direction in which P-polarized light is transmitted when S-polarized light is irradiated. On the other hand, the polarizer is preferably set up on a direction in which S-polarized light is transmitted when P-polarized light is irradiated. When a spatial filter is used, collimated light is suitably used as the illumination light for improving the performance of detecting particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is used to receive the scattered light condensed by the detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for opto-electrically transducing the scattered light, and is implemented, for example, by a TV camera, a CCD linear sensor, a TDI sensor, an anti-blooming TDI sensor, and a photomultiplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> For selecting a device for the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a photomultiplier is suitable in use for detecting feeble light. Alternatively, a TV camera is suitable for rapidly capturing a two-dimensional image. When the detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> comprises a focusing system, a TV camera, a CCD linear sensor, a TDI sensor, or an anti-blooming TDI sensor is suitable. When the detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> comprises a light condenser system, a photomultiplier may be used. In addition, when the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> receives light over a wide dynamic range, i.e., if the sensor is saturated by incident light, the sensor may be additionally provided with an anti-blooming function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Next, the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has a section for detecting particles, a section for measuring the size of a particle, and an output portion for outputting measured data to the data display unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and/or a network <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>. For detecting particles, the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, for example, binarizes an input signal, determines a signal equal to or larger than a binarization threshold as a particle, and outputs the result of determination. While the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> also measures particle sizes, details on associated processing will be described later. The stage assembly <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in turn has functions of, for example, moving the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the horizontal and vertical directions, and rotating the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The auto-focus illumination unit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> converges light emitted, for example, from a white light source such as an Hg lamp or a laser light source such as He-Ne onto the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Here, the wavelength of a light source used in the auto-focus illumination unit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is preferably different from that of a light source used in the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Next, the auto-focus light receiver unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is a section for receiving a portion of emitted from the auto-focus illumination unit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which is reflected from the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and may comprise a sensor capable of detecting the position of light, such as a position sensor. Information acquired by the auto-focus light receiver unit <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is sent to the stage assembly <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for controlling the stage. While in the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> illuminates the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from one direction, the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be configured to illuminate the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from two directions. Further, while the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has one each of the detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to detect the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in one direction, the inspection apparatus may comprise two or more sets of these components such that the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is detected in two or more directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Next, methods of setting conditions for detecting particles and/or defects when the particle size is employed in the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention will be described. There are some conditions required for setting, such as an optical condition and a condition in signal processing. In this embodiment, a method of setting an illumination source and an irradiation intensity will be described by way of an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Suppose that the amount of light reflected from circuit patterns printed on an object under inspection and then supplied to the light detector unit is proportional to the irradiation intensity of the illumination source in the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects. If the irradiation intensity of the illumination source is increased, the amount of the light reflected from the circuit patterns will increase, thereby saturating the opto-electrical transducing elements of the light detector unit. When the reflected light from the circuit patterns has saturated the light detector unit, a signal obtained from the circuit patterns will assume a value that saturates the light detector unit. Accordingly, regardless of the presence or absence of a particle on the circuit patterns, the value of the signal will remain the same. For this reason, no particles on the circuit patterns cannot be detected. In other words, if the irradiation intensity of the illumination source is increased, circuit patterns from which no particles can be detected will increase, thereby reducing the areas where particles can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The degree of a decrease in the areas where particles can be detected varies according to the reflectivities of materials employed for manufacture of the circuit patterns, complexity of a circuit pattern structure, and the optical processing method as well as the irradiation intensity of the illumination source. When the area from which particles can be detected varies according to the irradiation intensity of the illumination source in this way, a detection condition should be determined by using a graph illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>. First, description will be directed to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> is the graph which sets the minimum size of a particle to be detected on the horizontal axis, and a proportion of the area on which particles can be detected to the entire area of an object under inspection on the vertical axis. This embodiment shows the case where the area on which particles can be detected is decreased with an increase in the irradiation intensity of the illumination light source, though smaller particles can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A curve <highlight><bold>4101</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> shows proportions of areas to the entire object area, where detection of particles of sizes equal to or larger than those set on the horizontal axis is possible. In this embodiment, 0.1 &mgr;m on the horizontal axis represents a condition where a particle having a size equal to or more than 0.1 &mgr;m is detected. In this case, in order to allow particle detection, it is necessary to increase the irradiation intensity of the illumination light source. Thus, light reflected from a lot of circuit patterns saturates the light detector unit, so that the percentage of the area from which particles can be detected to the entire object area becomes 15%. Further, when a condition for detecting a particle having a size equal to or more than 1 &mgr;m is determined, particles can be detected even if the irradiation intensity of the illumination light source is small. Thus, the amount of light reflected from the circuit patterns is reduced, so that the number of the circuit patterns that bring about saturation of the light detector unit is reduced. Accordingly, particle detection is possible in 85% of the entire area of the object under inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The operator of the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention can determine a desired detection condition if he specifies the size of a particle to be detected or the percentage of a particle detectable area, from the graph in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>. If the operator specifies the percentage of the particle detectable area to be 50%, the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention automatically sets the irradiation intensity at which 0.65 &mgr;m particles can be detected. The relationship between the size of a particle to be detected and the irradiation intensity of the illumination light source should be measured in advance by the apparatus for inspecting particles and defects according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Since the shape of the curve <highlight><bold>4101</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> varies according to an object under inspection, measurement should be performed for each object under inspection. As a measuring method, the amount of light reflected from an object under inspection may actually be measured and then a saturation area may be thereby measured. Alternatively, design data may also be employed to calculate a saturation area if the saturation area can be anticipated from the design data on an object under inspection. The former method does not need the design data, so that it can be employed for measurement if only an object under inspection is available, while the latter method can set a detection condition in advance, so that it can reduce a condition setting time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In this example, description was given about the method of setting the condition of the irradiation intensity of the illumination light source based on the size of a particle to be detected. A method of changing a threshold value for signal processing based on the size of a particle to be detected may also be employed. In this case, suppose the apparatus for inspecting particles and defects where the irradiation intensity of the illumination light source is kept to be constant and detection of particles is made to be more difficult as the threshold value for particle detection is set to be larger, for example. Then, if only large particles have to be detected, the threshold should be set to be large, while on the contrary, if even small particles have to be detected, the threshold should be set to be small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Next, a system in semiconductor device manufacturing lines will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> shows semiconductor device manufacturing processes <highlight><bold>4401</bold></highlight>, an inspection process <highlight><bold>4402</bold></highlight>, inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>4403</bold></highlight> for inspecting particles and/or defects, a database <highlight><bold>4404</bold></highlight>, and measuring apparatuses <highlight><bold>4405</bold></highlight> for managing process states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>4403</bold></highlight> are the apparatuses for inspecting particles and defects according to the present invention, for example, for detecting particles and/or defects or classifying the particles and/or defects. The measuring apparatuses <highlight><bold>4405</bold></highlight> comprise, for example, an apparatus for determining defectiveness or non-defectiveness of a semiconductor device by means of an electric test, an apparatus for conducting a component analysis, an apparatus for measuring the thickness of a film applied onto a semiconductor device, an apparatus for measuring a pattern width formed on the semiconductor device, an apparatus for measuring electric conductivity between patterns, and a review apparatus for the particles and/or defects. The database <highlight><bold>4404</bold></highlight> stores the results of inspection by the inspection apparatuses <highlight><bold>4403</bold></highlight>, results of measurement by the measuring apparatuses <highlight><bold>4405</bold></highlight>, information on the semiconductor device manufacturing processes, and instances of the past defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Next, operations in the semiconductor device manufacturing system in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> will be described. First, semiconductor devices are manufactured in accordance with the semiconductor device manufacturing processes <highlight><bold>4401</bold></highlight>, undergoing respective processes included therein. During the course of the device manufacturing process, defect inspection is performed in the inspection process <highlight><bold>4402</bold></highlight>. If a defect is encountered, the result of inspection is compared with the information in the database <highlight><bold>4404</bold></highlight> and the results of measurement by the measuring apparatuses <highlight><bold>4405</bold></highlight>, and then countermeasures against the defect are fed back to the semiconductor device manufacturing processes <highlight><bold>4401</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a system which is configured using the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. Specifically, the system comprises the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> of the present invention; a data server <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>; a review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight>; an electric testing apparatus <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>; an analyzer <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight>; and a network <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight> for interconnecting the respective components. In this system, the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> is, for example, a measuring SEM; the electric testing apparatus <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> is a tester; and the analyzer <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight> is an apparatus for analyzing components of particles such as EDX. The data server <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> is a computer which can collect and accumulate inspection data from the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>; results of reviews from the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight>; results of tests from the electric testing apparatus <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>; and results of analyses from the analyzer <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight>. The network <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight> is a communication network, for example, based on the Ethernet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Next described will be the operation of the system using the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects. After an inspection has been made in the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, particles for which appropriate countermeasures should be taken are selected by a method as described later. Information indicative of necessity of the countermeasures is added to the result of inspection by the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, for example, serial numbers allocated to particles when they were detected, information on the positions of particles, information on the sizes of particles, and so on, and transmitted to the data server <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> through the network <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>. For adding the information indicative of necessity of the countermeasures, for example, a flag may be added to the result of detection to indicate whether or not appropriate countermeasures are required. Then, for investigating particles detected by the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> in greater detail, the object under testing is conveyed to the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight>. The object under testing may be manually conveyed or mechanically conveyed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> After the object under testing has been conveyed to the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight>, the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> accesses the data server <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> to receive the result of detection from the data server <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> through the network <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>. Then, a review is started using the received result of detection. In this event, the particles which require countermeasures are preferentially reviewed, using the information added by the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, thereby making it possible to rapidly analyze particles which can cause a failure. Similarly, the analyzer <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight> can also analyze preferentially the particles which require countermeasures based on the information added by the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, thereby making it possible to rapidly advance an analysis on the cause of a failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> These review data and result of analysis may be accumulated in the data server <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, such that they are matched with results of testing in the electric testing apparatus <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> to confirm whether or not a failure is eventually determined. If a failure is not eventually identified, the data server <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> transmits data for changing the criteria for selecting particles which require countermeasures to the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, so that the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> changes the criteria for determining whether or not countermeasures are required, thereby making it possible to more accurately select particles which require countermeasures and to readily take appropriate countermeasures to a failure in the semiconductor manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing description has been made for an example in which data is transmitted and received through a network, the transmission/reception of data need not be performed through a network, but data may be delivered through a removable recording medium or sheets of paper on which data are printed out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Next described will be another manner of using the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> according to the present invention in combination of the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> extracted therefrom. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, an inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> is, for example, the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects of the present invention, and a review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>, for example, a measuring SEM, reviews particles and/or defects on an object under inspection. Also, a network <highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight> transmits/receives data between the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> and the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>, and is implemented, for example, by a system connected through the Ethernet. Next, the operation will be described. It should be noted that in the following description, particles are taken as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> First, the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> inspects particles on an object under inspection, and adds, for example, serial numbers allocated to particles when they are detected, information on positions of particles, and information on sizes of particles to the result of inspection. The resultant inspection data is transmitted to the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> through the network <highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight>. After the object under inspection is conveyed to the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>, the particles are reviewed in the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>. In this event, a scaling factor for reviewing in the review apparatus may be adjusted in accordance with the information on the particle sizes measured by the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> to perform an efficient reviewing operation. Specifically, when the particle size information acquired from the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> shows a small particle, this particle is reviewed at a high scaling factor, so that details on the small particle can be rapidly observed. On the other hand, if the particle size information indicates a large particle, this particle is reviewed at a low scaling factor, so that the large particle can be reviewed without extending off a review screen, thereby making it possible to rapidly observe an entire image of the particle. For example, when the inspection data transmitted from the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> indicates a particle, the size of which is 0.1 &mgr;m, this particle is reviewed by adjusting the scaling factor such that the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> covers a field of view which spans 1 &mgr;m. On the other hand, when a particle has a size of 10 &mgr;m, the scaling factor is adjusted such that the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> covers a field of view which spans 100 &mgr;m. In this way, the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> allows the user to efficiently review small particles to large particles to rapidly analyze detected particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, description was directed to the case where particle size information is supplied from the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> to change the scaling factor of the reviewing apparatus. As an alternative method, the scaling factor of the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> and information on the field of view may also be added to the inspection data. In this embodiment, though a reviewing operation at scaling of &times;100 on particles by the reviewing apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> was described, other scaling factor may also be employed. Further, if the accuracy of position information on the particles by the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> is known, the reviewing operation may also be performed at a scaling factor determined both by the factor based on the particle size information and the accuracy of the position information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, though description was made where the length measuring SEM was employed as the reviewing apparatus, a reviewing SEM or an optical microscope system may also be employed. This technique can be applied to any apparatus for reviewing or any function of reviewing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> This embodiment has been described for an example in which particle size information is outputted from the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight>, and the scaling factor is adjusted in accordance with the size information in the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>. As an alternative method, information on the review scaling factor and the field of view for reviewing in the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> may be added to the inspection data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Also, this embodiment has been described for an example in which a particle is reviewed in the field of view which spans an area ten times wider than the size of the particle by adjusting the review scaling factor for the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>. However, the scaling factor may be any other value. Also, if the accuracy of particle position information is known in the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight>, a particle may be reviewed at a scaling factor based on the particle size information in consideration of the accuracy of the position information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Further, while this embodiment has been described for an example in which a particle is reviewed by the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>, the foregoing approach may be applied when a particle is reviewed by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Measurement of Size of Particle&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made on the processing for measuring the size of a particle using the method and apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B</cross-reference> are a diagram showing image data when a particle exists, and a diagram showing a distribution of intensity when particle data is measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C are diagrams for comparing distributions of two types of intensitys, and an explanatory diagram for showing how a maximum is calculated for the intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows an example of image processed by the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> when a particle exists, where particle data <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be seen in a central portion of the image. The particle data <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is outputted from the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and captured by the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as data having a contrast value. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> in a three-dimensional representation, where x- and y-axes are coordinate axes for determining a position within the image, and z-axis represents the intensity. Intensitys are plotted at corresponding positions, and connected by lines. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B, a</cross-reference> waveform <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> indicates waveform data of the particle data <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. This waveform <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be approximated to a Gaussian distribution from the nature of the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the detection optical system <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and the width and height of the Gaussian distribution vary depending on the size of a particle on the object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Further, the width and height of the distribution also vary depending on the intensity of the laser illumination used in the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the shape of a distribution and the amount of feature may have been previously measured for a variety of standard particles using the inspection apparatus of the present invention configured as described above, such that the detected waveform <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is compared with the results of measurements made on the standard particles to acquire information on the size of the detected particle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> A method of comparing the waveform <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the particle with the waveforms of the standard particles may involve previously measuring the total sum (integral) of the intensitys in the region occupied by the particle data <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, i.e., data on the volume of the waveform <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and comparing the volume data of the particle data <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> with the volume data of the standard particles. However, if the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> differs in intensity when the standard particles are measured and when particles on the object under inspection are measured, the respective volume data are divided by the intensities of the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for normalization, or the volume data of the particle data <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> or the standard particles is multiplied by the ratio of intensities to correct the volume data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As an alternative method of comparing waveforms, a maximum intensity value in the waveform <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> or the width of the waveform <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be compared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Further, in addition to the volume data, the number of pixels on the images of signals indicating the standard particles and particles may also be employed. This method will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A and 42B</cross-reference>. Like <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</cross-reference> shows the image of a particle, and particle data <highlight><bold>4201</bold></highlight> represents the signal of the particle obtained from light reflected from the particle. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</cross-reference> is a diagram showing contrast values of the particle data <highlight><bold>4201</bold></highlight>, and a particle signal portion <highlight><bold>4202</bold></highlight> represents the signal of the particle. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A and 42B</cross-reference>, the volume data is the total sum of the contrast values of respectivverticalxels, so that the value of the volume data is <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight>. Further, the number of thverticalxels on the image is the number of thverticalxels within the particle signal portion <highlight><bold>4202</bold></highlight>. Thus, the number of thverticalxels on the image is <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> pixels, and the width of the signal is 5 pixels in the x direction and 5 pixels in the y direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> A method of calculating a maximum intensity value will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference> show exemplary waveforms of particle data, similar to the waveform <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows an example in which a signal waveform of particle data acquired by the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is in the shape of pinnacle having a peak, indicating that the signal does not reach a saturation region of the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> in turn shows an exemplary signal waveform of particle data which presents a plateau shape at the peak, indicating that the signal reaches the saturation region of the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and does not include data exceeding the saturation region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The maximum intensity value is defined as the value which is determined as maximum as a result of comparison between intensitys at respectivverticalxels of the waveform, when particle data draws a signal waveform as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, i</cross-reference>.e., a intensity at the peak point <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when particle data draws a signal waveform as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B, a</cross-reference> calculation is performed as described below to find a maximum intensity value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> First, in the saturation region <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, maximum lengths of the saturation region are calculated in the x- and y-directions, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> shows a cross-section of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> taken along the maximum length region. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, the horizontal axis is a coordinate axis representing the position in the maximum length region, while the vertical axis is a coordinate axis representing the intensity. The intensity <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> indicates the saturation level of the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. On this cross-section, three or more unsaturated signals <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are selected. Here, description is made on the assumption that three points are selected. As points to be selected, three points having the largest intensitys are selected from unsaturated signals on the cross-section. Assuming that the three points are at coordinates x<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, x<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, x<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and have intensitys z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, z<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, z<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively, equations representing Gaussian distributions are derived using unknown numbers k, &sgr;, u: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Next, another embodiment for calculating the maximum intensity value will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>C are a graph showing a signal distribution of particle data which presents a plateau shape at the peak; a diagram showing the shape of the saturated signal portion; and an explanatory diagram for explaining how the maximum intensity value is calculated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference> shows the relationship between a signal waveform <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> and a peak region <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, wherein the peak region <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> in the signal waveform <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> does not include data exceeding the saturated level since the peak region <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight> reaches the saturation region of the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</cross-reference> shows a cross-section of the signal waveform <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight>, where the vertical axis represents the intensity, and the horizontal axis represents thverticalxel position in the signal. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B, a</cross-reference> saturation level <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight> indicates the saturation level of the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and a signal width <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> indicates the width of the peak region <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>. Also, a intensity <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight> is a maximum intensity value which is generated when an unsaturable detector is used for the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Next explained is a method of calculating the maximum intensity value <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight> from the saturated signal waveform <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight>. Assuming that the saturation level <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight> is represented by SL; the signal width <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> by SW, and the intensity <highlight><bold>1705</bold></highlight> by PL, the illustrated waveform is approximated to a Gaussian distribution to derive the following equations: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>SL&equals;k</italic></highlight>/&sgr;&middot;exp(&minus;(&minus;<highlight><italic>SW/</italic></highlight>2)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/(2&middot;&sgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>PL&equals;k/&sgr;</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> where k is a coefficient, and &sgr; is a value calculated from the configuration of the optical system in the apparatus for inspecting particles and defects of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Therefore, from the two equations, PL is calculated as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>PL&equals;SL</italic></highlight>/exp(&minus;(&minus;<highlight><italic>SW/</italic></highlight>2)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/(2&middot;&sgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Here, since SL indicates the output of the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> when it is saturated, SL represents <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> gradation levels when an A/D converter of the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has a 8-bit resolution. &sgr; is given a value from zero to one depending on the configuration of the optical system. Next, a method of calculating SW will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</cross-reference> shows the shape of the peak region <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, in other words, a region in which the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is saturated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</cross-reference> includes a saturation region <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> and a signal width <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight>. Since the signal waveform <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> is regarded as a Gaussian distribution, the saturation region <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> can be assumed to be circular. Therefore, assuming that the signal width <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> is represented by SW, and the saturation region <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> by SA, SW is calculated by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>SW&equals;</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2&middot;{square root}{square root over ((<highlight><italic>SA</italic></highlight>/&pgr;))}</bold></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In the above equation, {square root}(A) represents a calculation of a square root of A, and &pgr; is the Ludolphian number. The saturation region <highlight><bold>1706</bold></highlight> may be comprised of the number of pixels in which the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is saturated. Here, a saturated pixel may be represented by a maximum of the output from the A/D converter of the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and may be set in consideration of electric noise in the light detector unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. For example, when the A/D converter has an 8-bit resolution, the output represents a maximum of 255 gradation levels. It may be thought that the output at 245th gradational level or higher is saturated if electric noise accounts for 10 gradation levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> If the signal waveform <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> is not saturated, a similar calculation may be performed using a maximum of the signal waveform <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> as the saturation level <highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Since the maximum intensity value can be calculated from the foregoing process, the size of a detected particle can be measured by comparing the values calculated using the standard particles with a value calculated using the detected particle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing description has been made for the maximum intensity value as an example, the integral of intensity over particle data may be used instead of the maximum intensity value. In this case, the integral of intensity over particle data may be calculated by adding contrast values of respectivverticalxels in the detected particle signal. The advantage of using the integral is to allow reduction in the sampling error of a signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> A method of correcting intensity when the integral of intensity is employed will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a three-dimensional representation of the Gaussian distribution. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference> is the case where the signal is saturated when Y&equals;Y<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. The method to be described below is the one for calculating the intensity of the entire Gaussian distribution when the intensity of a V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> portion, or a portion below a line indicating Y&equals;Y<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> First, assume that the total volume of the entire Gaussian distribution is represented by V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>, the volumes above and below the line indicating Y&equals;Y<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>are represented by V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively. Then, also assume that the shape of a section through the X axis of the Gaussian distribution in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference> is obtained from: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Y</italic></highlight>&equals;exp(&minus;<highlight><italic>X</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/2/&sgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> At this point, through integration with respect to the Y axis, V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is expressed by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;2&middot;&pgr;&sgr;<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Further, V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is expressed by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;2&middot;&pgr;&middot;&sgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>(<highlight><italic>Y</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&middot;Log(<highlight><italic>Y</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>)&plus;1<highlight><italic>&minus;Y</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Log&rdquo; in the above equation indicates calculation of the natural logarithm. If a volume ratio V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is expressed as CC, CC can be calculated from: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>CC&equals;V</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/(<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&minus;<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Thus, using the above equation, CC is calculated from: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>CC&equals;</italic></highlight>1/(<highlight><italic>Y</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&middot;(<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&minus;Log(<highlight><italic>Y</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>))). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Since Y<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&equals;exp(&minus;SW<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/2/&sgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), CC can be expressed as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>CC&equals;</italic></highlight>1/exp (&minus;<highlight><italic>SW</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/2/&sgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)/(1&plus;<highlight><italic>SW</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/2/&sgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, if the obtained intensity is V<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the entire intensity V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be calculated from: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;<highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&middot;1/exp(&minus;<highlight><italic>SW</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/2/&sgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)/(1<highlight><italic>&plus;SW</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/2/&sgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Correction of the intensity can be thereby performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Also, while the foregoing embodiment employs an 8-bit A/D converter, an A/D converter having 10 bits or more may be used. Use of the A/D converter having a lot of bits is advantageous in that it can capture a slight change in the intensity of light received at the light detector unit. Thus, more accurate calculation of the size of a particle and/or a defect can be thereby performed. Further, while the foregoing embodiment has been described for an example of calculating the signal width <highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight> as the diameter of a circle, a width of the saturation region which indicates a maximum length or a minimum length may be used instead of the diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In the description on the configuration of the apparatus, the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> uses laser light as an example in the foregoing embodiment. Alternatively, white light may be used instead of laser light. Also, when an object under testing has repeated circuit patterns, the foregoing measurement of the size may be made after taking a difference between an image of the repeated pattern on which no particle exists and an image of the same on which a particle exists. Also, irrespective of the presence or absence of repeated patterns, if data on scattered light or data on reflectivity associated with the circuit pattern or a film, for example, an oxide film or a metal film, can be acquired beforehand, such data may be used to correct data on the size of a particle on the circuit pattern or the film. Furthermore, while the foregoing embodiment measures the particle size by comparing it with the sizes of standard particles, the size of the particle may be compared with a particle, the size of which is known, instead of the standard particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Next, an exemplary method of calculating a particle size from the maximum intensity value will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> when using data on a particle, the size of which is known. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a graph in which the horizontal axis represents a maximum intensity value of particle acquired from the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention, and the vertical axis represents the particle size. Here, the maximum intensity values of particles are calculated by the aforementioned method, while the size of a particle is derived by measuring a horizontal dimension and a vertical dimension of the particle using a review apparatus such as a measuring SEM, multiplying the horizontal dimension by the vertical dimension, and taking a square root of the product. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> plot point <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> indicates data on a particle, so that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> indicates data on a plurality of particles. An approximate curve <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> is calculated by a least-square method based on the data at the plot points <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight>. In this event, the approximate curve can be expressed by an equation y&equals;a&middot;x&plus;b when the horizontal axis of the graph is represented by x, and the vertical axis of the same by y, where, a and b are values found by a least-square method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> For calculating a particle size from a maximum intensity value, a relational expression between the maximum intensity value and the particle size is found and is used to calculate the particle size from the maximum intensity value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation will be described. First, the approximate curve <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> has been previously calculated by the aforementioned method. Next, an object under inspection is inspected using the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. Then, a maximum intensity value for the particle is calculated as described above during the inspection. In this event, using the approximate curve, the maximum intensity value is substituted into x of the approximate curve to calculate y which is determined as the particle size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Examples of the results calculated by the foregoing method are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A, 30B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A, 30B</cross-reference> are graphs, wherein the horizontal axis represents the particle size calculated from signal outputted from the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention, and the vertical axis represents the particle size measured by a measuring SEM. A plot point <highlight><bold>3101</bold></highlight> corresponds to information on one particle. A straight line <highlight><bold>3102</bold></highlight> in turn represents an approximate line when each of plot points <highlight><bold>3101</bold></highlight> is least-mean-square approximated, and a value <highlight><bold>3103</bold></highlight> indicates a correlation value at the plot point <highlight><bold>3101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</cross-reference> shows the result of measuring sizes of particles detected on a wafer having a one-layer pattern, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</cross-reference> shows, by way of example, the result of measuring sizes of particles detected on a wafer having a multi-layer pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> shows, by way of example, SEM photographs of used particles in addition to the particle sizes calculated from signals outputted from the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention on the horizontal axis, and the particle sizes measured by the measuring SEM on the vertical axis, in a manner similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A, 30B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> While this embodiment calculates a square root of the vertical dimension and the horizontal dimension of each particle, the size of a particle may be defined as the larger one of the vertical dimension and the horizontal dimension of the particle, or an average value of the vertical dimension and the horizontal dimension of the particle. Alternatively, the major axis of a particle may be used, or the minor axis of the particle may be used. Further, the approximate curve may be a first-order curve, i.e., a straight line, or a higher-order curve, a logarithmic curve or an exponential curve, or a combination of a plurality of curves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> If the provision of different approximate curves for respective shapes of particles results in a better correlation of the particle sizes calculated as described above to the particle sizes measured using the measuring SEM, a different approximate curve may be used for each shape of particle. Here, the difference in the shape of a particle refers to, for example, the difference between a spherical particle and a flat plate-shaped particle, or the difference between a particle and a scratch, when the difference lies in the ratio of the particle size measured from above to the particle size measured from the side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Now, a method of distinguishing a particle from a scratch will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A, 18B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference> illustrates the configuration for discriminating between a particle and a scratch, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</cross-reference> shows how they are discriminated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference> comprises a substrate <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight>; a particle <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>; vertical-illumination light <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight> which illuminates the substrate from a perpendicular direction; oblique illumination light <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight>; a light detector <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight>; a storage circuit <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight>; and a comparator circuit <highlight><bold>1807</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated configuration, the vertical-illumination light <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight> is emitted to the substrate at an angle close to a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight>, while the oblique illumination light <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> is emitted to the substrate <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight> at an angle close to a direction horizontal to the substrate <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight>. Their light sources may be an Ar laser, a YAG laser, or the like, by way of example. The light detector <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight>, in turn, may be a TV camera, a CCD linear sensor, a TDI sensor, or a photomultiplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation will be described. A particle or a scratch is irradiated with the vertical-illumination light <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight> to detect scattered light from the particle or scratch by the light detector <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight>. The amount of scattered light is stored in the storage circuit <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the irradiation of the vertical-illumination light <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight> is stopped, and the oblique illumination light <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> is irradiated to the particle or scratch to detect scattered light from the particle or scratch by the light detector <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight>. The amount of scattered light is stored in the storage circuit <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight>. Next, the light intensities, or the amounts of scattered light stored in the storage circuit <highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight> are compared by the comparator circuit <highlight><bold>1807</bold></highlight>. The comparator circuit <highlight><bold>1807</bold></highlight> calculates the ratio of the amount of scattered light when the vertical-illumination light <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight> is irradiated to the amount of scattered light when the oblique illumination light <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> is irradiated, and compares the ratio with a previously determined threshold to determine a particle or a scratch. A determination method used herein may take advantage of the fact that a particle has a smaller ratio of the amounts of scattered light, and a scratch has a larger ratio, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Next, a method of setting the threshold for discriminating between a particle and a scratch will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A</cross-reference> is a graph in which the amount of scattered light caused by the vertical-illumination light is plotted on the horizontal axis and the amount of scattered light caused by the oblique illumination light is plotted on the vertical axis. In this embodiment, discrimination between a particle and a scratch is made in advance, and a particle is indicated by &xcirc;, while a scratch is indicated by &utrif;. Next, by adding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A</cross-reference> a discrimination line <highlight><bold>4601</bold></highlight> for discriminating between a particle and a scratch, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46B</cross-reference> is obtained. This discrimination line <highlight><bold>4601</bold></highlight> represents thresholds for discriminating between particles and scratches. Incidentally, the discrimination line <highlight><bold>4601</bold></highlight> may be arbitrarily set by the operator, or may be automatically calculated. Automatic calculation of the discrimination line <highlight><bold>4601</bold></highlight> is advantageous in that, even if different operators perform the setting operation, the same threshold can be set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Next, a method of automatically calculating the discrimination threshold will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46C</cross-reference>. First, an approximate line <highlight><bold>4602</bold></highlight> is calculated from particle data. This approximate line <highlight><bold>4602</bold></highlight> is expressed by: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In the above equation, X represents the horizontal axis of the graph, while Y represents the vertical axis of the graph, and a and b are values obtained through the least-square method. Next, an approximate line <highlight><bold>4603</bold></highlight> is calculated from scratch data. As in the case of using the particle data, the approximate line <highlight><bold>4603</bold></highlight> is expressed by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Y&equals;c&middot;X&plus;d </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> where c and d are values obtained through the least- square method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Then, the discrimination threshold should be calculated from an intermediate line <highlight><bold>4604</bold></highlight> between the two approximate lines from: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Y&equals;</italic></highlight>((<highlight><italic>a&plus;c</italic></highlight>)/2)&middot;<highlight><italic>X</italic></highlight>&plus;((<highlight><italic>b&plus;d</italic></highlight>)/2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, though a linear threshold is taken as an example of the discrimination threshold, a curvilinear threshold may also be employed, and a plurality of curves may be combined for calculating the discrimination threshold. Further, suppose that three or more types of objects are present for inspection. When discrimination among a particle, a scratch, and a pattern defect are to be made, for example in this case, a plurality of thresholds should be set for discrimination. Further, in this embodiment, though the case where two characteristic amounts, or the amount of scattered light caused by the vertical-illumination light and the amount of scattered light caused by the oblique illumination light are used for determination was described, the characteristic amount other than the amount of scattered light may also be used. If three or more characteristic amounts are obtained, a plurality of graphs may be employed for determination, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A and 47B</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A and 47B</cross-reference>, by additionally displaying a correct answering rate <highlight><bold>4701</bold></highlight> for discrimination in each of the graphs, the performance of the applied discrimination threshold may also be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, description was directed to an example where the result of determination by the review apparatus in advance is employed. However, if the discrimination threshold can be calculated from a past example in advance, the past example may also be used for determination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Next, a method of calculating a particle size when there are a plurality of approximate curves will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> comprises a storage unit <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight> for storing a maximum of detected signals; a discrimination unit <highlight><bold>1902</bold></highlight> for discriminating between a particle and a scratch; a conversion curve selection unit <highlight><bold>1903</bold></highlight>; and a particle size calculation unit <highlight><bold>1904</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation will be described. First, a conversion equation for calculating a particle size from a maximum intensity value using the aforementioned method has been created for each of a particle and a scratch in the apparatus of inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention and stored in the conversion curve selection unit <highlight><bold>1903</bold></highlight>. Next, a wafer is inspected by the inspection apparatus. In this event, a maximum intensity value of a detected substance is stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight>. Next, the discrimination unit <highlight><bold>1902</bold></highlight> determines whether the detected substance is a particle or a scratch by the aforementioned method. Based on this determination, a conversion curve is selected from the conversion curve selection unit <highlight><bold>1903</bold></highlight>, and the selected conversion curve and the maximum intensity value stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight> are inputted to the particle size calculation unit <highlight><bold>1904</bold></highlight> to calculate the size of the particle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Details of the method of creating a conversion curve will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48A and 48B</cross-reference>. First, data on the amount of scattered light detected from a detected substance by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention is stored. Then, the detected substance is reviewed by the review apparatus to determine whether the substance is a particle and/or a defect, and then the size of the detected substance is measured. Next, a graph where the intensity of the scattered light and the size of the detected substance are plotted is created for each particle and each defect. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48A and 48B</cross-reference> are examples of the graphs thus created. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48A</cross-reference> is a graph created when the detected substance is a particle, and only the particle data is plotted therein. The graph sets the amount of scattered light from the particle on the horizontal axis and sets on the vertical axis the size of the particle measured by the review apparatus. Further, an approximate curve <highlight><bold>4801</bold></highlight> is the one calculated from the data plotted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>A, and is the straight line calculated through the least-square method, for example. Likewise, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</cross-reference> is a graph created when the detected substance is a defect, and only the defect data is plotted therein. Further, an approximate curve <highlight><bold>4802</bold></highlight> is the one calculated from the defect data, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> If these approximate curves <highlight><bold>4801</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4802</bold></highlight> calculated according to the above-mentioned method are set as conversion lines, and if in the subsequent inspection, the size of a particle and/or a defect is calculated using the conversion curves set as described above, the size of the particle or the defect can be calculated with good accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing embodiment has described for an example in which a conversion curve is set according to the shape of a particle and a defect, a different approximate curve may be used according to the position on an object under inspection at which a particle is detected, for example, whether a particle on a circuit pattern or a particle on a region without patterns. Alternatively, a different approximate curve may be used depending on the surface state of an object under inspection, for example, whether the surface is coated with an aluminum film or a tungsten film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Method of Calibrating Measured Particle Size&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Next described will be a method of calibrating a particle size measured by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. This calibration may be used, for example, when the amount of illumination light has changed due to a deterioration in the illumination optical system in the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> An exemplary calibrating method will be described. First, mirror wafers with standard particles having known sizes attached thereto is prepared as calibration wafers. Two or more types of standard particles are preferably prepared. For example, a standard particle of 0.2 &mgr;m and a standard particle of 0.6 &mgr;m are attached to mirror wafers, respectively. Next, these wafers are inspected by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention to display the sizes of detected particles. In this event, if the inspection apparatus does not fail, peaks will appear at 0.2 &mgr;m and 0.6 &mgr;m on the scale of the histogram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a graph showing the number of detected particles on the vertical axis, and sizes of the detected particles on the horizontal axis. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the number of detected particles is increased at 0.2 &mgr;m and 0.6 &mgr;m on the scale. In contrast to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows an example when the laser light source used in the illumination optical system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has deteriorated to reduce the amount of illumination light to one half, wherein the number of detected particles is increased at 0.1 &mgr;m and 0.3 &mgr;m on the scale. In other words, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows an example in which a reduced amount of illumination light results in a less amount of scattered light, so that particle sizes are measured smaller than correct values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Next explained will be a method of calculating a calibration coefficient for calibrating the inspection apparatus. Assume first that the size of the standard particle inspected above is SS, and the size of a particle measured by the inspection apparatus of the present invention is IS. In this event, since a reduced amount of illumination light is calculated from the ratio of SS to IS, the calibration coefficient, designated VR, is calculated by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>VR&equals;SS/IS </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the calibration may be accomplished by increasing the amount of illumination light by a factor of VR or by multiplying a conversion equation for calculating the a particle size from the amount of scattered light by VR. Specifically, in the aforementioned example, assuming that the size SS of the standard particle is 0.2 &mgr;m and the size IS of the particle measured by the inspection apparatus is 0.1 &mgr;m, the calibration coefficient VR is calculated as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>VR&equals;2 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> so that the amount of illumination light may be increased twice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing example has employed a wafer with a standard particle of a known size attached thereto as a calibration wafer, the calibration wafer is only required to have a particle and/or a defect of known size attached thereto, so that a wafer having a defect of known size intentionally created therein may be used instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Next, another calibration method will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> This is a method which uses values measured by the review apparatus as particle sizes. First, an inspection is made in the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, and information on selected particles is added to the results of inspection by the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, for example, serial numbers allocated to particles when they were detected, information on the positions of the particles, information on the sizes of the particles, and so on, and transmitted to the data server <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> through the network <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>. After the wafer has been conveyed to the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight>, the wafer is reviewed by the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight>, and information on particle sizes measured therein is added to the inspection result. Here, the particle size information is derived, when using, for example, a measuring SEM as the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight>, by measuring the horizontal dimension and vertical dimension of a particle using the measuring SEM, multiplying the horizontal dimension by the vertical dimension, and taking a square root of the product. Next, the information added to the inspection result is transmitted to the data server <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, and the added information is received by the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> to calibrate the particle size information outputted from the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> based on the size information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The calibration method will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> is a graph showing the information on the size of each particle measured by the particle inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> on the horizontal axis, and the information on the size measured by the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> on the vertical axis. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28, a</cross-reference> plot point <highlight><bold>2901</bold></highlight> indicates information on the size of the same particle, so that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> plots information on a plurality of particles. Here, if the particle sizes are correctly measured, plot points <highlight><bold>2901</bold></highlight> should be arranged along a straight line <highlight><bold>2902</bold></highlight>. The calibration method first finds an approximate line for the data of the plot points <highlight><bold>2901</bold></highlight> through a least-square method or the like. This approximate line is the straight line <highlight><bold>2903</bold></highlight> which is expressed by an equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>y&equals;a&middot;x&plus;b </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> where x represents the particle size measured by the inspection apparatus on the horizontal axis, and y represents the size of the particle measured by the review apparatus <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> on the vertical axis. Also, a and b are values found by a least-square method. Next, the particle is inspected by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention, the size of the particle is measured, and the measured size is substituted into x in the above equation. The resulting value y is determined as the size of the particle after calibration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> While the linear approximation has been described as the calibration method, the approximation may be made to a higher order curve, a logarithmic curve, an exponential curve, or a combination of curves. In addition, a wafer for use in calibrating the particle size is not limited to one, but a plurality of wafers may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing description, particles are inspected using scattered light. This method is advantageous in that particles can be efficiently found. Also advantageously, when particle sizes are calculated by the aforementioned method, particles can be found without requiring a special light source for measuring the sizes, and measurements of the sizes can be made with scattered light from the same light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Analysis on Cause of Failure and Display of Result&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made on a procedure for analyzing a cause of failure and a procedure for displaying the result of analysis to the user when particle sizes are measured using the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C are diagrams showing that the relationship between particle sizes and the number of detected particles changes due to a cause of failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a line graph showing the number of detected particles and particle sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a histogram showing the number of detected particles and particle sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A, 8B</cross-reference> are schematic diagrams each clearly showing particles of a particular size on a wafer; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C are graphs each showing a transition of the number of detected particles for each particular size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a screen for displaying to the user a cause by which particles are generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a histogram showing the number of detected particles and the particle sizes on a plurality of wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is another histogram separately showing detected particles and scratches on a wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> One important idea of the present invention is to use particle size information for analyzing a cause of failure. The following description will be made on the effectiveness of using the particle size information for analyzing a cause of failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Assume herein that particles have been detected from a wafer processed by a semiconductor manufacturing apparatus, for example, an etching apparatus, and the relationship between particle sizes and the number of detected particles are as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C. A region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows a distribution of particles steadily generated in a process of an etching apparatus. In this case, the particle sizes concentrate in a range from a to b, so that a gently-sloping mountain is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows an exemplary distribution of particles which are generated when the apparatus is faulty. In this case, large particles (a range of sizes larger than c) are frequently generated as shown in a region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, in addition to the particles in the steady state shown in the region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that the cause for such large particles is deposits on the inner wall surface of the etching apparatus are peeled off the wall surface during the etching process. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> also shows an exemplary distribution of particles which are generated when a failure occurs. In this case, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> shows that particle sizes also concentrate in a range from d to e in addition to the particles in the steady state. It is contemplated that the cause for such particles is particular patterns which are peeled off and dispersed during the etching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> As described above, in manufacturing apparatuses for semiconductor or the like, there is a relationship between the sizes of generated particles and the cause by which the particles are generated, so that the cause for particles generated in a certain manufacturing apparatus can be immediately known by managing the generation of particles of particular sizes. In other words, by investigating the relationship between the size of particles and the number of generated particles, the cause of failure can be revealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the values a-e of course depend on particular manufacturing apparatuses, manufacturing processes and so on. Also, particles generated by a different cause may exhibit a different distribution of size, so that it is preferred to prepare data which conforms to a particle size distribution for each cause. In addition, while this embodiment intends to identify the cause for generated particles in two ranges, the range of particle size may be divided into more than two ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made on a specific function of analyzing a cause of failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> First described is how the particle sizes and the number of detected particles are displayed on the data display unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The data display unit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> displays a graph showing a particle size distribution as described above, i.e., a graph which allows the user to understand the relationship between particle sizes and the number of detected particles. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a graph showing the particle size on the horizontal axis and the number of detected particles on the vertical axis. A point <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> indicates the number of detected particles of certain size. In this exemplary graph, data on the number of detected particles is provided in increments of 0.1 &mgr;m. A curve <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is a line connecting the points <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. By displaying the graph as in this embodiment, it can be immediately seen how particles detected from an object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are distributed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> In the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> minimum value on the horizontal axis may be a minimal detectable dimension of the particle inspection apparatus, or a particle size which should be managed on a semiconductor manufacturing line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> The particle size which should be managed on the semiconductor manufacturing line is hereinafter referred to as a management particle size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Also, the scale may be represented in a logarithmic or linear form. The unit of scale may be variable. Further, a displayed range of each axis may be fixed or variable. For example, particles generated by a particular cause alone may be displayed by displaying particles of a particular size. The contents represented on the vertical axis and the horizontal axis may be replaced with each other. Instead of the number of detected particles, the density of particles may be shown. Further, while this embodiment displays a graph, an average value of the graph, and a standard deviation or variance of the graph may also be displayed other than the graph. Also, while this embodiment displays particle data on one wafer as one graph, the graph need not be displayed for only one wafer. An average value, a standard deviation and a variance of particle data on a plurality of wafers may be displayed, and particle data on a plurality of wafers may be displayed side by side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> The graph may be displayed in histogram as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 32</cross-reference>. The graphs on these figures indicate the particle size on the horizontal axis, and the number of detected particles on the vertical axis, similarly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. These graphs display the particle size on the horizontal line divided into certain sections. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows data sections in increments of 0.2 &mgr;m. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> in turn shows data sections in increments of 0.1 &mgr;m, wherein particles having the size equal to or more than 5 &mgr;m are counted in a bar graph <highlight><bold>3301</bold></highlight>, and a histogram for particles having the size smaller than 1.1 &mgr;m and a histogram for particles having the size equal to or larger than 1.1 &mgr;m are displayed in different colors, by way of example. In addition, a function may be added for displaying information on the positions of a detected particles in a selected portion of a bar graph. Also, a review image may be displayed for the detected particles in the selected portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> shows another example of graphical representation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> shows an example in which the particle size is set on the horizontal axis, and an accumulated number of particles is set on the vertical axis. Here, the accumulated number refers to the number of detected particles of a certain size or larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> shows a further example of graphical representation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> shows an example in which the particle size is set on the horizontal axis, and the number of detected particles is set on the vertical axis, with a curve <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> indicative of the number of detected particles, and an equation expressing the curve <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> indicative of the number of detected particles additionally indicated in the graph. In the equation <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight>, x represents the particle size, and y the number of detected particles. The equation <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight> is an approximate equation derived from the number of detected particles for each particle size. The curve <highlight><bold>3601</bold></highlight> represents the equation <highlight><bold>3602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> shows a further example of graphical representation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> is the graph which sets the particle size on the horizontal axis, and sets the detected particle quantity rate on the vertical axis, with a broken-line graph <highlight><bold>3501</bold></highlight> indicative of the detected particle quantity rate and a particle size <highlight><bold>3502</bold></highlight> indicative of the particle size with the maximum particle quantity rate additionally indicated in the graph. The detected particle quantity rate is the proportion of the number of detected particles for each size to the total number of the particles detected by inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> shows a still another example of graphical representation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> sets the particle size on the horizontal axis, and sets the accumulated number of particles on the vertical axis, with a curve <highlight><bold>3701</bold></highlight> indicative of the accumulated number of particles, a straight line <highlight><bold>3702</bold></highlight> indicative of the position of the management particle size on the semiconductor device manufacturing line, and a value <highlight><bold>3703</bold></highlight> of the management particle size, additionally indicated in the graph. The accumulated number of particles is herein defined as the total number of particles of each size or smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> shows a still further example of graphical representation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> sets the particle size on the horizontal axis, and the accumulated particle quantity ratio on the vertical axis on the vertical axis, with a curve <highlight><bold>3801</bold></highlight> indicative of the accumulated particle quantity ratio, particle quantity ratios <highlight><bold>3802</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3803</bold></highlight> in regard to the particles of certain sizes or larger, additionally indicated in the graph. The accumulated particle quantity ratio is herein defined as the ratio of the number of particles of each size or smaller to the total number of particles detected by inspection. Further, the particle quantity ratios <highlight><bold>3802</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3803</bold></highlight> are the ratios of the number of particles of certain sizes or larger to the total number of particles detected by inspection. The particle quantity ratio <highlight><bold>3802</bold></highlight> indicates that the ratio of particles of 0.5 &mgr;m or larger to the total number of detected particles is one, or indicates that all the detected particles are 0.5 &mgr;m or larger in size. The particle quantity ratio <highlight><bold>3803</bold></highlight> indicates that the ratio of particles of 1.0 &mgr;m or larger to the total number of detected particles is 0.45, or indicates that 45% of all the detected particles are the ones of 1.0 &mgr;m or larger. </paragraph>

While the example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> displays data for one wafer, data on a plurality of wafers may be displayed side by side as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is an example in which the number of detected particle is set on one of three coordinate axes; the particle size on another axis; and the wafer number on the remaining axis. In this example, data sections for the particle size are set in increments of 0.1 &mgr;m from zero to 1 &mgr;m, particles having sizes equal to or larger than 1 &mgr;m are counted on the same bar graph, and the total number of detected particles is also displayed in the graph.

<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Though the above descriptions were directed to the graphs showing the relationships between the size of particles and the number of detected particles, the contents of display desired to be used for a certain diagram may also be employed, in combination with the contents of display for other diagram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made on a function of displaying information on the positions of detected particles. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows information on the positions of all particles detected by a particle inspection. </paragraph>

The inspection apparatus has such a function so that the user can immediately find the positions on an object under inspection <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of particles having sizes in a particular range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows an exemplary result of a particle inspection displayed after the inspection. The display in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> comprises an inspection map <highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight> indicative of the positions at which particles are detected; a histogram <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight> for the sizes of the detected particles; a review button <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>; a review image <highlight><bold>2204</bold></highlight> of the detected particles; particles <highlight><bold>2205</bold></highlight>; a particle size data section <highlight><bold>2206</bold></highlight> to be reviewed. The review image <highlight><bold>2204</bold></highlight> is displayed centered at the particle <highlight><bold>2205</bold></highlight>. In this example, particles having sizes ranging from 2.8 &mgr;m to 3.0 &mgr;m in the data section <highlight><bold>2206</bold></highlight> are selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> In operation, after particles are inspected by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention, the inspection map <highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight> is displayed as information on the positions of the particles, and the histogram <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight> is displayed as information on particle sizes. Then, the data section <highlight><bold>2206</bold></highlight> is selected as a particle size to be reviewed.

<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</cross-reference> show another exemplary results of a particle inspection displayed after the inspection. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</cross-reference> respectively comprise an inspection map <highlight><bold>4301</bold></highlight> indicative of the positions at which particles are detected, a histogram <highlight><bold>4302</bold></highlight> for the sizes of the detected particles, and a scroll bar <highlight><bold>4303</bold></highlight> that specifies the size of a particle to be displayed. In this example, the scroll bar <highlight><bold>4303</bold></highlight> can adjust the size of particles ranging from 1.0 &mgr;m to 3.0 &mgr;m. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</cross-reference> shows the case where the button of the scroll bar <highlight><bold>4303</bold></highlight> is located at the leftmost position, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</cross-reference> shows the case where the button of the scroll bar <highlight><bold>4303</bold></highlight> is located at the position of 2.2 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> In operation, after particles are first inspected by the apparatus for inspecting particles and defects according to the present invention, the inspection map <highlight><bold>4301</bold></highlight> is displayed as information on the positions of particles, and the histogram is displayed as information on the sizes of the particles. The scroll bar <highlight><bold>4303</bold></highlight> is also displayed. This is the state indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</cross-reference>. Then, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>B, the size of a particle desired to be displayed is set to 2.2 &mgr;m or larger. For setting, the button of the scroll bar <highlight><bold>4303</bold></highlight> should be shifted from the position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</cross-reference> to the right by a mouse, to the position of 2.2 &mgr;m. At this point, display of particles on the inspection map <highlight><bold>4301</bold></highlight> is changed according to the shift of the button of the scroll bar <highlight><bold>4303</bold></highlight>. In the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>B, for example, since the scroll bar <highlight><bold>4301</bold></highlight> is at the position of 2.2 &mgr;m, the inspection map <highlight><bold>4301</bold></highlight> shows particles of 2.2 &mgr;m or larger alone. At the same time, in the histogram <highlight><bold>4302</bold></highlight> indicating the sizes of detected particles, the color of the particles of 2.2 &mgr;m or larger is made to be different from the color of particles of less than 2.2 &mgr;m. As described above, by changing particles to be displayed, a distribution of particles of respective sizes can be quickly seen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, though description was directed to the case where only the particles having sizes equal to or larger than a specified size are displayed on the inspection map <highlight><bold>4301</bold></highlight>, display of only the particles of less than the specified size may also be performed. If only discrimination between the particles of sizes equal to or larger than the specified size and other particles can be performed, particles of any size can be displayed. In order to perform discrimination, the color, form, and size of display should be changed, or a particle mark should be flashed, for example. If only the particles of the specified size are displayed, it is easy to find where the particles of the specified size are present. If other particles are also displayed together with the particles of the specified size, positional relationship of the particles of the specified size with respect to all the particles can be easily comprehended. In the histogram <highlight><bold>4302</bold></highlight> as well, if discrimination between the particles of the specified size and other particles can be performed, particles of any size can be used. Though this embodiment explains the case where the scroll bar <highlight><bold>4303</bold></highlight> was employed, if only the size of particles can be specified, any method can be employed. The screen into which numerical values are input for specification, for example, may also be employed. Though this embodiment explained an example of displaying particles of the specified size or larger, only the particles of the specified size may also be displayed, or the particles of the specified size or smaller may also be displayed as an alternative example of display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49 and 50</cross-reference> show examples of display indicating position information and information on the sizes of particles and/or defects when classification into the particles and the defects is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> comprises a graph <highlight><bold>4901</bold></highlight> where trace amounts obtained by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention are plotted, position information <highlight><bold>4902</bold></highlight> on detected particles and/or defects, a detected particle and/or defect count <highlight><bold>4903</bold></highlight>, and histograms <highlight><bold>4904</bold></highlight> showing the sizes of the detected particles and/or defects. This embodiment shows the case where scratches are detected as the defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the trace amounts employed for the graph <highlight><bold>4901</bold></highlight> are the amounts of scattered light caused by vertical-illumination and oblique-illumination, respectively, as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference>. Further, a line <highlight><bold>4905</bold></highlight> represents a discrimination threshold for discrimination between particles and scratches within the graph <highlight><bold>4901</bold></highlight>. The position information <highlight><bold>4902</bold></highlight> indicates the positions of particles or scratches on an object under inspection. This embodiment shows an example where particles are represented by &xcirc;, and scratches are represented by &utrif;. Further, the detection count <highlight><bold>4903</bold></highlight> indicates the number of detected particles and/or defects. The graphs <highlight><bold>4904</bold></highlight> are the histograms showing the numbers and the sizes of detected particles or scratches. Display of substances detected by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention in this way causes a distribution of particles and/or defects to be seen at a glance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</cross-reference> comprises position information <highlight><bold>5001</bold></highlight> on particles and/or defects detected by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention, a detected particle and/or defect quantity ratio <highlight><bold>5002</bold></highlight>, and a density graph <highlight><bold>5003</bold></highlight> for given sizes of particles and/or defects. In this embodiment, pattern defects are displayed as the defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the position information <highlight><bold>5001</bold></highlight> indicates the positions of the particles or pattern defects, and a closing line <highlight><bold>5004</bold></highlight> indicates a portion where particles or pattern defects are dense. Determination as to whether particles and/or defects are dense should be made according to whether a plurality of particles and/or defects is present in a given area. If a plurality of particles and/or defects is present in the given area, this area can be determined to the particle-and/or-defect dense area. The detected particle and/or defect quantity ratio <highlight><bold>5002</bold></highlight> indicates the ratio of the number of detected particles or pattern defects to the total number of detected particles and pattern defects, and an area in a circle graph corresponds to the ratio of the number of detected particles or pattern defects to the total number of detected particles and pattern defects. This graph allows the ratio of particles and/or defects detected by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention to be readily seen. The graph <highlight><bold>5003</bold></highlight> showing the density and size of particles and/or defects indicates the portion where the particles and/or defects are dense, or a distribution of the density and size of the particles and/or defects in the portion encircled by the closing line <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. This allows the density and size of particles and/or defects in a dense area to be readily seen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Next, a management approach applied when the statistics are collected in time series on particles having a particular size will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows a transition of the total sum of all particles, irrespective of the size, detected by the particle inspection apparatus, in time series for wafers processed in the same process by the same manufacturing apparatus. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference> shows a transition of the total sum of particles having sizes ranging from 2.8 to 3.0 &lsqb;&mgr;m&rsqb;, shown in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in time series. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> shows a transition of the total sum of the remaining particles in time series. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Thresholds <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> indicate management reference values for the number of particles in the three cases. When particles exceeding these thresholds are detected, this means that an associated wafer is diagnosed as defective. Specifically, it is determined from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> that a peak value <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> near an inspection time A is unusually high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> However, while a certain failure may be guessed from the statistics shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, its cause cannot be revealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when particles are managed by size in accordance with the inspection approach of the present invention, a remarkable peak <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> appears at A time in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>C, so that it is understood that particles having sizes ranging from 2.8 to 3.0 &lsqb;&mgr;m&rsqb; particularly concentrate in a lot which was inspected at that time. Thus, from the fact that no section exceeds the threshold in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B and the peak value <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> is sensed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>C, the user can guess by the reason shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C that patterns of these sizes peeled off and scattered on wafers during an etching process can be the cause for an unusual increase in the number of particles, and therefore immediately take effective countermeasures to the failure, such as checking the etching apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Next, an example of displaying a cause of failure to the user will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> The apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention has a function of analyzing the particle size and the number of detected particles to display a cause of failure to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> For example, assume that a graph as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> results from an inspection, taking the cause of failure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> as a model. Assume also that a section d-e in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> corresponds to the particle size range of 2.8 &mgr;m to 3.0 &mgr;m in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Therefore, when the result of inspection shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is obtained, the screen shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is displayed to clarify the user the result of analysis on the cause of failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Particle Management Approach&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Next described is another exemplary management approach based on the particle size. Particles detected by the inspection apparatus may be classified into those which cause a failure, and those which do not cause a failure. Specifically, if particles are smaller than wire widths and spaces between wires in a wiring pattern created on a wafer, such particles cause no failure in many cases. Therefore, detected particles having a certain size or more may be managed as a possible cause of failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made on an exemplary method of calculating a particle size to be managed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows the relationship between a wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2401</bold></highlight> having a wire width W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight> having a wire width W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a wiring pattern having a wire width W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on a wafer, and a particle <highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight>. When this particle <highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight> is conductive, the particle <highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight> attached, for example, at a position <highlight><bold>2405</bold></highlight> to connect the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2401</bold></highlight> and wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight> would cause the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2401</bold></highlight> and wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight> to short-circuit through the particle <highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight>, with the result that this chip becomes defective. As such, assuming that the distance between the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2401</bold></highlight> and wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight> is S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the distance between the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight> and wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2403</bold></highlight> is S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the particle <highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight> which can short-circuit the wiring pattern <highlight><bold>2402</bold></highlight> to another wire has a size of S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or more. Particularly, a particle having a size of (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&plus;S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) will short-circuit wires with possibility of 100%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the wiring patterns have the widths and distance between wires as defined above, the particle size causing a failure is given by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>MIN (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> where MIN (A, B) indicates the smaller value of A and B when they are compared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the example shown herein is a calculation for the most strict condition in management. If the condition is less strict, larger particles may be managed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> By determining a particle size to be managed in each manufacturing process by the calculation described above and monitoring fluctuations in the number of detected particles having the managed size or more, it is possible to sense the occurrence of a failure without delay. A monitoring method used herein may involve previously calculating an average and standard deviation of the number of particles under management detected, for example, from several to several tens of wafers, monitoring the number of particles based on a monitoring threshold calculated by: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Monitoring Threshold&equals;Average&plus;k&middot;Standard Deviation and analyzing a cause of failure and taking countermeasures to wafers on which the number of detected particles exceeds the monitoring threshold. In the above equation, k is a constant which may be set to k&equals;3, for example, when it is desired that the failure analysis is conducted for approximately 0.3% of all wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> Next described is another method of calculating a particle size to be managed. This method calculates the yield impact of particles exerted on the yield of wafers from the presence or absence of particles detected on one wafer, and determination made to chips (dies) on which the particles are detected as to whether they are non-defective or defective, and manages a particle size at which the calculated influence present a maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> A method of calculating the yield impact will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> shows chips (dies) on a wafer classified according to the presence or absence of particles, and non-defective and defective chips. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> shows chips <highlight><bold>3001</bold></highlight> (hereinafter labeled &ldquo;Gn&rdquo;) on which no particles have been detected and which are non-defective (good dies); chips <highlight><bold>3002</bold></highlight> (hereinafter labeled &ldquo;Bn&rdquo;) on which no particles have been detected but which are defective (bad dies); chips <highlight><bold>3003</bold></highlight> (hereinafter labeled &ldquo;Gp&rdquo;) on which particles have been detected but which are non-defective; and chips <highlight><bold>3004</bold></highlight> (hereinafter labeled &ldquo;Bp&rdquo;) on which particles have been detected and which are defective. Here, whether or not particles have been detected on a certain chip may be determined based on the position information in the result of an inspection performed by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. Also, determination as to whether a certain chip is non-defective or defective may be made using, for example, the result of an electric inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> First, assuming that the yield of a certain wafer is Y, and the yield of chips on which no particles have been detected is Yn, the yield impact dY of detected particles on the yield of the wafer is defined as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>dY&equals;Yn&minus;Y </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Since Y is the yield of the wafer, Y can be expressed by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Y&equals;Yn&middot;</italic></highlight>(1<highlight><italic>&minus;y</italic></highlight>)&plus;<highlight><italic>Yp&middot;&ggr;</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> where Yp is the yield of chips on which particles have been detected, and &ggr; is the proportion of chips on which particles have been detected with respect to the total number of chips (hereinafter called the &ldquo;particle occurrence frequency&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Here, using the aforementioned Gn, Bn, Gp, Bp: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Y&equals;</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>Gn&plus;Gp</italic></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>Gn&plus;Bn&plus;Gp&plus;Bp</italic></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> can be derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Therefore, dY can be expressed as follows:

<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Here, assuming that the probability of a chip determined as defective due to particles is represented by F (hereinafter called the &ldquo;critical probability&rdquo;), Yp can be expressed by: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> Here, the particle occurrence frequency &ggr; is larger as a particle detection sensitivity is higher, and smaller as the particle detection sensitivity is lower. This is because a higher detection sensitivity contributes to detection of a larger number of particles. The critical probability F in turn is smaller as the particle detection sensitivity is higher, and larger as the particle detection sensitivity is lower. This is because although a higher sensitivity contributes to detection of smaller particles, those particles which are smaller than the distance between wiring patterns do not cause a failure such as short-circuiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the yield impact dY on the yield is calculated, the particle sizes used in the calculation are limited. The particle size which maximizes the yield impact dY on the yield indicates the minimum particle size to be managed. The limitation on the particle sizes refers to using those data on particles having a certain size or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Details of the method of calculating the yield impact will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference>. In a graph <highlight><bold>5101</bold></highlight>, the yield impact dY on the yield is plotted on the vertical axis, while the particle size threshold is plotted on the horizontal axis. The particle size threshold herein refers to the threshold for all the particles of a certain size or larger. Specifically, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51, a</cross-reference> particle size threshold <highlight><bold>5102</bold></highlight> indicates the case where calculation is performed by using the data on particles having sizes equal to or more than &ldquo;A&rdquo; &mgr;m. The yield impact at that time is indicated by a point <highlight><bold>5103</bold></highlight>, and the result of particle detection at that time, or the result of detection of particles having sizes equal to or more than &ldquo;A&rdquo; &mgr;m is indicated by an inspection result <highlight><bold>5104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Likewise, a particle size threshold <highlight><bold>5105</bold></highlight> indicates the case where calculation is performed by using data on particles having sizes equal to or more than &ldquo;B&rdquo; &mgr;m. The yield impact at that time is indicated by a point <highlight><bold>5106</bold></highlight>, and the result of particle detection at that time is indicated by an inspection result <highlight><bold>5107</bold></highlight>. Further, a particle size threshold <highlight><bold>5108</bold></highlight> indicates the case where calculation is performed by using data on particles having sizes equal to or more than &ldquo;C&rdquo; &mgr;n. The yield impact is indicated by a point <highlight><bold>5109</bold></highlight>, and the result of particle detection at that time is indicated by an inspection result <highlight><bold>5110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> A graph <highlight><bold>5111</bold></highlight> is obtained by calculating the yield impact by means of respective particle size thresholds. Since calculation is performed according to the above-mentioned approach, the graph <highlight><bold>5111</bold></highlight> represents the influences of the respective particle sizes on the yield. Accordingly, the particle size threshold with a high yield impact represents the particle size whereby particles that affects the yield can be efficiently performed. In this sense, it is the particle size to be managed on the semiconductor device manufacturing line. Specifically, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference>, since a plot point <highlight><bold>5112</bold></highlight> on the graph <highlight><bold>5111</bold></highlight> indicates the maximum value of calculation, the above-mentioned minimum particle size to be managed becomes a particle size threshold <highlight><bold>5113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows an exemplary result of calculating the yield impact dY on the yield. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows the yield impact dY on the yield on the vertical axis, and the particle size used in calculating the yield impact dY on the yield on the horizontal axis. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24, a</cross-reference> point <highlight><bold>2501</bold></highlight> indicates that the yield impact dY on the yield is 0.1 as a result of the calculation using data on particles having sizes equal to or more than 0.1 &mgr;m, and a point <highlight><bold>2502</bold></highlight> indicates that the yield impact dY on the yield is 0.8 as a result of the calculation using data on particles having sizes equal to or more than 0.4 &mgr;m. Here, using data on particles having the sizes equal to or more than 0.1 &mgr;m means that the calculation is performed on the assumption that among detected particles, chips on which particles of 0.1 &mgr;m or more have been detected are regarded as chips on which particles are attached, and chips on which particles less than 0.1 &mgr;m have been detected or no particles have been detected are regarded as chips on which no particles are attached. Thus, it is appreciated from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> that the yield impact dY on the yield is the largest when it is calculated using data on particles of 0.4 &mgr;m or more, so that particles of 0.4 &mgr;m or more should be managed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference> shows an example of the yield impact dY on the yield for each step. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference> shows a graph <highlight><bold>5201</bold></highlight> obtained as a result of calculation using data in step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a graph <highlight><bold>5202</bold></highlight> obtained as a result of calculation using data in step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a management particle size display <highlight><bold>5203</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>, step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shows the case where particles having sizes equal to or more than 0.3 &mgr;m should be managed, while step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shows the case where particles having sizes equal to or more than 0.7 &mgr;m should be managed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing embodiment shows that the particle size is changed in increments of 0.1 &mgr;m, the increment may be 0.2 &mgr;m or any other value. Also, while the foregoing embodiment has been described for an example which determines the particle size that exerts the largest yield impact dY on the yield as the method of determining a particle size to be managed, the particle size to be managed need not be the particle size that exerts the largest influence, but may be a particle size that presents a value close to the largest yield impact dY on the yield, for example, a value equal to or more than the largest yield impact dY multiplied by 0.9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C show another exemplary result of calculation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C show the result of calculating the yield impact dY on the yield; and particle detection maps at that time. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33A</cross-reference> shows, by way of example, that the yield impact dY on the yield is calculated in increments of approximately 0.07 &mgr;m of particle size, and values on the vertical axis are represented in percent. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33B</cross-reference> is a particle detection map which displays all particles detected by the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33C</cross-reference> is a particle detection map which shows extracted particles having the sizes equal to or more than 1.1 &mgr;m. The value of 1.1 &mgr;m indicates the particle size that exerts the largest yield impact dY on the yield in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33A</cross-reference>. It is therefore understood that particles may be managed based on the particle detection map of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, though description was directed to the use of data on a single wafer, the yield impact dY on the yield may also be calculated separately using data on a plurality of wafers. Then, the average value of the yield impact dY may be defined as the typical value of the yield impact dY on the yield. This method is advantageous in that erroneous evaluation due to the data on a special wafer can be reduced. Alternatively, the sizes of particles to be managed may be calculated using data on a plurality of wafers, and the minimum particle size value for a certain step may be defined as the particle size to be managed for the stverticaln this case, the management that is more strict than the one using the data on a single wafer becomes possible, which can lead to improvement in the quality of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Further, if the number of chips on a wafer is small, the accuracy of calculating the yield impact dY on the yield is sometimes reduced. Thus, when calculating the yield impact dY on the yield, data on a plurality of wafers may also be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made on an approach for managing a semiconductor device manufacturing process when the yield impact dY on the yield is used for the management. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> shows a graph which sets the aforementioned yield impact dY on the yield on the vertical axis, and a semiconductor manufacturing process on the horizontal axis. Specifically, the horizontal axis shows steps in the process in which particles are inspected using the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation will be described. First, an inspection is conducted in each of the steps in the process shown on the horizontal axis using the same wafer. Next, at the time each of chips on the wafer is determined as non-defective or defective, the aforementioned yield impact dY on the yield is calculated for each step. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is an example of calculating the yield impact dY on the yield in each step. For example, a point <highlight><bold>2601</bold></highlight> indicates that the yield impact dY on the yield is 0.8 when calculated using particles detected in a step labeled &ldquo;Step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&rdquo; in the process. In this way, the yield impact dY on the yield is calculated in each step, and countermeasures are taken preferentially from a step which presents a larger yield impact dY on the yield, thereby making it possible to take countermeasures from a step which is more likely to cause a failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing embodiment, all data on particles detected in each step are used for calculating the yield impact dY. For particles which have been known that they had occurred in a different step, the yield impact dY on the yield may be calculated using the remaining data except for the data on the particles. For removing data, for example, information on the position of particles detected in Step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> may be compared with information on the position of particles detected in Step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the particles previously detected in Step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be deleted from data on particles in Step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Also, the foregoing embodiment has been described for the management of particle size using the yield impact dY on the yield expressed by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>dY&equals;Yn&middot;F&middot;&ggr;</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> When a failure caused by a process is eliminated by improving the process management, </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>dY&equals;F&middot;&ggr;</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> may be used by setting the aforementioned Yn to one (Yn&equals;1). The approach of the present invention may also be applied to any index for calculating the influence of particles. For example, for memory products such as DRAM, the number of defective bits caused by each particle may be used as an index. Further, in the case of a chip on which particles have been detected, a proportion of non-defective chips on which particles have been detected, or the above-mentioned Yp may also be used as the index. Alternatively, the number of chips on which particles have been detected, or the above-mentioned &ggr; may also be used as the index, or the critical probability F may also be used as the index. When using the indexes of Yp and F, the influence of particles can be directly calculated, and when using the index of &ggr;, the influence of particles can be calculated immediately after inspection. Alternatively, the value of (Y&minus;Yp) may also be used as the index, and the value of (Yn&minus;Yp) may also be used as the index. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference> shows an example of displaying calculated dY, F, and &ggr;. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53, a</cross-reference> graph <highlight><bold>5301</bold></highlight> is obtained by calculating the dY on the yield, while the graph <highlight><bold>5302</bold></highlight> represents the critical probability F. Further, the graph <highlight><bold>5303</bold></highlight> is obtained by calculating the proportion &ggr; of chips on which particles have been detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, data on particles having sizes equal to or more than a certain size is employed as the data for calculating the yield impact dY on the yield. For the calculation, the data on particles of a given size may also be employed. In this case, since the influence on the particles of the given size can be evaluated, accurate evaluation becomes possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the yield impact dY on the yield may also be calculated according to the shape of a particle described before. This method is advantageous in that efficient countermeasures can be taken. That is, the shape of a particle is often associated with the cause of occurrence. Thus, it is important to define the shape of a particle against which countermeasures should be taken. By preferentially taking countermeasures against a particle having the shape that greatly affects the yield impact dY on the yield according to the approach of the present invention, countermeasures against defective semiconductor devices can be efficiently performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> The foregoing embodiment is advantageous in that since wiring pattern widths and space widths in a semiconductor device are only required as information for determining whether a particle causes a failure in the example described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23, a</cross-reference> particle size to be managed can be determined at the time the design of a semiconductor device is definite. The example described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, in turn, is advantageous in that it employs an index including a consideration of information such as short-circuiting of wires due to the height of a particle, and so on, as well as the width of the particle, so that the actual state of device can be known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> Next, an example of display using the above-mentioned yield impact dY on the yield will be shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>, the particle size threshold is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the yield impact is plotted on the vertical axis. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference> includes a graph <highlight><bold>5401</bold></highlight>, a detection result <highlight><bold>5402</bold></highlight>, and a detected particle count <highlight><bold>5403</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>, the graph <highlight><bold>5401</bold></highlight> is obtained by connecting the values of the yield impacts for the respective particle thresholds. The detection result <highlight><bold>5402</bold></highlight> and the detected particle count <highlight><bold>5403</bold></highlight> indicate the results of particle detection and the number of detected particles for a particle size threshold <highlight><bold>5404</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, in this embodiment, only a combination of the result of detection and the number of detected particles for the given particle size threshold is displayed. However, other combination of the result of inspection and the number of detected particles for other particle size threshold may be additionally provided for display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description was directed to the approach for determining from a detected particle a size to be managed. This approach can be applied irrespective of whether other detected substances except particles and/or defects are present or not. In other words, this approach is effective in an inspection performed on in both of the cases where the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects erroneously detects normal patterns and where the apparatus does not erroneously detect normal patterns. Accordingly, strict settings of inspection conditions does not need to be performed for the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects, so that settings of inspection conditions becomes simplified or unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Inspection on Particles by Region and Analysis on Cause of Failure&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made on an embodiment which manages particle data by region on a wafer to take countermeasures using the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> schematically illustrates regions on a semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A, 12B</cross-reference> are schematic diagrams each clearly showing particles of a particular size on a wafer when particle data is managed separately for each region; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13, 14</cross-reference> are graphs each showing the number of detected particles by size in each region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Generally, when a chip pattern is formed on a semiconductor wafer, the pattern is not always formed uniformly, but some region in the pattern exhibits a higher pattern forming density while another region in the pattern exhibits a lower pattern forming density. For example, assuming that a chip illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a microprocessor, the pattern is divided, for example, into a region <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> for memory cell circuits; a region <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> for data input/output circuits; and a region <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> in which no circuit pattern exists. Generally, these regions <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> differ in circuit pattern integration degree from one another. As a result, different sizes of particles would cause failures in the respective regions. In other words, the particle size which should be managed and analyzed differs from one region to another in a chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Specifically stated, for example, when a particle of size a or more would cause the chip to be defective in the region <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>; a particle of size &bgr; or more in the region <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>; and a particle of size &ggr; or more in the region <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, information on these regions and information on particle size which causes the chip to be defective in each of these regions are previously stored in the inspection apparatus as management data. The information on the regions and information on particle size causing the defective chip may be directly entered on a screen which may be provided on the inspection apparatus for entering coordinate values and particle size, or regions may be selected from an optical image captured by a TV camera or the like. Alternatively, data may be downloaded from a higher rank system, or data may be read into the inspection apparatus from a removable storage medium, for example, a floppy disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> By providing the inspection apparatus with the information on the regions and the information on particle sizes which cause the chip to be defective, an object under inspection is inspected. Then, a region is determined from information on the position of a detected particle in the inspection apparatus, and the information on the detected particle size is compared with the information on particle sizes which cause the chip to be defective, to determine whether or not the detected particle will cause a failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> As a result, particles determined as a cause of failure and particles not determined as a cause of failure are displayed in different forms, such that the particles determined as a cause of failure are distinctively displayed to the user, thereby allowing the user to be immediately aware of the particles which cause a failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> The foregoing approach will be shown in a specific manner with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A, 12B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> A wafer shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A, 12B</cross-reference> is displayed with the positions of detected particles <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> indicated thereon. Since the result of detection has been displayed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> in the prior art, an analysis on the cause of failure involves selecting proper particles and analyzing the selected particles. Therefore, the prior art suffers from a low probability that particles which should be essentially analyzed can be selected, and a long time required for the analysis on the cause of failure. On the contrary, by displaying in a different form those particles which have been determined as the cause of failure using the foregoing determination, i.e., particles <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight> which should be analyzed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, it is possible to readily select the particles <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight> which should be analyzed from detected particles, to increase the probability that the particles which should be analyzed can be selected, and to rapidly analyze the cause of failure. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, for displaying different regions in different manners, they are displayed in different patterns. Alternatively, these region may be displayed in different colors or sizes. Further alternatively, displayed particles may be limited to those which cause a failure. Also, while the foregoing embodiment divides a chip into several regions, the wafer surface may be divided, for example, in accordance with the distance from the center of the wafer to the wafer edge, and different particle sizes may be managed in different regions. Furthermore, the layout of semiconductor chips may be displayed on the wafer shape <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Next, description will be made on an approach for inspecting the number of particles detected in respective regions to take countermeasures to a failure with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> In this example, a wafer is divided into three regions, designated Region A, Region B, Region C, in each of which the number of particles is detected. Then, the result is displayed to the user in the form of graph for each region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the horizontal axis represents the particle size, and the vertical axis represents the number of detected particles, wherein different colors are allocated to Region A, Region B, Region C, respectively, the particles are displayed by size in graphical representation, and the numbers of particles falling under the same size category in the three regions are displayed side by side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the numbers of particles falling under the same size category may be displayed in stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the three regions may be a memory cell region, a circuit region other than memory circuit, and region without circuit pattern, for example, on a semiconductor wafer. By displaying these regions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, the management of particles by region is facilitated. The information on the regions may be directly entered on a screen which may be provided on the inspection apparatus for entering coordinate values and particle size, or regions may be selected from an optical image captured by a TV camera or the like. Alternatively, data may be downloaded from a higher rank system, or data may be read into the inspection apparatus from a removable storage medium, for example, a floppy disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> Next described will be an approach for counting the number of detected particles by size in each of regions to find out defective products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> As described above, the particle size determined as a cause of failure differs from one region to another. In a certain region which does not include very fine circuits, even a relatively large particle would not be regarded as a cause of failure. On the other hand, in another region which includes fine circuits, even a relatively small particle could cause a trouble. In this way, thresholds over which an alarm is generated are designated by &agr;, &bgr;, &ggr; for Region A, Region B, Region C, respectively. For example, in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13, 14</cross-reference>, assume: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> &agr;&equals;1.0 &lsqb;&mgr;m&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> &bgr;&equals;1.6 &lsqb;&mgr;m&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> &ggr;&equals;2.0 &lsqb;&mgr;m&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> With these thresholds, the total sum of detected particles exceeding the threshold set for each region is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> Region A . . . 24 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> Region B . . . 3 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Region C . . . 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Even though a very large number of particles are apparently detected in Region C, they do not significantly affect the quality of a product. On the other hand, particles detected in Region A, the number of which is not so large as in Region C, is highly likely to affect the quality of the product, so that the product could be determined as defective due to the particles attached on Region A with a high probability. In this way, a reasonable inspection can be conducted in accordance with the characteristic of each region by setting a threshold of particle size for each region, over which a particle detected therein is regarded as a cause of failure, counting the total sum of detected particles exceeding the threshold in each region, determining whether the object under testing is non-defective or defective, and displaying the user to the result of determination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Device Performance Evaluation Approach Using Particle Size&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> Next, an approach to evaluating an inspection apparatus according to the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55A and 55B</cross-reference> are graphs in which the yield impact is calculated for each device or for each detection sensitivity. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55A and 55B</cross-reference>, the above-mentioned yield impact is plotted on the vertical axis, and the particle size threshold is plotted on the horizontal axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> Next, the evaluation approach will be described. First, the same objects under inspection are inspected by inspection apparatuses to be evaluated, and then the graphs of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55A and 55B</cross-reference> each indicating the yield impact for each particle size threshold are created. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55A and 55B</cross-reference> are examples of the graphs thus created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55A</cross-reference> shows a graph <highlight><bold>5501</bold></highlight> as a result of calculation by an inspection apparatus A and a graph <highlight><bold>5502</bold></highlight> as a result of calculation by an inspection apparatus B. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>A, the minimum particle size thresholds for both of the inspection apparatuses are approximately 0.6 &mgr;m. However, the yield impact calculated by the inspection apparatus A is larger than that calculated by the inspection apparatus B. This is because the inspection apparatus A detects more particles that affect the yield. In other words, the inspection apparatus B would have a lower particle capturing ratio than the inspection apparatus A. Accordingly, the inspection apparatus A is more suited to the object under inspection employed in this embodiment than the inspection apparatus b. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55B</cross-reference> comprises a graph <highlight><bold>5501</bold></highlight> as a result of calculation by the inspection apparatus A and a graph <highlight><bold>5503</bold></highlight> as a result of calculation by an inspection apparatus C. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>B, for the particle size thresholds smaller than 1.3 &mgr;m, the yield impact is of approximately the same level in both of the apparatuses. However, in regard to the inspection apparatus C, there is no data for the particle size threshold smaller than 1.3 &mgr;m. This is because the inspection apparatus C does not detect particles of sizes smaller than 1.3 &mgr;m. In other words, the inspection apparatus C does not have sufficient detection sensitivity. Accordingly, for the object under inspection employed in this embodiment, the inspection apparatus A is more suitable for inspection than the inspection apparatus C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> With the approach as described above, evaluation of the performance of an inspection apparatus becomes possible. Further, by performing the evaluation for each of the processes, the optimal inspection apparatus for each of the processes can be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, description was directed to the evaluation approach where graphs have been created. However, it is not always necessary to create graphs. The maximum value of the yield impact may be determined, and then evaluation may be performed using the maximum value. In this embodiment, though the yield impact is used as an evaluation index, other indexes used when the approach for determining the management particle size was described may also be used for evaluation. Further, if an inspection apparatus to be evaluated does not have a function of outputting data on the size of a particle and/or a defect, the result of inspection by the apparatus may be reviewed by the review apparatus, and then the size of the particle and/or defect may also be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference> shows examples of evaluations of three inspection apparatuses. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference> shows graphs in which the yield impact were calculated by the three inspection apparatuses, and graphs <highlight><bold>5601</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5602</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>5603</bold></highlight> are the results of calculation by the respective three inspection apparatuses. By displaying the results of calculation by a plurality of inspection apparatuses as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference>, the performance of the inspection apparatuses can be readily seen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;About Display&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> About display according to the present invention described above, display may be performed on the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects according to the present invention. Alternatively, display may also be performed on a terminal connected to a host system. In this case, display on the terminal of the host system is advantageous in that the result of inspection can be seen on any terminal connected to the host system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;About Optical System in Apparatus for Inspecting Particles and/or Defects&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing description on the present invention, the optical system in the apparatus for inspecting particles and/or defects employs scattered light to detect particles and measure the sizes of the particles. The approach of the present invention, however, can be applied to an optical system which relies on reflected light to detect particles and/or defects and measure the sizes thereof. Generally, the optical system relying on scattered light exhibits a high inspection efficiency but a low measurement accuracy. On the contrary, the optical system relying on reflected light exhibits a low inspection efficiency, but a high measurement accuracy. The approach of the present invention can be applied to either of the optical systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> As appreciated from the foregoing, the present invention provides an apparatus and method for inspecting particles ore defects, which are suitable for use in inspecting particles and/or defects in processes for manufacturing semiconductor wafers or thin film substrates and conducting a failure analysis based on the inspection result. The inspection apparatus and method are capable of rapidly taking countermeasures to a failure by conducting an inspection and a failure analysis in accordance with the characteristics of particles and patterns or the characteristics of regions on an object under inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The present invention is therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be the embraced therein. </paragraph>
