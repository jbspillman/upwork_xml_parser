<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to stereolithography and, more specifically, to the use of stereolithography in forming multilayer structures with vertical or near-vertical sides, such structures including packages for semiconductor devices and the like. Most particularly, the present invention relates to forming multilayer structures with sides of enhanced smoothness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the past decade, a manufacturing technique termed &ldquo;stereolithography&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;layered manufacturing&rdquo;, has evolved to a degree where it is employed in many industries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Essentially, stereolithography as conventionally practiced, involves utilizing a computer to generate a three-dimensional (3-D) mathematical simulation or model of an object to be fabricated, such generation usually being effected with 3-D computer-aided design (CAD) software. The model or simulation is mathematically separated or &ldquo;sliced&rdquo; into a large number of relatively thin, parallel, usually vertically superimposed layers, each layer having defined boundaries and other features associated with the model (and thus the actual object to be fabricated) at the level of that layer within the exterior boundaries of the object. A complete assembly or stack of all of the layers defines the entire object, and surface resolution of the object is, in part, dependent upon the thickness of the layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The mathematical simulation or model is then employed to generate an actual object by building the object, layer by superimposed layer. A wide variety of approaches to stereolithography by different companies has resulted in techniques for fabrication of objects from both metallic and nonmetallic materials. Regardless of the material employed to fabricate an object, stereolithographic techniques usually involve disposition of a layer of unconsolidated or unfixed material corresponding to each layer within the object boundaries, followed by selective consolidation or fixation of the material to at least a semisolid state in those areas of a given layer corresponding to portions of the object, the consolidate or fixed material also at that time being substantially concurrently bonded to a lower layer. The unconsolidated material employed to build an object may be supplied in particulate or liquid form, and the material itself may be consolidated or fixed or a separate binder material may be employed to bond material particles to one another and to those of a previously formed layer. In some instances, thin sheets of material may be superimposed to build an object, each sheet being fixed to a next lower sheet and unwanted portions of each sheet removed, a stack of such sheets defining the completed object. When particulate materials are employed, resolution of object surfaces is highly dependent upon particle size, whereas when a liquid is employed, surface resolution is highly dependent upon the minimum surface area of the liquid which can be fixed and the minimum thickness of a layer which can be generated. Of course, in either case, resolution and accuracy of object reproduction from the CAD file is also dependent upon the ability of the apparatus used to fix the material to precisely track the mathematical instructions indicating solid areas and boundaries for each layer of material. Toward that end, and depending upon the layer being fixed, various fixation approaches have been employed, including particle bombardment (electron beams), disposing a binder or other fixative (such as by inkjet printing techniques), or irradiation using heat or specific wavelength ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An early application of stereolithography was to enable rapid fabrication of molds and prototypes of objects from CAD files. Thus, either male or female forms on which mold material might be disposed might be rapidly generated. Prototypes of objects might be built to verify the accuracy of the CAD file defining the object and to detect any design deficiencies and possible fabrication problems before a design was committed to large-scale production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In more recent years, stereolithography has been employed to develop and refine object designs in relatively inexpensive materials and has also been used to fabricate small quantities of objects where the cost of conventional fabrication techniques is prohibitive, such as in the case of plastic objects conventionally formed by injection molding. It is also known to employ stereolithography in the custom fabrication of products generally built in small quantities or where a product design is rendered only once. Finally, it has been appreciated in some industries that stereolithography provides a capability to fabricate products, such as those including closed interior chambers or convoluted passageways, which cannot be fabricated satisfactorily using conventional manufacturing techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To the inventors&apos; knowledge, stereolithography has yet to be applied to mass production of articles in volumes of thousands or millions, or employed to produce, augment or enhance products including other, pre-existing components in large quantities, where minute component sizes are involved, and where extremely high resolution and a high degree of reproducibility of results is required. Furthermore, conventional stereolithography apparatus and methods fail to address the difficulties of precisely locating and orienting a number of preexisting components for stereolithographic application of material thereto without the use of mechanical alignment techniques or to otherwise assuring precise, repeatable placement of components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the electronics industry, state-of-the-art packaging of semiconductor dice is an extremely capital-intensive proposition. In many cases, discrete semiconductor dice carried on, and electrically connected to, leadframes are individually packaged with a filled polymer material in a transfer molding process. A transfer molding apparatus is extremely expensive, costing at least hundreds of thousands of dollars in addition to the multi-hundred thousand dollar cost of the actual transfer molding dies in which strips of leadframes bearing semiconductor dice are disposed for encapsulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Encapsulative packaging of a semiconductor device already mounted on a substrate by molding and other presently used methods may be very difficult, time-consuming and costly. In some cases, the device may be packaged using a so-called &ldquo;glob-top&rdquo; material such as a silicone gel, but the package boundaries are imprecisely defined, a dam structure may be required to contain the slumping gel material, and the seal achieved is generally nonhermetic. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes a method of forming a precisely dimensioned structure from a photopolymer material by a stereolithographic process. The structure is formed by creating one or more layers of at least partially polymerized material adjacent a preformed electronic component or other small component with a high degree of precision to create a wall adjacent thereto or, optionally, an encapsulative package therefor. For example, a semiconductor die may be provided with a protective structure in the form of a layer of dielectric material having a controlled thickness or depth over or adjacent one or more surfaces thereof. As used herein, the term &ldquo;package&rdquo; as employed with reference to electrical components includes partial, as well as full, covering or encapsulation of a given semiconductor die surface with a dielectric material, and specifically includes fabrication of a semiconductor die configured in a so-called &ldquo;chip-scale&rdquo; package, wherein the package itself, including the die, is of substantially the same dimensions as, or only slightly larger than, the die itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The packaging method of the present invention may be applied, by way of example and not limitation, to a die mounted to a leadframe (having a die mounting paddle or in a paddle-less leads-over-chip (LOC), or in a leads-under-chip (LUC) configuration), mounted to a carrier substrate in a chip-on-board (COB) or board-on-chip (BOC) arrangement, a semiconductor die in a so-called &ldquo;flip-chip&rdquo; configuration, or in other packaging designs, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention employs computer-controlled, 3-D CAD initiated, stereolithographic techniques to apply protective and alignment structures to an electronic component such as a semiconductor die. A dielectric layer or layer segments may be formed over or adjacent a single die or substantially simultaneously over or adjacent a large number of dice or die locations on a semiconductor wafer or other large-scale semiconductor substrate, individual dice or groups of dice then being singulated therefrom. The package may be formed to cover the lateral surfaces as well as the upper and/or lower surfaces of a semiconductor die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Precise mechanical alignment of singulated semiconductor dice or larger semiconductor substrates having multiple die locations is not required to practice the method of the present invention, which includes the use of machine vision to locate dice and features or other components thereon or associated therewith (such as leadframes, bond wires, solder bumps, etc.) or features on a larger substrate for alignment and material disposition purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, packaging for electronic components according to the invention is fabricated using precisely focused coherent electromagnetic radiation in the form of an ultraviolet (UV) wavelength laser under control of a computer and responsive to input from a machine vision system such as a pattern recognition system to fix or cure a liquid material in the form of a photopolymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A multilayer package structure is formed by placing an object in a bath of photopolymer material to a depth forming a thin liquid layer which will comprise the lowermost layer of the package structure. A laser beam of coherent radiation is controllably passed over selected portions of the thin layer of photopolymer material for partial polymerization thereof. The object is then lowered to a depth to form a second thin liquid layer of photopolymer material over the at least partially polymerized prior layer, followed by laser exposure. A stack of at least partially polymerized layers is thus formed, comprising as many consecutive, at least partially superimposed layers as are required to achieve the desired structure height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the structure fabrication process, small interstitial horizontal crevices are defined at the joints between adjacent layers of the structure. Unpolymerized liquid photopolymer material forms a meniscus in each of the crevices. As such uncured material is typically rinsed from the structure after it is removed from the bath, a subsequent complete cure of the photopolymer of the structure outside of the bath does not fill the crevices, but leaves such crevices as unsightly, rough surface features which reduce the effective wall thickness of the structure and may also undesirably collect dust, dirt and moisture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes methods and apparatus for substantially eliminating these interlayer crevices and smoothing the joints between the structure layers. Following the exemplary formation of a desired multilayer package structure about an object such as a semiconductor die, the die with surrounding package structure is removed from the photopolymer bath and excess liquid photopolymer drained therefrom. The object is then tilted by about 5-90 degrees from the horizontal so as to reorient the side walls thereof to face at least partially upwardly, and the crevices between horizontal at least partially cured photopolymer layers, each containing a meniscus of unpolymerized liquid photopolymer, are subjected to radiation of an appropriate wavelength to polymerize the liquid meniscus material and smooth the exterior surfaces of the package structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is also contemplated that the present invention has utility with respect to the formation of stand-alone structures and not merely structures fabricated in association with preexisting objects, such as the aforementioned semiconductor dice or other electronic components.</paragraph>

Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate that apparatus of other designs and manufacture may be modified to practice the method of the present invention. The preferred basic stereolithography apparatus which may be modified in accordance with the present invention, as well as conventional operation of such apparatus, are described in great detail in United States Patents assigned to 3D Systems, Inc. of Valencia, Calif., such patents including, without limitation, U.S. Pat.

The disclosure of each of the foregoing patents is hereby incorporated herein by this reference. The stereolithographic apparatus may be modified as described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/259,142 filed Feb. 26, 1999, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and hereby incorporated herein by this reference. This earlier application relates to the use of a &ldquo;machine vision&rdquo; system with suitable programming of the computer controlling the stereolithographic process, eliminating the need for accurate positioning or mechanical alignment of workpieces to which material is stereolithographically applied, and expands the use to large numbers of workpieces which may have differing orientation, size, thickness and surface topography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> While the workpieces employed in the practice of the preferred embodiment of the method of the invention are, by way of example only, semiconductor dice, wafers, partial wafers, other substrates of semiconductor material or carrier substrates bearing integrated circuits on dice or other semiconductor structures, the method and apparatus of the invention are applicable to fabricating other products including workpieces having the aforementioned variations in orientation, size, thickness and surface topography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With reference again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 1A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B, a 3-D CAD drawing of a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be fabricated in the form of a data file is placed in the memory of a computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> controlling the operation of apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, if computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not a CAD computer in which the original object design is effected. In other words, an object design may be effected in a first computer in an engineering or research facility and the data files transferred via wide or local area network, tape, disc, CD-ROM or otherwise as known in the art to computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for object fabrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The data is preferably formatted in an STL (for StereoLithography) file, STL being a standardized format employed by a majority of manufacturers of stereolithography equipment. Fortunately, the format has been adopted for use in many solid-modeling CAD programs, so often translation from another internal geometric database format is unnecessary. In an STL file, the boundary surfaces of a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are defined as a mesh of interconnected triangles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (which may comprise a removable reservoir interchangeable with other reservoirs containing different materials) of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be employed in fabricating the intended structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In the currently preferred embodiment, the liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a photo-curable polymer (hereinafter &ldquo;photopolymer&rdquo;) responsive to light in the UV wavelength range. The surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is automatically maintained at an extremely precise, constant magnitude by devices known in the art responsive to output of sensors within apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and preferably under control of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,931, referenced above and previously incorporated herein by reference, discloses one suitable level control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A support platform or elevator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown, having an upper surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and moved by platform actuator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is precisely vertically movable by actuator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via platform controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in fine, repeatable increments responsive to control of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and is located for movement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> downward into and upward out of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In addition, under the actuation of actuator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is controllably tiltable by movement <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to an acute angle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> with the horizontal plane (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment, platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotatable by movement <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> about a vertical axis <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and/or structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> placed on the platform comprise a base upon which structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are formed by a stereolithographic process in this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for generating a beam of light <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the UV wavelength range has associated therewith appropriate optics and galvanometers. The laser beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is reflected by reflective apparatus <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to shape and define beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is directed downwardly to the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and traversed in the X-Y plane, that is to say, in a horizontal plane, in a selected pattern under control of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Liquid photopolymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is exposed to laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as it is scanned in an X-Y plane is at least partially cured thereby to at least a semisolid state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Data from the STL files resident in the memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is manipulated to build a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> one layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at a time. The structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is constructed on a base which may comprise the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a pre-existing object <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or other object. Accordingly, the data mathematically representing structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is divided into subsets, each subset representing a slice or layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This is effected by mathematically sectioning the 3-D CAD model into a plurality of horizontal layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a &ldquo;stack&rdquo; of such layers representing object <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Each slice or layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be from about 0.0001 inch to about 0.0300 inch thick. The preferred range of layer thickness is from about 0.002 inch to about 0.020 inch. A slice or layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with a relatively small layer thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> promotes higher resolution by enabling better reproduction of fine vertical surface features of structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed of layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having greater thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will have fewer layers; thus, it is constructed with fewer scans of the laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the overall production rate is typically higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In some instances, a base support or supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or pre-existing object <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may also be programmed as a separate STL file. The use of such base supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, which are enlarged views of a portion of the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on which a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is to be fabricated. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is to be constructed on prior-formed base supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The exemplary structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is depicted as formed of 4 layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>D, each formed by a scan of a laser. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> structure in the form of a protective polymeric package <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is to be formed by STL over a pre-existing object <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, e.g., a semiconductor die. Base supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are first fabricated on surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to support and attach the die to the platform. Then, the overlying structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed by a plurality of laser scans, each at a higher elevation. Such supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> facilitate fabrication of a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with reference to a perfectly horizontal plane above the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be constructed upon or adjacent to a pre-existing object <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> such as a semiconductor die, electronic substrate, or the like. The formation of a base support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> between the pre-existing object <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the platform surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> enables rigid and precise positioning of the pre-existing object <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in a desired precise orientation on the platform surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Where a &ldquo;recoater&rdquo; blade <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is employed as described below, the interposition of base supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> precludes inadvertent contact of blade <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with platform surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Before fabrication of structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is initiated with apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the primary STL file for structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the file for base support(s) <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (if used) are merged. It should be recognized that, while reference has been made to a single structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, multiple structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be concurrently fabricated on surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In such an instance, the STL files for the various structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and supports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, if any, are merged. Operational parameters for apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are then set, for example, to adjust the size (diameter, if circular) of the laser light beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> used to cure material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Before initiation of a first support layer for a support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, or a first layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A for a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is commenced, computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> automatically checks and, if necessary, adjusts by means known in the art as referenced above, the surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to maintain same at an appropriate focal length for laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,931, referenced above and previously incorporated by reference, discloses one suitable level control system. Alternatively, the height of reflective apparatus <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be adjusted responsive to a detected surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to cause the focal point of laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to be located precisely at the surface of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> if level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is permitted to vary, although this approach is somewhat more complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may then be submerged in liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a depth equal to the thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of one layer or slice <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the liquid surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> readjusted as required to accommodate liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> displaced by submergence of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then activated so that laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will scan liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to at least partially cure (e.g., at least partially polymerize) liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at selected locations, defining the boundaries of a first layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (of structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or support <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as the case may be) and filling in solid portions thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then lowered by a distance equal to the thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of a layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and the laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> scanned to define and fill in the second layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B while simultaneously bonding the second layer to the first. The process is then repeated, layer by layer, until structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> If a recoater blade <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is employed, the process sequence is somewhat different. In this instance, the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is lowered into liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> below surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, then raised thereabove until it is precisely one layer&apos;s thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> below blade <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Blade <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> then sweeps horizontally over surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, or (to save time) at least over a portion thereof on which a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is to be fabricated, to remove excess liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and leave a film thereof of the precise, desired thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then lowered so that the surface of the film and material level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are coplanar and the surface of the material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is still. Laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then initiated to scan with laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and define the first layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A. The process is repeated, layer by layer, to define each succeeding layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and simultaneously bond same to the next lower layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> until structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is completed. A more detailed discussion of this sequence and apparatus for performing same is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,931, previously incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to the above approach to preparing a layer of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for scanning with laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a layer of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be formed on surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by lowering platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to flood material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or over the highest completed layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, then raising platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and horizontally traversing a so-called &ldquo;meniscus&rdquo; blade across the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (or just the formed portion of structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) one layer thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> thereabove, followed by initiation of laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and scanning of beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to define the next higher layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Yet another alternative to layer preparation of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is to merely lower platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a depth equal to that of a layer of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be scanned, and then traverse a combination flood bar and meniscus bar assembly (not shown) horizontally over platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (or merely over structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) to substantially concurrently flood liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and define a precise layer thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> All of the foregoing methods and apparatus for liquid material flooding and layer thickness control are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Each layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably built by first defining any internal and external object boundaries of that layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, then hatching solid areas of object <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. If a particular part of a particular layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is to form a boundary of a void in the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> above or below that layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, then the laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is scanned in a series of closely-spaced, parallel vectors so as to develop a continuous surface or skin with improved strength and resolution. The time it takes to form each layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> depends upon its geometry, surface tension and viscosity of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thickness <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the layer, and laser scanning speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In practicing the present invention, the stereolithography apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a commercially available STL system which is modified by the invention to enable smoothing of vertical sides <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of STL-formed structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For example and not by way of limitation, the SLA-250/50HR, SLA-5000 and SLA-7000 stereolithography systems, each offered by 3D Systems, Inc, of Valencia, Calif., are suitable for modification. Liquid photopolymers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> believed to be suitable for use in practicing the present invention include Cibatool SL 5170 and SL 5210 resins for the SLA-250/50HR system, Cibatool SL 5530 resin for the SLA-5000 system, and Cibatool SL 7510 resin for the 7000 system. All of these resins are available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation. By way of example and not limitation, the layer thickness of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be formed, for purposes of the invention, may be on the order of about 0.0001 to about 0.030 inch, and more preferably, from about 0.001 to about 0.020 inch, with a high degree of uniformity over a field on a surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of a platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having differing thicknesses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be used to construct a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, so as to form a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of a precise, intended total height <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or to provide different material thicknesses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for different portions of the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The size of the laser beam &ldquo;spot&rdquo; <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> impinging on the surface of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to cure same may generally be on the order of 0.002 inch to 0.008 inch, using presently available STL equipment. Resolution is preferably about &plusmn;0.0003 inch in the X-Y plane (parallel to surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) over at least a 0.5 inch&times;0.25 inch field from a center point, permitting a high resolution scan effectively across a 1.0 inch&times;0.5 inch area. Of course, it is desirable to have substantially this high a resolution across the entirety of surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be scanned by laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This area may be termed the &ldquo;field of exposure&rdquo;, such area being substantially coextensive with the vision field of a machine vision system employed in the apparatus of the invention as explained in more detail below. The longer and more effectively vertical the path of laser beam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the greater the achievable resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings, it should be noted that apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention includes a camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which is in communication with computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and preferably located, as shown, in close proximity to optics and scan controller, i.e., reflective apparatus <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> located above surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be any one of a number of commercially available cameras, such as capacitive-coupled discharge (CCD) cameras available from a number of vendors. Suitable circuitry as required for adapting the output of camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for use by computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be incorporated in a board <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> installed in computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is programmed as known in the art to respond to images generated by camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and processed by board <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and board <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may together comprise a so-called &ldquo;machine vision system&rdquo;, and specifically, a &ldquo;pattern recognition system&rdquo; (PRS), operation of which will be described briefly below for a better understanding of the present invention. Alternately, a self-contained machine vision system available from a commercial vendor of such equipment may be employed. For example, and without limitation, such systems are available from Cognex Corporation of Natick, Mass. For example, the apparatus of the Cognex BGA Inspection Package&trade; or the SMD Placement Guidance Package&trade; may be adapted to the present invention, although it is believed that the MVS-8000&trade; product family and the Checkpoint&reg; product line, the latter employed in combination with Cognex PatMax&trade; software, may be especially suitable for use in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is noted that a variety of machine vision systems are in existence, examples of which and their structures and uses are described, without limitation, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,526,646; 4,543,659; 4,736,437; 4,899,921; 5,059,559; 5,113,565; 5,145,099; 5,238,174; 5,463,227; 5,288,698; 5,471,310; 5,506,684; 5,516,023; 5,516,026; and 5,644,245. The disclosure of each of the immediately foregoing references is hereby incorporated by this reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate practice of the present invention with apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a data file representative of the size, configuration, thickness and surface topography of a pre-existing object <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, for example, a particular type and design of semiconductor die to be packaged, is placed in the memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the pre-existing object <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, i.e., die, is to be packaged with a leadframe, data representative of the die with attached and electrically connected leadframe is provided. If packaging material in the form of the aforementioned photopolymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is to be applied only to an upper surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (or portions thereof excluding active surface structures <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>) of a die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to form upper package surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, or to the upper surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and portions or all of the side surfaces <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of a die, a large plurality of such dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be placed on surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for packaging, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. If package sides <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are to be formed, it is desirable that the surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprise, or be coated or covered with, a material from which the at least partially cured material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> defining the lowermost layers of the package side wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be easily released to prevent damage to the packaging. Alternatively, a solvent may be employed to release the package side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> from platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> after packaging is completed. Such release and solvent materials are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,822 referenced above and previously incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Following mounting of the dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is then activated to locate the position and orientation of each die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to be packaged by scanning platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and comparing the features of the dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with those in the data file residing in memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the locational and orientational data for each die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> then also being stored in memory. It should be noted that the data file representing the design size, shape and topography for the dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be used at this juncture to detect physically defective or damaged dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> prior to packaging and to automatically delete such dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from the packaging operation. It should also be noted that data files for more than one type (size, thickness, configuration, surface topography) of die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be placed in computer memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> programmed to recognize not only die locations and orientations, but which type of die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is at each location so that material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be cured by laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the correct pattern and to the height required to define package side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and to provide a package top surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> at the correct level and of the correct size and shape over each die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Continuing with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 1A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B of the drawings, dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may then be partially submerged below the surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to a depth the same as, or greater than, the thickness of a first layer of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be at least partially cured to a semisolid state to form the lowest layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A of a package side wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> about each of dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and then raised to a depth equal to the layer thickness, the surface of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> being allowed to settle. The material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> selected for use in packaging dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be one of the above-referenced resins from Ciba Specialty Chemical Company which exhibits a desirable dielectric constant, is of sufficient (semiconductor grade) purity, and which is of sufficiently similar coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) so that the package structure, i.e., structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, itself is not stressed during thermal cycling in testing and subsequent normal operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then activated and scanned to direct beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, under control of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, about the periphery of each die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to effect the aforementioned partial cure of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to form a first layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A. The platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then lowered into reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and raised to another side wall layer thickness-equaling depth increment <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> activated to add another side wall layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B. This sequence continues, layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, until the package side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are built up about dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. A final layer or layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be applied over a portion or the entirety of the upper surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, forming an upper package surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> thereon. The layer thicknesses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be controlled to differ, depending upon the thickness required for the top of the package. For example, a greater total thickness of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be required to cover a die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> having wire bonds protruding upwardly therefrom than if a die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is covered before connection to a leadframe. It should also be noted that the total thickness of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> over a selected portion of a given die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be altered die by die, again responsive to output of camera <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> or one or more additional cameras <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, shown in broken lines, detecting the protrusion of unusually high wire bond loops or other features projecting above the active surface of a given die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which should be, but is not, covered by the &ldquo;design&rdquo; or preprogrammed thickness of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> disposed over and at least partially cured on upper die surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. In any case, laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is again activated to at least partially cure material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> residing over each die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to form a package top <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of one or more layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, top <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> being substantially contiguous with package side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is controlled as desired to avoid certain surface features on dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, such as bond pads, which are intended to be exposed for connection to higher-level packaging by wire bonding, tape automated bonding (TAB) using flex circuits, or the use of projecting conductive connectors such as solder bumps in a &ldquo;flip-chip&rdquo; configuration. It should also be noted that the package top <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> may be formed within an outer boundary defined by side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extending above upper (active) surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and forming a dam thereabout. In this instance, the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be submerged so that material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> enters the area within the dam, raised above surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and then laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> activated and scanned to at least partially cure material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> residing within the dam. Alternatively, a &ldquo;skin&rdquo; may be cured by STL over the top surface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and liquid polymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> entrapped thereby will be subsequently cured in a final curing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When the final layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is formed to complete a selected portion of the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is elevated above surface level <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and excess liquid <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is drained from the STL-formed structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. At this stage, depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the surfaces <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of vertical sides <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the at least partially polymerized structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be somewhat nonplanar, having linear, slit-like, external horizontal crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at the interfaces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> between adjacent layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>D, as well as between layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A and platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A meniscus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprising a quantity of unpolymerized liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is retained or trapped within each crevice <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Where the vertical sides <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> meet the die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, similar interior crevices <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> may occur along the layer interfaces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, being filled with unpolymerized photopolymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is trapped therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Where the initial lack of planarity of the surfaces <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the vertical sides <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be tolerated, the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be washed to remove all unpolymerized material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the external surfaces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, including the external crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The washed structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, being free of liquid photopolymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the external crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that at this stage, the polymer comprising structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is typically in various stages of polymerization, including liquid polymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> trapped in internal crevices <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the uppermost layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>D may comprise a polymerized &ldquo;skin&rdquo; which traps unpolymerized or partially polymerized material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> therebelow. Following removal of the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a final curing step polymerizes and consolidates the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, including any liquid polymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the internal crevices <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> or otherwise trapped within the structure. As exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, empty external crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> remain in the side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the package, i.e., structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, following removal from the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and full cure of the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> reduce the effective side wall thickness <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) and represent potential weaknesses in the packaging <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Dust, other debris and moisture may collect in the crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The method and apparatus of the present invention pertain to the stereolithographic polymerization of liquid polymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> retained in external crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> shadowed by overlying polymerized layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of a structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed by STL, whereby the side wall surfaces <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are made smooth. The smoothing method is enabled by certain modifications to conventional STL apparatus, described infra. The smoothing fills the crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to a depth approaching the flat side wall surfaces <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, thus removing locations where dust and moisture may collect. Smoothing also increases the effective thickness of the protective layer over the die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for uniform protection, increases resistance of the formed structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to damage and environmental contamination by providing a stronger structure, reduces waste of polymeric material, and is aesthetically preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, removal of the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from the liquid photopolymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is followed by draining of excess material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> therefrom, resulting in the configuration depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Residual liquid photopolymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> retained in the external crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and having outer meniscus surfaces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is not removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on which the object <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed is then reoriented or tilted about a horizontal axis <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to an acute angle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> from the horizon. Crevice <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with liquid meniscus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a vertical side <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is then irradiated by scanning of the laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at incidence angle <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to polymerize the photopolymer. At a minimum, a thin &ldquo;skin&rdquo; <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of partially polymerized material must be formed to contain any additional unpolymerized liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> during subsequent washing (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Polymerization of the meniscus liquid <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> results in a smooth surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the vertical side <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The incident laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is generally in a vertical orientation, whereby the angle of incidence <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> between beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the side surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is equal to angle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and may be any acute angle between about 5 degrees and about 90 degrees. The preferred angle of incidence <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is between about 10 degrees and about 60 degrees. The desirable angle of incidence <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to achieve a smooth, fully polymerized surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> depends upon the depth of the crevice <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the concavity or convexity of the liquid meniscus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the degree to which the liquid meniscus is shadowed by the overlying layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the side surfaces <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are smoothed by the tilted STL formation of &ldquo;skins&rdquo; <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of polymerized photopolymer, which typically entrap unpolymerized material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in internal pockets <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The formation of a surface skin <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> avoids the use of a high incidence angle <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> such as&gt;60 degrees to reach the innermost portions of the crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and is achieved with minimum laser energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Following the STL smoothing step, any excess uncured liquid material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> residing on the surfaces of structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be manually removed and structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may then be solvent-cleaned and removed from platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, usually by cutting it free of base supports (not shown). Structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will then be generally subjected to postcuring, as material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is typically only partially polymerized and exhibits only a portion (typically 40% to 60%) of its fully cured strength. Postcuring to enhance and accelerate consolidation and complete hardening of structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be effected in another apparatus projecting broad-source UV radiation in a continuous manner over structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and/or by thermal completion of the initial, UV-initiated partial cure, and/or by other curing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In this manner, a structure, i.e., package <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, may be formed with smooth, uniform thickness side wall surfaces <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in minimal time within apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and, optionally, a final cure apparatus such as is well known in the art. In instances where a plurality of structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are formed on a relatively large platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it is desirable that platform actuator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have the capability of horizontally translating platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> above the top of reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and while in a tilted position to place tilted walls of each structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> directly below laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</cross-reference>, a preferred embodiment of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is precisely movable in a vertical direction, i.e., along vertical axis Z, and may be tilted vertically about a horizontal axis or axes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). In a further preferred embodiment, platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is also rotatable about an axis <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> normal to the platform surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, once the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is tilted to a desired incidence angle, it may then be rotated about axis <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to present each side wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in turn to the substantially vertical laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be scanned over each longitudinal crevice <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of a selected side wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> before the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates for presentation of the next side wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Thus, the number of tilting operations and scanning steps may be minimized. Alternately, the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be configured to be first rotated about an axis <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to a desired position and then tilted about horizontal axis <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The platform may then be rotated further about axis <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as desired to present additional side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be righted to a horizontal position after each side wall <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> facing in a particular direction is exposed to laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, rotated about axis <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and then re-tilted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It should be recognized that where a plurality of structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are formed with varying configurations on a platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an initial tilting step followed by platform rotation and X-Y laser scanning of each object is readily accomplished. The (a) tilting, rotation and Z axis movement of the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and (b) the scanning operations of the laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are both controlled by a computer program using the data file already present in the computer memory <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As previously described, such data may include, for example, at least one parameter such as the size, configuration, thickness and surface topography of each device to be packaged, together with the construction details of the package to be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The STL smoothing step may be performed by merely lifting the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> above the photopolymer reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, tilting and scanning within apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Incident or reflected laser radiation from the smoothing step may be directed undesirably downwardly into the reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an opaque member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is provided which is movable across the reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to shield liquid photopolymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from reflected or incident laser radiation during the smoothing step. The opaque member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> must be opaque to laser radiation and be resistant to damage therefrom. The opaque member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may comprise a somewhat flexible roll of material or a rigid plate which slides over the reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for example. Where the smoothing step is not performed adjacent the reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, use of the opaque member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is not required. Such is the case if the smoothing step is performed by a separate laser apparatus or the reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is removed from STL apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> prior to the smoothing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> While the smoothing step has been described above in the context of using a laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> scanned along crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, it will be appreciated that a broad beam or flood type radiation source of appropriate wavelength or wavelength range may be used to expose liquid photopolymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in all crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> facing in a given direction at the same time. Moreover, simultaneous exposure of all side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for smoothing might be accomplished either within or outside apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the use of a plurality of broad beam or flood type radiation sources surrounding and above platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or other supporting platform and facing downwardly at an appropriate angle. Of course, the severity of the angle required for orientation of the radiation sources would depend on the spacing between adjacent structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing example of the invention shows the packaging of a die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the top <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and sides <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the die bottom <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) may also be stereolithographically packaged in a variety of configurations to effect substantially complete sealing of the die. For example, the dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be placed bottom <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> down on an insulative material which will comprise the bottom packaging and STL used to construct the side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> using the insulative material as a base. Alternatively, a package bottom is first formed on the platform <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by stereolithography, the die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is placed on the package bottom, and the STL process is continued to erect the side walls <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In yet another variation, where a plurality of dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are secured and electrically connected (as by wire bonding, thermocompression bonding, TAB bonding or otherwise as known in the art) to leadframes, the leadframe may be inverted to form the bottom packaging by STL. In still another variation, dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be encapsulated on five sides and then inverted and encapsulated on the sixth, whether it be a &ldquo;top&rdquo;, bottom&rdquo; or &ldquo;side&rdquo;. Using machine vision systems, mere inversion of the dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> after all but one side of each is covered and reinitiation of laser scanning may be used to complete the packages. If certain die features such as bond pads, solder bumps, etc., are to remain unencapsulated, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be programmed to recognize and avoid such features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> While the prior discussion describes the invention in terms of the packaging of the top <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and four lateral sides <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of a semiconductor die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the method of the present invention is more broadly applicable to the formation of any structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is formed from a photopolymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by stereolithography. Thus, the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may stand alone or be attached to or adjacent to another object such as a die <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The small size of semiconductor devices makes the use of stereolithography particularly advantageous for forming protective packaging and other structures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on devices and electronic substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> It is notable that the method of the present invention produces a substantially smooth side wall surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> without consuming any additional photopolymer in comparison to not using the inventive method, and in fact, may enable (due to enhanced uniformity of wall thickness) a die package wall to be formed with a reduced thickness <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, further reducing the already small quantity of polymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> consumed in stereolithographic packaging. In addition, the capital equipment expense of transfer molding processes is eliminated and the inventive method is extremely frugal in its use of dielectric encapsulant material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, since all such material in which cure is not initiated by laser <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> remains in a liquid state in reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for use in packaging the next plurality of dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or other objects. Further, since it is no longer necessary to encapsulate dice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with packaging of sufficient wall thickness to accommodate relatively large dimensional variations such as those which may be exhibited by wire bond loop heights, the overall volume of packaging material may be smaller in some cases. Also, the package dimensional tolerances achievable through use of the present invention are increased in precision in comparison to transfer molded packaging. Moreover, there is no potential for mold damage, mold wear, or requirement for mold refurbishment. Finally, the extended cure times at elevated temperatures for transfer molded packaging, on the order of, for example, four hours at 175&deg; C., required after removal of batches of dice from the transfer mold cavities, are eliminated. Post-cure of die packages formed according to the present invention may be effected with broad-source UV radiation emanating from, for example, flood lights in a chamber through which dice are moved on a conveyor or in large batches. Curing in an oven at, for example, 160&deg; C., is another option which effects full curing of liquid polymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in interior crevices <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and internal pockets <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Full curing of unpolymerized material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> retained in the crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> without a prior skin formation is not practical because, without a prior solvent wash, droplets and films of liquid material persist on the surfaces of the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As a result, full curing without a prior solvent wash results in substantially nonuniform side wall surfaces <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and upper surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. If the structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is first solvent-washed without &ldquo;skinning&rdquo; of the meniscus photopolymer material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the liquid polymer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is washed from the crevices <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> so the crevices remain after full cure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that the packaging method of the present invention is conducted at substantially ambient temperature, the small beam spot size and rapid traverse of laser beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> around and over the structures <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> resulting in negligible thermal stress thereon. Physical stress on structures <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, i.e., the semiconductor dice and associated leadframes and bare wires, is also significantly reduced, in that material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fixed in place and not moved over the dice in a viscous, high-pressure wave front as in transfer molding, followed by cooling-induced stressing of the package. Bond wire sweep is eliminated, as is any tendency to drive particulates in the polymer encapsulant between lead fingers and an underlying portion of the active surface of the die with consequent damage to the integrity of the active surface. </paragraph>
