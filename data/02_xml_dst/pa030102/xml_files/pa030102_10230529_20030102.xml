<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A knee prosthesis and method for use are provided, in which the knee prosthesis provides anterior and posterior stability and controlled femoral roll-back, while also providing rotational kinematics. The femoral component has a pair of convexly shaped condyles which are spaced apart to form an intercondylar notch. Anterior and posterior cams are provided within the notch. The tibial component comprises a platform upon which a tibial bearing is mounted to provide for rotational movement about the tibial axis. The tibial bearing is provided with surfaces to engage the condyles and has an upwardly extending spine which is positioned to engage the anterior and posterior femoral cams. At full extension, the spine engages the anterior femoral cam to provide a 3&deg; hyperextension stop. Between full extension and approximately 50&deg; of flexion, the spine is free to translate between the anterior and posterior femoral cams. From 50&deg; to 120&deg; of flexion, the spine engages the posterior femoral cam, which provides femoral roll-back and posterior stability. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a knee prosthesis and more particularly to the provision of a knee prosthesis comprising a rotating bearing on the tibial platform with a spine for posterior stabilization of the anterior-posterior translation of the femoral component relative to the tibial component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The prior art includes various examples of knee prostheses. Examples of posterior stabilized knee prostheses can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,298,992 and 5,147,405. Also, examples of knee prostheses which provide a rotational bearing can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,470,158 and 5,395,401. These references are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a knee prosthesis comprising a femoral component adapted to be implanted on the condylar portions of the femur and having a pair of laterally spaced-apart condylar portions, each of which has an external surface that is preferably smoothly convexly curved in the antero-posterior direction and generally matches the shapes in lateral profile of condylar surfaces of the femur. These condylar surfaces are preferably smoothly convexly curved in all cross-sections along their antero-posterior extent, and the intercondylar portion connecting the condylar portions defines an intercondylar notch having spaced-apart lateral surfaces or walls. This intercondylar notch may preferably be a box-like housing having spaced-apart lateral side walls and an open roof. Within this notch, the femoral component preferably provides an anterior femoral cam and a posterior femoral cam. The prosthesis further comprises a tibial component adapted to be implanted on the tibial platform and including a bearing having on its superior surface a pair of laterally spaced-apart concavities or bearing surfaces, each of which is adapted to receive in nested relation one of the condylar portions of the femoral component. This bearing is preferably formed to include a superior extending spine to be received in the intercondylar notch of the femoral component. The spine preferably has lateral surfaces, an anterior tibial cam, and a posterior tibial cam. A platform is provided to be rigidly attached to the proximal end of the tibia to provide a surface upon which the bearing rotates about an axis generally aligned with the tibia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the relative positions and shapes of the spine and the intercondylar notch of the prosthesis as implanted into the knee joint are such that, when the leg is at or near full extension, where the femur tends to dislocate posteriorly relative to the tibia, the anterior femoral and tibial cams engage each other to prevent posterior dislocation of the femoral component. When the leg is partly flexed, the femoral and tibial cams are spaced-apart from each other and permit relatively free antero-posterior translation of the components but are available to restrain excessive anterior and posterior movements. From approximately 40&deg; to 60&deg; of flexion to approximately 120&deg; of flexion, the posterior femoral and tibial cams engage and bear on each other. Preferably, the posterior cams engage from approximately 50&deg; to approximately 120&deg; of flexion. During this flexion, the tibial cam prevents the femoral component from moving anteriorly, and the tibio-femoral contact shifts posteriorly. This femoral roll-back theoretically provides for increased range of motion and improved quadriceps efficiency at deeper flexion angles. Further, preferably, the relative positions and shapes of the posterior femoral and tibial cams of the prosthesis as implanted in the knee joint are such that, when the leg approaches full flexion, the tibial cam is of sufficient height to prevent anterior dislocation of the femoral component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a method for controlling the antero-posterior translation of a knee prosthesis comprising the steps of providing a femoral component and attaching the femoral component to a femur at its distal end. The femoral component has condyle surfaces which are spaced apart to define a notch therebetween and a femoral anterior cam and a femoral posterior cam disposed in the notch. A tibial component is provided to be attached to the tibia at its proximal end and the tibial component comprises a platform to be attached to the tibia and a bearing mounted on the platform for rotational movement about an axis extending generally in the direction of the tibia. In the method of the present invention, the bearing is formed to provide bearing surfaces for movably supporting the femoral component condyle surfaces. The bearing is also provided with a spine extending superiorly (upwardly) into the notch between the condyle surfaces. This spine is provided for engaging the femoral anterior posterior cams to provide anterior and posterior stability and femoral roll-back. Also, the spine is of sufficient size to provide an adequate subluxation height. The tibial anterior cam preferably inclines upwardly from the anterior portion of the bearing, and the tibial posterior cam preferably inclines downwardly from the peak at a point adjacent the axis of rotation of the bearing and generally parallel to the rotational axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The illustrative tibial anterior cam surface inclines upward slightly from the anterior most portion of the bearing to a point at which the inclination is about 40&deg; to 50&deg; up to the peak of the spine. The illustrative femoral anterior cam is convexly curved to have a curve portion generally aligned with the more inclined portion of the tibial anterior cam from said point to the peak when the knee is at full extension. The femoral posterior cam is also convexly curved, and it is placed to engage the tibial posterior cam when the knee is at about 40&deg; to 60&deg; of flexion, preferably at about 50&deg; of flexion. At that point, the tibial posterior cam prevents the femoral component from further anterior translation. From 40&deg; to 60&deg; of flexion to 120&deg; of flexion, the femoral posterior cam continues to engage the tibial posterior cam, and roll-back occurs during such flexion. Preferably, a spine is provided of sufficient height to reduce the possibility of dislocation from approximately 90&deg; to 120&deg; of flexion.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring specifically to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it will be seen that a knee system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention comprises a femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a tibial component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The tibial component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a tibial platform <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from which a tibial stem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extends downwardly, and a bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which mounts on platform <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the tibial platform <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided with a socket <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extending downwardly from an opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the platform, for receiving a stem <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which extends downwardly from the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Also as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the stem <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided with a generally cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which rotatably seats in a generally cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of socket <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and stem <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> terminates in a distal tapered portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which seats in a mating distal tapered portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of socket <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. However, it will be understood that stem <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and socket <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> need not be provided with such cylindrical and tapered portions. Other mounting configurations which allow for relatively free rotational movement are within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the illustrative tibial stem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provided with radially spaced-apart, downwardly extending ridges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which extend toward a distal tip <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the stem and which terminate as indicated at <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. These radially spaced-apart ridges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> serve to anchor the tibial component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the tibia against rotation about the axis of the stem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It is well known that the stem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be provided with a porous metal coating into which the bone of the tibia will grow to hold the tibial component in position in the tibia. It is also well known that the tibial component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be cemented within the tibia. Other configurations and techniques for anchoring tibial component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a tibia are known and are within the scope of this invention. The tibial platform <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides an upper platform surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which serves as a bearing surface to support a bottom surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is permitted to rotate about the axis <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>) of its stem <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which is received in the socket <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Such bearings are known as rotary bearings in that the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can move rotationally relative to the tibial platform <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is anchored to the tibia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the perspective view of the upper portion of the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it will be seen that the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided with bearing surfaces <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for supporting condyle bearings <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Bearing surfaces <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be configured in a number of manners, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,309,778, 4,340,978, and 4,470,158, which are hereby incorporated by reference. A spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, sometimes referred to as an eminence or post, is located between the bearing surfaces <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and is provided with sides <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extending upwardly. The spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is also provided with an anterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, a posterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and a peak <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> therebetween. A ramp <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is located posteriorly of the spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to incline upwardly to a posterior end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The posterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the ramp <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> join to provide a notch or smooth transition <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, also best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Referring further to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the anterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is a ramp-like surface beginning near the anterior portion of the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and ramping upwardly and rearwardly to the peak of the spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Initially, near an anterior end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the anterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> inclines slightly upwardly, and further back the anterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>inclined at an angle &agr; of about 40&deg; to 50&deg; relative to plane x. Plane x may be thought of as coincident with surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that contacts platform <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or, alternatively, may be thought of as a plane generally perpendicular to the axis of stem <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if the prosthesis is implanted in a patient whose leg is positioned at full extension as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> on a flat level surface, plane x may be thought of as parallel to that flat level surface. In the illustrative embodiment, angle &agr; is about 45&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative embodiment, posterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> extends essentially linearly in the proximal-distal direction from peak <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to transition <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In particular, as shown in the side elevational views of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the posterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> defines a vertically extending line <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> which is arranged to be coincident with, or otherwise coaxially arranged with, the rotary axis <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, posterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may be curved in any number of ways and still provide a suitable surface for providing roll-back and posterior stability. Such alternative spine configurations are within the scope and spirit of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is conventionally formed to have an anterior portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and a posterior portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> providing condyles or condyle bearings <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> for movably engaging bearing surfaces <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferred embodiments may be found in the &apos;778 and &apos;978 patents, which were discussed above and incorporated by reference. Conventionally, the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be made from a suitable metal, while the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be made from a plastic material such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). The prior art references referred to above describe the nature of the acceptable prosthesis implant metals and plastics. The condyle bearings <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> will have radii of curvature to provide appropriate contact between the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and tibial component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as discussed in the prior art. It will be appreciated that, while at full extension as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the condyle bearings <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are more congruent with the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> surfaces <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> than when the knee is at 120&deg; of flexion, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. At 120&deg; of flexion, only the posterior-most portion of the condyle bearings <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> will be in contact with the bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> surfaces <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and the contact point will be shifted posteriorly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It will further be appreciated that in typical knee action, there is considerable anterior-posterior movement of the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the tibial component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the anterior direction being represented by the arrow &ldquo;A&rdquo; and the posterior direction being represented by the arrow &ldquo;P&rdquo; in the drawings. According to this invention, this translation of the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> relative to the tibial component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is controlled as the knee moves between full extension and full flexion. This control is provided by the spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with its cams <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extends upwardly into an intercondylar notch <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, which is located between condyle bearings <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Inside this intercondylar notch <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is an anterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a posterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for engaging, respectively, the anterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and posterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This relationship is best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the anterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is convex and extends distally from the anterior portion of a roof <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the intercondylar notch <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the posterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is similarly convex and extends distally from the posterior part of roof <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the intercondylar notch <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, interior walls <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the intercondylar notch <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are provided by a cam housing formed by sides <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and roof <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which illustratively has a square aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> formed therein. The femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be cemented to the resected femur or the femoral component may be coated with a porous material for bone ingrowth. Alternatively, a stem-like fastening component (not shown) may extend upwardly through aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to secure femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the femur. In a preferred embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the flat roof may be omitted, and a proximal end <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the intercondylar notch <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> may be defined only by a proximal surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of anterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a proximal surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of posterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a proximal edge <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of side <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and a proximal edge <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of side <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that this preferred configuration provides additional space for spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> without resecting additional bone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The manner in which the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be mounted on the distal end of a femur is well known and need not be described in detail for those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In operation, the anterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and posterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> articulates with the spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the tibial bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to provide posterior stability. Stated alternatively, the spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> articulates with anterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and posterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of femur component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to provide stability. In the fully extended position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the anterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> engages with the anterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to provide, for example, a 3&deg; hyperextension stop. The posterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> engages posterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at about 40&deg; to 60&deg; of flexion, preferably at about 50&deg; of flexion. Normal weight bearing gait involves flexion angles of approximately 40&deg; or less. Thus, for the weight bearing phase of walking, the spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> does not engage the posterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. During activities involving flexion angles greater than about 40&deg; to 60&deg;, such as stair climbing or rising from a chair, the posterior tibial cam <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> engages the posterior femoral cam <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, providing posterior stability and femoral roll-back, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. Femoral roll-back is the posterior shift of the tibio-femoral contact point as the knee bends from full extension (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) to deep flexion (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). As illustrated, the knee system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides for approximately 11 mm of femoral roll-back on a medium sized prosthesis. Preferably, this roll-back, combined with the rotary feature, provides continuous medial and lateral contact between the femoral and tibial bearings surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> One element considered in the design of the traditional posterior stabilized knees is the subluxation height. This is defined as the distance the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> must raise up to sublux or jump over the top of tibial spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> during flexion (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), the maximum subluxation being indicated at <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, maximum subluxation <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is the distance from a distal-most portion <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a corresponding location <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on bearing surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would ordinarily engage at full roll-back. Of course, when the condition depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> occurs, dislocation may occur if laxity of collateral ligaments in flexion allows the knee prosthesis to exceed the subluxation height of the design. For example, for a medium sized prosthesis, a subluxation height <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of 15.4 mm at 90&deg; and 14.5 mm at 120&deg; of flexion (deep flexion is when the dislocation complication occurs) may be suitable. It will be seen that subluxation height <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is measured from the point indicated at <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> on the condyle bearing <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to the location <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on the bearing surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The surgery techniques for installing the knee system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be similar to well known surgical techniques used for installing knees with rotating platform or deep dish bearing components. It will be clear that an exception to this is that the trochlear recessing cut made with the finishing guide for the femur may be cut deeper to provide clearance in the distal femoral bone for the intercondylar notch <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the femoral component <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The larger intercondylar notch <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, in turn, accommodates a taller tibial spine <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which provides the larger subluxation height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been shown and described in detail, the same is by way of example only and not by way of limitation. Numerous changes can be made to the embodiments shown and described without departing from the spirit and scope if the invention. Accordingly, the present invention is to be limited only by the terms of the claims appended hereto. </paragraph>
