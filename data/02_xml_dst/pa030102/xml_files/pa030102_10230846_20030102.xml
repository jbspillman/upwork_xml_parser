<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to removing liquid from wafers, and more particularly to apparatus and methods for drying a wafer that has been wet in a liquid bath, after which the wafer and the bath are separated at a controlled rate to form a thin layer of liquid on the wafer as the wafer is positioned in a gas-filled volume, wherein the volume is defined by a hot chamber that continuously transfers thermal energy to the wafer in the volume, and wherein hot gas directed into the volume and across the wafer and out of the volume continuously transfers thermal energy to the wafer, so that the thermal energy transferred to the wafer in the volume evaporates the thin layer from the wafer without decreasing the rate of separation of the wafer and the bath below a maximum rate of such separation at which a meniscus will form between the bath and the surface of the wafer during such separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the manufacture of semiconductor devices, process chambers are interfaced to permit transfer of wafers between the interfaced chambers. Such wafer transfer is via transport modules that move the wafers, for example, through slots or ports that are provided in the adjacent walls of the interfaced chambers. For example, transport modules are generally used in conjunction with a variety of wafer processing modules, which may include semiconductor etching systems, material deposition systems, flat panel display etching systems, and wafer cleaning systems. Due to growing demands for cleanliness and high processing precision, there has been a greater need to reduce the amount of human interaction during, between, and after such processing steps. This need has been partially met with the implementation of vacuum transport modules which operate as an intermediate wafer handling apparatus (typically maintained at a reduced pressure, e.g., vacuum conditions). By way of example, a vacuum transport module may be physically located between one or more clean room storage facilities where wafers are stored, and multiple wafer processing modules where the wafers are actually processed, e.g., etched or have deposition performed thereon, or cleaned. In this manner, when a wafer is required for processing, a robot arm located within the transport module may be employed to retrieve a selected wafer from storage and place it into one of the multiple processing modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Despite use of such intermediate wafer handling apparatus, it is still necessary to clean and dry the wafers at the completion of such processing. As an example, after the wafers have been cleaned, the wafers may have a non-uniform coating of liquid. A wafer with such non-uniform coating of liquid, or with one or more drops of liquid thereon, or with any liquid thereon in any physical form, may be said to be &ldquo;wet&rdquo;. In contrast, a wafer having a uniform coating of liquid may be said to be &ldquo;uniformly wet&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the past, annular-shaped pieceparts other than wafers have been subjected to a drying operation. After cleaning and while wet, such pieceparts have been placed in a tank containing a bath of hot liquid. In one type of drying operation, the hot liquid has been drained from the tank at a rate such that a thin layer of liquid, rather than one or more drops of liquid, forms on that portion of such piecepart that is out of the draining liquid. The thin layer has been preferred over one or more drops because a drop of liquid has a high volume, e.g., from about 0.001 ml. to about 0.020 ml. In comparison to the drop, a thin layer of liquid on a wafer such as a 200 mm. diameter wafer, may only have a volume at the maximum diameter of about 0.133 of 0.0105 ml., which is the middle of the above volume range of the drop, for example. Evaporation of a drop generally results in the concentration of small particles at the last small point at which the drop exists. When the piecepart is a wafer, such concentration may result in defects in a chip made from the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To remove the thin layer from such piecepart, reliance has been placed on the thermal energy stored in such piecepart to provide the thermal energy necessary to evaporate the thin layer. However, when such pieceparts are &ldquo;wafers&rdquo;, as defined above, problems have been experienced in not properly drying the thin layer from the wafer. For example, it appears that using only such stored thermal energy, the thin layer evaporates from the wafer at a rate less than the maximum rate of separation of the liquid bath and the wafer at which a meniscus will form between the liquid bath and the surface of the wafer during such separation. Thus, the rate at which the liquid is drained from the tank has to be decreased to match the rate of evaporation. Alternatively, the wafer would have to be retained in the tank after the draining has been completed. Each of such decreased rate of draining and such retaining increases the time required to dry the wafer, which increases the cost of fabricating devices based on the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In view of the forgoing, what is needed is apparatus and methods of efficiently drying wafers. Such efficient drying should allow the wafers and the liquid to be separated at a rate no less than the maximum rate of separation of the liquid and the wafer at which a meniscus will form between the liquid bath and the surface of the wafer. Also, the efficient drying should rapidly remove from the wafer a thin layer of liquid that forms on the wafer as the wafer and the bath are separated, wherein &ldquo;rapidly&rdquo; means such removal occurs before the wafer and the bath have been completely separated e.g., separated by about 0.004 inches. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Broadly speaking, the present invention fills these needs by providing apparatus and methods of efficiently removing fluid from wafers. The efficient removing is attained by providing apparatus and methods for drying a wafer that has been uniformly wet in a fluid bath, in which the wafer and the bath are separated at a controlled rate to form a thin layer of fluid on the wafer as the wafer is positioned in a gas-filled volume. In addition to such separation, the efficient removing is attained by defining the gas-filled volume by use of a hot chamber that continuously transfers thermal energy to the wafer in the volume. Further, hot gas directed into the volume and across the wafer and out of the volume continuously transfers thermal energy to the wafer. The directing of the gas out of the volume is independent of the separation of the bath and the wafer. The thermal energy transferred to the wafer in the volume evaporates the thin layer from the wafer without decreasing the rate of separation of the wafer and the bath below the maximum rate of such separation at which a meniscus will form between the bath and the surface of the wafer during such separation. In addition to such separation and directing of the hot gas across the wafer and out of the volume, the relative humidity in the volume is kept low to inhibit recondensation of the fluid on the wafers, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Such efficient removal enables the wafer throughput of such apparatus and method to be limited only by the type of wafer that is being dried, and the type of fluid used to wet the wafer. For example, the characteristics of particular types of wafers and fluid dictate the maximum rate of such separation of the wafer and the bath at which a meniscus will form between the bath and the surface of the wafer during such separation and the wafer will be uniformly wet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention a wafer drying system may include a bath enclosure configured to hold a fluid so that the fluid defines a top fluid surface. A temperature and humidity-controlled chamber may also be defined above the fluid surface. The chamber has a first opening at a first side proximate to the fluid surface and a second opening at a second side that is opposite to the first side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention the wafers to be dried have opposite sides, and apparatus for drying the wafers may include a bath containing hot liquid, wherein the liquid defines an upper surface. Also provided is an enclosure having an inlet spaced from the upper surface and an outlet adjacent to the upper surface. The enclosure defines a continuous gas flow path from the inlet to the outlet, the flow path extending from the inlet along the upper surface and through the outlet. A heat transfer unit may supply hot gas to the inlet, with the hot gas being under pressure so as to flow in the continuous flow path. The heat transfer unit may transfer thermal energy to the enclosure so that the enclosure radiates thermal energy across the continuous flow path. A wafer carrier may be movable in the bath and in the enclosure for moving the wafer at a controlled rate out of the bath and into intersection with the continuous flow path. The rate may be controlled so that as the wafer moves out of the bath a thin layer of the liquid is formed on each of the opposite sides of the wafer. As the wafer intersects the continuous flow path thermal energy from the hot gas and from the enclosure is received by the wafer and by the thin layer. The received thermal energy evaporates the thin layer off the opposite sides of the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a related embodiment, the walls of the enclosure may define a perimeter of the enclosure. A plenum surrounds the perimeter of the enclosure for receiving the gas and the evaporated thin layer from the outlet. To assure that the flow path remains continuous and to control the relative humidity in the enclosure, a fan is provided for exhausting the gas, the evaporated thin layer, and vapor from the bath from the plenum. In a further embodiment, apparatus provided for drying a wafer having opposite planar sides may include a bath for containing a fluid having an upper surface. A heat transfer chamber may have a plurality of walls, each of the walls having a bottom at generally the same level as the level of adjacent ones of the walls. The chamber defines a wafer drying volume above the bottoms of the walls and within which a wafer drying path extends. At least one of the walls is provided with a gas inlet positioned opposite to the bottom. A support may suspend the chamber above the bath with the wafer drying path starting adjacent to the fluid surface and extending to a point adjacent to the gas inlet. The support positions the bottoms of the chamber walls spaced from the liquid surface to define an elongated outlet extending around the wafer drying path. A hot gas supply may be connected to the gas inlet for flowing hot gas through the chamber across the opposite planar sides of the wafer and out of the chamber through the elongated outlet to continuously transfer thermal energy at a selected temperature across the wafer drying path, and thus to the wafer and the thin film on the wafer. A heater connected to the chamber between the gas inlet and the elongated outlet may radiate thermal energy across the wafer drying path, and also to the wafer and the thin film on the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a still other embodiment, a method for drying a wafer may include an operation of introducing a wafer being in a wet state into a fluid bath. The wafer is removed from the fluid bath at a controlled rate along a selected path. Heated gas is applied to the wafer as the wafer is moved along the selected path and out of the fluid bath. Advantageously, the applied heated gas flows in at least one continuous flow path to the wafer without recirculating the heated gas to the wafer. In this manner, the applied heated gas transitions the wafer to a dry state as the wafer exits the fluid bath. A related feature is that thermal energy is radiated onto the wafer as the wafer moves along the selected path out of the fluid bath. In another related aspect of this method embodiment, an enclosure is provided to define the at least one continuous flow path. The applying of the heated gas may include flowing hot nitrogen in the at least one continuous flow path across the wafer to effect the transition by evaporating the fluid from the wafer into the hot nitrogen. The applying operation then removes the hot nitrogen and the evaporated fluid from the enclosure and away from the fluid bath. In this manner, the hot nitrogen and the evaporated fluid are not recirculated in the enclosure, such that the evaporated fluid does not accumulate, which accumulation would reduce the rate at which the evaporation takes place and foster recondensation of the fluid on the wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the present invention a method for drying a wafer may cause a wafer to be immersed in a fluid bath to wet opposite sides of the wafer with the fluid. Then the wafer is moved out of the fluid bath into a defined volume along a selected path. The moving may be controlled to allow a meniscus on each of the opposite sides to form and leave a thin film of the fluid on the opposite sides of the wafer as the wafer moves from the fluid bath. By directing radiant energy into the thin film of the fluid on the opposite sides of the wafer, and by flowing heated gas into the defined volume and along the wafer as the wafer is moved along the selected path out of the fluid bath, the thin film of the fluid is evaporated from the wafer and combines with the heated gas flowing along the wafer. An exit from the defined volume is provided for the combined removed thin film of the fluid and the gas. Advantageously, the combination of the radiant energy, the heated gas and the exit promote rapid evaporation of the thin film and foster a decrease in the time required to dry the wafers. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An invention is described for drying wafers. The invention is described in terms of apparatus for and methods of efficiently removing liquid from wafers. More particularly, the invention is described in respect to apparatus and methods for removing liquid from a wafer to dry the wafer after the wafer has been wet in a liquid bath. The removing of the liquid is initiated as the wafer and the bath are separated at a controlled rate to uniformly wet the wafer, i.e. to form a thin layer of liquid on a portion of the wafer that is out of the bath and in a hot-gas-filled volume defined by a hot chamber. The hot chamber and the hot gas continuously transfer thermal energy to the wafer and the thin layer as the wafer enters the volume. The removing of the liquid is completed as the wafer enters the volume, in that the thermal energy transferred to the wafer and to the thin layer rapidly evaporates the thin layer from the wafer. The evaporation is at a high enough rate that there is no decrease in the rate of separation of the wafer and the bath below the maximum rate of such separation at which a meniscus and the thin layer will form between the bath and the surface of the wafer during such separation. By controlling the relative humidity in the hot chamber, recondensation of the evaporated thin layer and condensation of vapor from the bath onto the wafer are inhibited. It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts an apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for drying wafers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The wafers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be of various diameters, such as two hundred mm. or three hundred mm., for example. Each wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has opposed flat or planar sides <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> extending parallel to a wafer axis <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and an edge <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> between the sides <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. To facilitate drying of the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, or drying many wafers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a wafer carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided for removing the one or more wafers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from a bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> under the control of an operating, or process control, panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> mounted on a housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and depicts the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> removing a dry wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from a drying enclosure or chamber <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> mounted above the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. An anti-static device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> assures that no static charge exists in the enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in plan view as including a hatch or cover <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that closes the drying enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> during a wafer drying operation. An opening <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in a top panel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is closed by the hatch <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which is removable to allow access to the interior of the enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</cross-reference> show that the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided with one or more grooves <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to hold the wafers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in position for a drying operation. Each groove <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> holds one wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the edge <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, i.e., in a vertical position with each opposite side <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the wafer axis <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> extending vertically. When the hatch <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> covers the opening, an arm <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> secured to the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> extends through a port <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in the hatch <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to facilitate moving the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a wafer or wafers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> carried in the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, within the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the gas-filled enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> along a wafer drying path <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

Preferably, the water <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is de-ionized. More preferably, the water <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is both de-ionized and filtered. Most preferably, the water <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is both de-ionized and passed through a very fine filter <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, and heated, before flowing into the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The filter <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may be a 0.05 micron PTFE filter made by Pall Corporation. The filter <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is designed to remove substantially all of the particles (not shown) from the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and typically leaves in the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> less than five particles greater than or equal to 0.03 microns per cubic centimeter of the filtered fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

That is, with such depth D, the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> will entirely cover the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and thus initially provide a uniform coating of fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> on each wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A fluid inlet <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and a fluid outlet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are provided to enable the filtered and heated fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to be circulated into the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and then out of the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for heating, filtering and return to the bath. </paragraph>

A stepper motor <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is mounted on the housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a servo motor (not shown) may be used. The stepper motor <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is designed to move the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from the initial position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> above the top panel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. At this initial position, the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is out of the enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, so that wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be inserted into the grooves <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are generally somewhat wet from a previous processing operation, but the material (not shown) that wets the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be on the planar sides <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the edge <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in a non-uniform manner. The stepper motor <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is also designed to quickly move the arm <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and thus the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, through the opening <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, into and through the enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and into the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to immerse the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> as described above.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Importantly, the stepper motor <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is also designed to move the arm <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> upwardly as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, to separate the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Such separation is preferrably by moving the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> upwardly out of the bath fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Such movement results in an increasingly large portion <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> of the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> being out of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. As shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>, however, as the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> moves out of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, a meniscus <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> (shown by a dash-dot-dash line) is formed between the upper fluid surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and each of the opposite planar sides <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The meniscus <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> extends upwardly from the upper surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and is in effect a localized vertically extending section of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> located above the upper surface <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The meniscus <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> terminates at a rounded nose <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). Additionally, as the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is moved upwardly and are separated from the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, a thin film, or monolayer, <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> (shown by a dash-dot-dot line), of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> forms and is retained on each side <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> above the meniscus <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. The formation of the meniscus <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, and the resulting thin film <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> retained on the sides <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, are desirable in that the thin films <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> on the planar sides <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are of uniform thickness, and promote efficient removal of the thin film <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. As a result, each portion <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> of the side <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> having the thin film <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> thereon is uniformly wet by the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> To increase the number of wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that may be processed per hour using the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and methods of the present invention, a rate of upward movement of the stepper motor <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> may be selected over a range of from one to six inches per minute. This rate of movement is selected according to the characteristics of the (a) wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that are to be carried in the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and (b) fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. More particularly, for each combination of wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, there is a maximum rate of movement of the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> out of the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at which the meniscus <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and the thin film <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> of fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> will form on each side <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. It is undesirable for the stepper motor <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to move the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> out of the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at a rate greater than this maximum rate of movement of the wafer(s) out of the bath. In detail, if this rate is exceeded, then the meniscus <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> may not form and any fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> retained on the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> exits the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may be non-uniform, such as not extending completely across the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or being non-uniform in thickness. Such non-uniform fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may evaporate non-uniformly and may leave an unacceptable level of residue and stains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Efficient removal of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> from the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is achieved by the transfer of thermal energy to the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and to the thin film <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> of fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> as the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are separated. As described above, such separation is preferably by moving the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> into and through the enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. An initial input of thermal energy to the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is from the heated fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows that after the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> exits from the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> a pump <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> directs the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> through a heater <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> that is supplied with energy by a power supply <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. The heater <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> may be an electrical resistance heater, for example, and the power supply <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> may supply 110V or 220V to the heater <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. The temperature to which the heater <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> heats the filtered fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may be adjusted based on the reading of a &ldquo;DI PROCESS TEMP&rdquo; gauge <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> on the operating panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, where &ldquo;DI&rdquo; indicates that the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may be de-ionized water.

The heater <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> heats the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> so that the temperature of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a preferred temperature, such as in the range from <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> degrees F. to 190 degrees F. More preferrably, the temperature of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is in the range from 175 degrees F. to 185 degrees F. Most preferrably, the temperature of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is in the range from 178 degrees F. to 185 degrees F. For convenience, a &ldquo;DI PROCESS TEMP LIMIT&rdquo; gauge <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is provided on the operating panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to indicate whether the temperature of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> exceeds a preferred temperature.

To complete operation <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, the next instruction (&ldquo;5&rdquo;) on the process control panel, REMOVE DRY WAFER(S), is performed. The now-dry wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are removed from the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is thus ready to be loaded with wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for the next drying operation. The method described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is thus DONE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As noted, prior to the present invention, there was a need for apparatus and methods of efficiently drying the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The efficient drying resulting from use of the present invention allows the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be separated from the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> at the described selected rate which is no less than the maximum rate at which the thin film <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and the meniscus <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> will form between the fluid bath <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the sides <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As a result, the overall period of time taken in the typical drying cycle described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> may not exceed about two minutes. To not exceed such time period, the drying cycle rapidly removes from the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> the thin films <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> that are uniformly formed on the sides <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are separated. As described above, &ldquo;rapidly&rdquo; means that such removal occurs before the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> have been separated enough to have the top of the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> hit the top panel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as the carrier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> moves upwardly in the enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In review, then, the present invention fills these needs by providing the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the described methods of efficiently removing the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> from the wafers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The efficient removing uniformly wets the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the fluid bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, so that a consistent starting condition of the wafers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is provided regardless of the type of prior processing of the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In addition, the efficient removing is attained by defining a gas-filled volume, which is provided by the hot enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that continuously transfers thermal energy to the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the volume. The wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the bath are separated at the controlled rate to form the thin films <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> of fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> on the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are positioned in the gas-filled volume defined by the enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Further, the hot gas <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> directed into the volume and across the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and out of the volume continuously transfers thermal energy to the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Since the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is not drained from the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to enable flow of the gas <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> from the enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, for example, the directing of the hot gas <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> out of the volume is not only continuous, but independent of the separation of the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. With the thin films <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> formed uniformly on the planar sides <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and with the thin films <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> provided with thermal energy as the wafers move up in the enclosure, the thermal energy transferred to the wafer(s) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the volume rapidly evaporates the thin film <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> from the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> without decreasing the rate of separation of the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> below the maximum rate of such separation at which the meniscus <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> will form between the bath <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the sides <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> during such separation. As described, such efficient removing enables the wafer throughput of such apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and method to be limited only by the type of wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that is being dried, and the type of fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> used to wet the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Thus, reliance is not placed on the thermal energy stored in a given wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to provide all of the thermal energy necessary to evaporate fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> from the wafer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Such efficient removing also involves controlling the relative humidity in the enclosure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to be low to inhibit recondensation of the fluid <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> on the wafers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the described problems with the prior art dryers are avoided. </paragraph>
