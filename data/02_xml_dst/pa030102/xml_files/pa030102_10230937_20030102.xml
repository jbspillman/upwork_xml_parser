<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the design of semiconductors, and more particularly to such design that is hierarchical in nature. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor technology pervades most electronic devices today. Computers, televisions, videocassette recorders, cameras, etc., all use semiconductor integrated circuits to varying degrees. For example, the typical computer includes microprocessors and dedicated controller integrated circuits (i.e., video controllers, audio controllers, etc.), as well as memory, such as dynamic random-access memory. The design of semiconductors, therefore, is a crucial consideration of the design of almost any electronic device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One type of semiconductor design is the design of semiconductor test structures. A semiconductor integrated circuit, for example, must be able to operate in a variety of different conditions (varying temperatures, for example), and perform within a variety of different specifications (i.e., speed, power consumption, etc.). Semiconductor test structures are therefore utilized to ensure that various components of a given semiconductor will perform according to specification in different conditions. Test structures are not integrated circuits sold to end consumers as part of an electronic device, but rather are used internally to ascertain that the end products will perform correctly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To aid in the design of semiconductors in general, and the design of semiconductor test structures in particular, software such as Design Framework II (DF2), available from Cadence Design Systems, Inc., has been developed. DF2, for example, includes an editor that permits a designer to place various components over a semiconductor substrate as necessary. DF2 also provides for a degree of flexibility in the design of such components. Specifically, DF2 includes parameterized cells, or pcells, that allow the designer to create customized instances of a pcell every time the pcell is placed on a layer. For example, a transistor can be created and have parameters assigned thereto to provide for control of its width, length, and number of gates. When instances of the transistor are placed on the layer, different values may be assigned to each of these parameters. According to the parameter values, each instance varies in size and composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The pcell approach of DF2, however, is a top-down semiconductor design approach, and thus has limitations and disadvantages associated with it. A designer may, for example, first draw a transistor, and then program that transistor to respond to parameters that will cause various parts of the design to take on those parameter values. This can be a very complex, tedious and error-prone process. For example, if the designer desires contacts to fill in the available active area space while maintaining a certain pitch and minimum separation from the active area edge, the equations to accomplish this for an arbitrarily sized active area are complex within DF2. Furthermore, these equations are specific to the transistor under development. If the designer desires to design another parameterized object&mdash;for example, a field transistor or a contact chain&mdash;he or she needs to repeat the entire process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for an approach to the designing of semiconductors that avoids the pitfalls of top-down design. The approach should enable a semiconductor designer to avoid having to &ldquo;start from scratch&rdquo; when designing a new parameterized object. Thus, the approach should be more flexible and easier to use than prior art design approaches. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned shortcomings, disadvantages and problems are addressed by the present invention, which will be understood by reading and studying the following specification. One aspect of the invention is a computerized system that includes a semiconductor structure and a basic atom. The system also includes a hierarchy of abstractions ordered from highest to lowest. Each abstraction relates a plurality of instances of an immediately lower abstraction; the highest abstraction corresponds to the structure, and the lowest abstraction corresponds to the basic atom. A plurality of sets of parameters also is included within the system, where each set of parameters corresponds to an instance of an abstraction. Changing one of the set of parameters for an instance of an abstraction changes at least one of the set of parameters for an instance of an immediately lower abstraction. Parameters desirably relate to attributes of an abstraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For example, in one embodiment, the hierarchy may have six abstractions: atoms, higher-order cells, devices, structures, and also circuits and integrated circuit chips, ordered from lowest to highest. Each of these abstractions has an associated set of parameters. Instances of atoms are used to create higher-order cells, instances of higher-order cells are used to create devices, and instances of devices are used to create structures. Each instance of an abstraction relates together a plurality of instances of an immediately lower-level abstraction. Thus, changing parameters associated with an instance of a higher-order cell, for example, automatically changes the parameters of the instances of atoms related by that higher-order cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In this manner, once appropriate atoms and higher-order cells have been designed, devices and structures can be designed easily by relating together instances of the atoms and higher-order cells. Most importantly, if the specifications governing a given structure need to be changed, a user merely has to change the parameters for the structure, which then affects the parameters of the instances of the lower level devices, higher-order cells, and atoms. That is, redesign of the structure at the atom, or even at the higher-order cell, level is not necessary. This means that semiconductor design becomes more intuitive, and enables modification of existing structures to create new structures, in a non-tedious and non-time-consuming manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes computerized systems, methods, hierarchical data structures, semiconductor structures, computer-readable media, basic atom cells, and computers of varying scope. In one embodiment of the invention, the invention is implemented in conjunction with Design Framework II (DF2) software available from Cadence Design Systems, Inc. In addition to the aspects and advantages of the present invention described in this summary, further aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent by reference to the drawings and by reading the detailed description that follows.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A description of an exemplary embodiment of the invention is provided in this section of the detailed description. The description is provided in conjunction with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) show diagrams of a representative hierarchy of a semiconductor test structure, according to an exemplary embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a flowchart of a method according to an exemplary embodiment, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a diagram of a computer in conjunction with which an exemplary embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Finally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a diagram of a semiconductor memory in conjunction with which a semiconductor test structure hierarchically designed in accordance with an embodiment of the invention may be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), a diagram of three higher-order cells, each defined by relating a number of instances of basic atom cells, is shown. Higher-order cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, defining type &ldquo;1&rdquo; higher-order cells, is defined by relating four instances of basic atom cells, atoms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Atoms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are instances of basic atom cells of type &ldquo;1&rdquo;; atom <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is an instance of basic atom cell of type &ldquo;2&rdquo;; and, atom <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is an instance of basic atom cell of type &ldquo;3&rdquo;. The type defined by higher order cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (i.e., &ldquo;1&rdquo;), and the types of atoms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (i.e., &ldquo;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and &ldquo;3&rdquo;), are for representative purposes only, and do not specifically relate to any given type of semiconductor component. Thus, the types as used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) (and as will be used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) as well) are for notational and descriptive purposes only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, each of higher order cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and atoms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> have a set of parameters related to its type. For example, the parameters may be related to placement, size, etc. (i.e., different attributes of the given cell). Desirably, higher order cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has parameters that when changed also change the parameters of atoms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as necessary. Thus, higher order cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> relates atoms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to one another. Changing a parameter in cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that causes that cell to become larger, for example, causes corresponding changes in atoms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that make up that instance of cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), two other higher-order cells are defined, cells <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is made up of atoms <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Atoms <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are of type &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and atom <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is of type &ldquo;3&rdquo;; cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> itself defines type &ldquo;2&rdquo; for higher-order cells. Similarly, cell <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is made up of atoms <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, where atoms <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are of type &ldquo;2&rdquo;, atom <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is of type &ldquo;3&rdquo;, and atoms <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are of type &ldquo;3&rdquo;. Cell <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> itself defines type &ldquo;3&rdquo; for high-order cells. As with cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and its constituent atoms, cells <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and their constituent atoms each has a set of parameters related to its type. Desirably, when a parameter of either cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> changes, one or more parameters of one or more of the associated constituent atoms also change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The basic hierarchical structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a powerful tool for the design of semiconductor test structures. For example, once higher-order cells <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> have been defined as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), they may be utilized to create more complex devices and structures, without forcing the designer to concern him or herself over details regarding the individual constituent atoms of the higher-order cells. For example, the designer may wish to design a transistor. Atoms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be the two basic atoms necessary in such a design; each exists independently and has significant programming therein. Cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, then, may be a higher-level structure, where parameters from atoms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are inherited up to cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A cell called tran, for transistor, is then created by placing an instance of cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and setting the parameters of cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> such that a transistor is formed&mdash;the cell tran can then be used by anyone by setting its parameters. Transistors of different sizes and shapes can be created. </paragraph>

Device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, defining type &ldquo;1&rdquo; devices, is defined by relating three instances of higher-order cells, cells <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Cells <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are instances of cells of type &ldquo;1,&rdquo; as has been defined as cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>); cell <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is an instance of cells of type &ldquo;3,&rdquo; as has been defined as cell <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). As with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the type defined by device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is for representative purposes only, and does not specifically relate to any given type of semiconductor component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Each of device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and cells <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has a set of parameters related to its type. Desirably, device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> has parameters that when changed also change the parameters of cells <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, which in turn change the parameters of the atoms making up these cells (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). That is, changing a parameter for device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> may change a parameter for cell <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, which as a type &ldquo;3&rdquo; higher-order cell has six constituent atoms, as has been shown in and described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Thus, the changing of the parameter for cell <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> instigated by changing a parameter for device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> also may change one or more parameters of one or more of these six constituent atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), one other device is defined, device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is made up of two instances of higher-order cells, cells <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Cell <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is of type &ldquo;2,&rdquo; as has been defined as cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), and cell <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is of type &ldquo;3,&rdquo; as has been defined as cell <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> itself defines type &ldquo;2&rdquo; for devices. As with device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and its constituent higher-order cells, device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and its constituent higher-order cells each has a set of parameters related to its type. Desirably, when a parameter of device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> changes, one or more parameters of one or more of its constituent cells changes as well, propagating a change of one or more parameters of one or more of the atoms making up these constituent cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the basic hierarchical structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is expanded by the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), two devices are defined. A designer of a semiconductor test structure may therefore utilize these devices within the test structure, such that the designer does not need to concern him or herself with the actual cells making up these devices, or the constituent atoms making up the higher-cells. The devices may thus be viewed as a higher abstraction than the higher-order cells, just as the higher-order cells are a higher abstraction than the basic atom cells. Changing the parameter of a device, for instance, may cause many changes in the parameters of the basic atom cells. Without the invention, there would be no lower cells at all; all the programming would be done at the highest level. By comparison, under the invention, the designer only needs to change the parameter of a device, and if the device and its higher-order cells are defined correctly, appropriate changes are propagated through to and made within the basic atom cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The hierarchical structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and extended in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) may be additionally extended as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), which is a diagram of a semiconductor test structure, defined by relating three instances of the devices that have been defined in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Semiconductor test structure <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is defined by relating two instances of devices of type &ldquo;1,&rdquo; devices <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, as devices of type &ldquo;1&rdquo; have been defined as device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and one instance of devices of type &ldquo;2,&rdquo; device <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, as devices of type &ldquo;2&rdquo; have been defined as device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The semiconductor test structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is for representative purposes only, and does not specifically relate to any given type of semiconductor structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Each of structure <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and devices <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> has a set of parameters related to its type. Desirably, structure <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> has parameters that when changed also change the parameters of devices <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, which in turn change the parameters of the higher-order cells making up these devices (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>)), which in turn change the parameters of the atoms making up these cells (also not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>)). That is, changing a parameter for structure <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> may change a parameter for device <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which as a type &ldquo;2&rdquo; device has two constituent higher-order cells, as has been shown in and described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Further, this change in a parameter for device <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may cause a change in one of the parameters of one of the two constituent higher-order cells, which may then cause a change in one of the parameters of one of the basic atom cells of this higher-order cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Thus, the semiconductor test structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) (as based on the structures of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)) may be viewed as being represented by a hierarchical data structure having four layers of abstraction: a highest layer of abstraction, the test structure itself; a second highest layer of abstraction, the devices making up the test structure; a third highest layer of abstraction, the higher-order cells making up the devices; and a lowest level of abstraction, the basic atom cells making up the higher-order cells. Changing the parameters of any one layer of abstraction causes the changing of the parameters of an immediately lower layer of abstraction, which then propagates changes down to the lowest level of abstraction. The FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) may also be viewed as a computerized system, such that changing one aspect (parameter) of the system during the design of a test structure causes lower aspects of the system to automatically change. Note that other layers of abstraction can be formed on top of the four shown in and described in conjunction with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), such as circuits and integrated circuit chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The hierarchical design of semiconductor test structures as has been shown in and described in conjunction with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) provides for advantages not found in the prior art. By abstracting each layer within a semiconductor test structure, for example, different users can be responsible for different parts of the design, without having to be skilled in all aspects of the structure&apos;s design. For instance, one designer may be responsible for designing a library of basic atom cells, or a single very flexible basic atom cells. Another designer may be responsible for designing a library of higher-order cells based on the basic atom cell or cells. Still another designer may be responsible for designing devices based on the higher-order cells. A designer who is responsible for designing the structure itself can piece together a structure based on the devices and higher-order cells that have already been created. Finally, an end user may use this structure to create different instances thereof by simply changing the parameters of the structure in accordance with current specifications. This is advantageous, because this user does not have to be skilled in manipulation of the basic atom cells, since changing the parameters thereof will be accomplished automatically by changing parameters of the structure itself. Another advantage of the invention is that the cell designer can build in optimal design characteristics into the cell structure, and be guaranteed that those characteristics are retained in a specific instance of the cell placement by a cell user who may not be fully aware of the optimal design characteristics. In this way, the cells can incorporate and pass on a high level of design experience and avoid the possibility of design errors caused by inexperienced designers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A hierarchical semiconductor test structure design according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention has been shown and described. Those of ordinary skill within the art will appreciate that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiment shown in and described in conjunction with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), however. For instance, there may be many more higher-order cells than the three defined in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), each of which may have many more constituent basic atom cells than the number shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). For further instance, there may be many more devices than the two defined in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), each of which also may have many more constituent higher-order cells than the number shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Finally, the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) may have many more constituent devices than the number shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flowchart of a method according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention is shown. The method may be implemented as a computerized method executed as a computer program on a suitably equipped computer (in particular, executed by a processor of the computer from a computer-readable medium of the computer, such as a memory). Such a computer program may be stored on a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk, a compact-disc read-only-memory (CD-ROM), or a memory such as a random-access memory (RAM) or a read-only memory (ROM). The invention is not so limited. The method may be also be utilized to create a semiconductor test structure in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a basic atom cell is created. This basic cell may be such as those described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The basic atom cell has at least one parameter that affects attributes thereof. The basic atom cell is the lowest abstraction within the hierarchical data structure for the semiconductor test structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, higher-order cells, such as those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), are created. Each higher-order cell relates a plurality of instances of the basic atom cell. Desirably, higher-order cells also have parameters that affect attributes thereof. These parameters are such that when one of the parameters changes, one or more of the parameters of one or more of the plurality of instances of the basic atom cell related by the higher-order cell also change. In this way, the higher-order cells are a higher abstraction than the basic atom cell, and enable a designer to work with higher-order cells without having to specifically work with basic atom cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, devices, such as those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), are created. Each device relates a plurality of instances of higher-order cells. Desirably, devices also have parameters that affect attributes thereof. These parameters are also such that when one of the parameters changes, one or more of the parameters of the one or more of the plurality of instances of the higher-order cells also change (and thus instigating change to basic atom cells as well). The devices are a higher abstraction than the higher-order cells, permitting a designer to work with devices without having to specifically work with higher-order cells or basic atom cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Finally, in step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a test structure, such as that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), is created. A test structure relates a plurality of instances of devices. Desirably, test structures also have parameters that affect attributes thereof. These parameters are such that when one of them changes, one or more of the parameters of the one or more of the plurality of instances of the devices also change (and thus instigating change to higher-order cells and basic atom cells as well). The structures are the highest abstraction, and permit a designer to work with a test structure without having to specifically work with devices, higher-order cells, or basic atom cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> thus provides for the design of a semiconductor test structure in a hierarchical manner. Each of the basic cells of step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be used in a number of different higher-order cells, which may be used in a number of different devices, which may be used in a number of different test structures. The hierarchical approach permits specialization as well: a designer may specifically only be skilled at creating one of the levels of abstraction, saving his or her work in a library such that the designer constructing the next layer of abstraction is able to utilize the immediately lower layer without having particular skill in construction of such lower layers. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Contacts <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> have thirteen associated parameters, cx <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, cy <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, cont <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, cpx <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, cpy <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, cmx <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>, cmy <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, nx <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>, ny <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight>, ax <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight>, ay <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>, cofx <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> and cofy <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>. Cx <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> and cy <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> are x and y values, respectively, that control the size of the layer of contact <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. Cont <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> specifies the type of the base layer for contacts <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. An &ldquo;N&rdquo; type for cont <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> turns off this layer within cell <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Cpx <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> and cpy <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> are x and y values, respectively, that specify the pitch of the contacts within the base layer. Cmx <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight> and cmy <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> are x and y values, respectively, that specify the minimum allowed distance of the contact block to the base layer edge provided within contacts <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Nx <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> and ny <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> are x and y values, respectively, that specify the number of contacts within the allowed area of the base layer provided by cont <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. The allowed area is the region of the base layer that is defined by (lx minus two times cmx) and (ly minus two times cmy) in dimension. A value of nx and ny of 0.0 fills up zero percent of the allowed area in the base layer with contacts (i.e., no contacts). A value of 1.0 for nx and ny fills 100% of the allowed area in the base layer with contacts. A negative number for nx and ny forces the absolute value of that number of contacts to be placed. For example, an nx value of negative three and an ny value of negative five creates a contact block of three by five contacts independent of the allowed region of the base layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Ax <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> and ay <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> are x and y values, respectively, that align the contact block within the allowed region of the base layer. An ax value of negative one pushes the contact block to the extreme left of the allowed region. An ax value of one pushes the contact block to the extreme right of the allowed region. An ax value of zero centers the contact block within the allowed based region. Similar behavior applies to ay <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>. Fractional values between negative one and positive one accords proportional behavior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> While ax <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> and ay <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> produce shifts in the contact block relative to the base layer, cofx <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> and cofy <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> are x and y values, respectively, that produce absolute shifts in addition to those produced by ax <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>. For example, if contacts are to be 0.1 micron off center in the x direction and centered exactly in the y direction, the parameters are to be set as follows: ax as zero, cofx as 0.1, ay as zero, and cofy as 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Thus, nx and ny calculate the size of the contact array, and ax and ay align that array over the base layer. If nx and ny are negative, then the absolute value of that number is the number of contacts; for example, if nx is minus eight and ny is minus five, then an eight by five array of contacts is aligned over the allowable base layer. If nx and ny are positive, then it can take values from zero through one. If nx is one, for example, then 100% of the allowable area is filled with contacts in the x direction. If nx is 0.5, then 50% of the allowable area is filled within contacts in the x direction. (The allowable area is lx minus two times cmx and ly minus two times cmy.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Once nx and ny have been used to determine the size of the contact array, ax <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> and ay <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> are used to align that array over the allowable area. If ax is one, then the contacts are pushed to the extreme right of the allowable area. If ax is zero, then the contacts are centered in the allowable area. If ax is minus one, then the contacts are pushed to the extreme left of the allowable area. Ay <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight> behaves similarly in the y direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Ax and ay shift contacts based upon a percentage of the available space. The contact offset parameters, cofx <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> and cofy <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>, allow the contacts to be shifted by a fixed amount from the default positions given by ax <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> and ay <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>. For example, if contacts are to be shifted 0.1 micron to the right of center, ax is set to zero and cofx is set to 0.1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Metal caps <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> has five associated parameters, cap <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>, csx <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>, csy <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight>, csofx <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, and csofy <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. Cap <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> specifies the type of the cap layer provided by metal caps <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. A value of &ldquo;N&rdquo; turns off the cap layer. Csx <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight> and csy <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> are x and y values, respectively, that specify the surround of caps <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> with respect to contacts <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. Values of zero for csofx and csofy center the caps about the contacts. Any other values cause offsets of the cap layer by the specified amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Finally, metal pad <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> has eight associated parameters, pad <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, psx <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight>, psy <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight>, padrel <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>, apx <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight>, apy <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>, psofx <highlight><bold>566</bold></highlight> and psofy <highlight><bold>568</bold></highlight>. Pad <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> specifies the layer type of the pad layer provided by pad <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. A value of &ldquo;N&rdquo; turns off the pad layer. Psx <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> and psy <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight> are x and y values, respectively, that control the size of the pad layer that globally surrounds the contact block. The effect of psy and psx depends on the setting of padrel <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Padrel <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> is a boolean parameter determining the effect of psx <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> and psy <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight>. If padrel is set to &ldquo;Y,&rdquo; then the pad layer covers the contact block by values of (csx plus psy) and (csy plus psy) in the x and y directions, respectively (that is, the pad is placed relative to the contact block). If padrel is set to &ldquo;N,&rdquo; then the size of the pad is provided by psx and psy independent of the size of the contact block and other parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Apx <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> and apy <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> are x and y values, respectively, that align the pad with respect to the contact block, and behaves in a similar fashion to ax <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> and ay <highlight><bold>536</bold></highlight> that have already been described. Psofx <highlight><bold>566</bold></highlight> and psofy <highlight><bold>568</bold></highlight> are x and y values, respectively, that offset the pads by the given amount from the alignment that results from the values of psx, psy, apx, apy, and padrel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As has been described, C1 cell <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is a parameterized cell that has four layers: underlayer geometry (or base layer) <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, contacts layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, metal caps layer <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, and metal pad layer <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. The variables (parameters) within the C1 cell allow any size rectangular base layer to be created. Contacts of any size can be put into this base layer. Caps can be placed over these contacts with any cap overlap contact dimension in the x and y direction. The number of contacts that are placed within the base layer can be specified directly (e.g., nx as minus eight, ny as minus thirteen), or can be input as a percentage of the allowable area that can hold contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> This allowable area is determined by subtracting two times cmx and two times cmy from the x and y dimensions of the base layer, respectively. For example, if lx and ly are 100 and 100 (specifying size of the base layer), and cmx and cmy are 20 and 30, then the allowable area for contacts is 60 in the x direction and 40 in the y direction. Contacts fill up this area based upon the contact size and contact pitch that is specified. Once the number of allowable contacts are placed, then the contacts can be shifted as a group anywhere within the allowable area. The caps over the contacts, and the metal pads, are completely programmable in terms of size as well as offsets in the x and the y directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The layer parameters, layer <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, cont <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, cap <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>, and pad <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, are used to determine the layers that are used in cell <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. For example, the base layer specified by layer <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> can be changed to an allowable layer. If an &ldquo;N&rdquo; is input in either layer, cont, cap or pad, then those layers will not be placed. That is, if cap or cont is &ldquo;N&rdquo; then no contact or cap layer will be present regardless of the values any variables related to those layers may have. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The basic atom cell described and shown as cell <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is termed a C1 cell. It is the most general cell, allowing full control in the x and y directions of cont, cap and pad. The contacts align to the base layer, the caps align to the contacts, and the pad aligns to the contacts. Other basic atom cells derived from the C1 cell are also desirable, to allow for easier creation of higher order-cells, and subsequently devices and structures. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a table of such other basic atom cells (table <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>) according to one embodiment of the invention. Each of these other basic atom cells are derived from the C1 cell, or from another cell within the table. Those of ordinary skill within the art can appreciate that the invention can be used to design other different types of basic cells with specialized properties and features that can be used to create higher-order complex objects with a minimum of programming effort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> diagram of a master cell for use in accordance with one embodiment of the invention is shown. Master cell <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is completely programmable to produce any desired subcell by easily eliminating undesired basic atom cells from master cell <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, master cell <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes nine C1 cells, such as C1 cell <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, nine l1 cells, such as l1 cell <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, and nine c1a cells, such as c1a cell <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. Associated with the cells, as known to those of ordinary skill in the art of DF2 software, are a number of horizontal and vertical stretch lines, such as stretch lines <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, which adjust the positioning of cells such as <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. Using a master cell provides for quicker generation of higher-order cells, devices and structures because it is generally much quicker to delete elements from the master cell than it is to create them from a blank slate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The parameters of the basic atom cells provide great flexibility in producing a base layer with contacts, caps, and pad. Any orthogonal parametric structure should be able to be decomposed into an array of C1 cells, for instance, with different relative orientations to one another. For example, a two-terminal resistor can be thought of as a C1 cell on the left with layer, contacts, and pad turned on and caps off; a C1 cell in the middle with contacts, cap, and pad turned off; and a C1 cell on the right with layer, contacts, pad turned on and caps turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> This two-terminal resistor can be viewed as including three C1 cells with cell 2 oriented to cell 1 and cell 3 oriented to cell 2. This is referred to as a c3<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>2 structure. It may be an end test structure in and of itself, or it may be a higher-order cell structure for use in other more complex devices and structures. Another type of test structure may be built from three C1 cells where both cell 2 and cell 3 align to cell 1. This is referred to as a c3<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1 structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A VanDerPauw resistor, known within the art, can be built from a c9<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>2225678: cell 1 forms the body of the resistor, cells 2, 3, 4 and 5 form the arms that align to cell 1, and cells 6, 7, 8, and 9 form the pads on the arms that align to cells 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows such a c9<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>2225678 higher-order cell, cell <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows such a c9<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>2225678 cell after it has been converted into a VanDerPauw resistor, resistor <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. Higher-order cells such as c9<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>2225678 may be referred to as elements, and can themselves by manipulated into a vast array of parametric devices and structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A set of parameters referred to as shift parameters are used in higher-order cells, devices and structures to determine the relative orientation of the lower-level abstractions, such as C1 cells, with respect to one another. For example, one set of shift parameters may be shift 32x, a32x, o32x (with a similar set existing for y directions). With these parameters, the alignment of cell 3 with respect to cell 2 can be controlled. For example, setting shift 32x to 2, a32x to 0, and o32x to 0 centers cell 3 with respect to cell 2. Setting o32x to 0.1 offsets cell 3 by 0.1 micron from the center of cell 2. The a parameters take on values from minus one to plus one, and behave similar to the ax and ay parameters that shift the contacts within the C1 cell itself; i.e., it produces a relative shift about an axis. The shift 32x parameter determines the axis about which shifting occurs. For example, shift 32x set to one shifts cell 3 about the left edge of cell 2; shift 32x set to two shifts cell 3 about the center of cell 2, etc. The o32x parameter provides offsets from the shift and a parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Thus, a collection of higher-order cells (or elements) may be created to assist in development of even higher levels of abstractions, such as structures and devices. The invention is not particularly limited to any set of higher-order cells. However, a table of higher-order cells according to one embodiment of the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Within <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, table <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> includes two columns: column <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, which lists the higher-order cells, and column <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, which lists the basic atom cells that constitute these higher-order cells, and/or a description of the higher-order cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The creation of such higher-order cells is accomplished by relating together two or more basic atom cells, and attaching appropriate parameters thereto. For example, the c2 cell includes two C1 cells. Each C1 cell has its own set of parameters such as 11x, 12x, 11y, 12y, etc. In addition, there are a set of parameters that determine how the second C1 cell is aligned to the first. That is, the combination of the set of parameters determines how the second C1 cell is aligned to the first C1 cell in the x and y directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Specifically, there are six parameters: shift 21x, shift 21y, a21x, a21y, o21x, and o21y. Shift 21x determines the type of shift that layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> does with respect to layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the x direction. Shift 21y determines the type of shift that layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> does with respect to layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the y direction. A21x determines the percentage amount of shift in the x direction, while a21y determines the percentage amount of shift in the y direction. O21x determines the absolute shift in the x direction after a21x has been applied, while o21y determines the absolute shift in the y direction after a21y has been applied. The a21x and a21y parameters have possible values ranging from minus one to plus one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> For further example, a c3 cell has three C1 cells that align to one another. Cell 2 aligns only to cell 1 but cell 3 aligns to either cell 1 or to cell 2. Thus, there are two types of c3 cells: c3<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1 and c3<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>2. C3<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1 has cell 3 aligning to cell 1 and c3<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>2 has cell 3 aligning to cell 2. The c1 and c2 cells require no extensions. The c3 cell has local parameters such as 11x, 12x and 13x, and also global parameters to determine the relative shifts of the c1, c3 and c3 cells. Thus, in c3<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>2 there are parameters shift 32x, shift 32y, a32x, a32y, o32x. o32y, shift 21x, shift 21y, a21x, a21y, o21x and o21y. In c3<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1 there are the parameters shift 31x, shift 31y, a31x, a31y, o31x, o31y, shift 21x, shift 21y, a21x, a21y, o21x and o21y. As a final example, a c4 cell has four C1 cells that align to one another. There are four variations, namely c4<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>11, c4<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>12, c4<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>22 and c4<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>23. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Once a core library of higher-order cell has been created, as has been shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> library of devices and structures can then also be created. All devices and structures eventually lead back to basic atom cells. A table of exemplary devices and structures, and their descriptions, according to one embodiment of the invention is shown as table <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Devices are desirably built up from higher-order cells, and structures are desirably built up from devices. Further layers of abstraction are also possible, such as modules, built up from structures, and integrated circuit chips, built up from modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Thus, once structures have been created, higher levels of abstraction, such as the module, can also be created. A module has programmable pads, with structures in-between the pads. The size of the structures and their orientation are connected to the location, size and orientation of the interconnection pads. Higher level parameters may be used to configure the entire module, controlling all aspects of the module from pad size and pitch to inner-structure details such as transistor nibble, gate length, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A description of a specific embodiment of the invention, for implementation in conjunction with DF2 software, has been described. Those of ordinary skill within the art will appreciate that while the invention has been described in relation to DF2 software, the invention is not so limited. Thus, an embodiment of the invention utilizing other software, or programmed from scratch, is within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
