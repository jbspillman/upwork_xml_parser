<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A tilt angle sensor is disclosed that is capable of detecting whether a tilt angle of a reference plane exceeds a predetermined value by means of only one threshold value. Although only one threshold value is used, the tilt angle can be measured with respect to either a clockwise or a counterclockwise direction from the untilted state. A pair of differential electrodes electrically independent of each other are formed in a shape symmetric with respect to upper and lower sections of a printed circuit board. A common electrode plate is mounted opposed to the pair of differential electrodes with a predetermined gap therebetween. The pair of differential electrodes and the common electrode is stored in a closed space formed by the printed circuit board and an oil case. A dielectric liquid is filled into the closed space in such a way that the level of the liquid varies according to the tilt of the reference plane. An output signal corresponding to the difference in capacity between two capacitors formed by associated components is produced as a tilt detection output. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electrostatic type tilt sensor which is used for detecting a tilt angle with respect to a plane perpendicular to the direction of gravity, more particularly to a tilt sensor providing an alarm or conducting a predetermined control when a detected tilt angle exceeds a predetermined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventional tilt sensors employing a tilt detection element are described in Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. 4-53528 and Japanese Examined Utility Model Publication No. 5-14168. An electrostatic type tilt sensor having these types of conventional structure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an exploded view of a conventional tilt sensor. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a conventional tilt sensor along a plane cut normal to a front surface of the tilt detection element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made of a heat resistant material, for example a laminate plate made of glass cloth and epoxy resin, is disposed vertically with respect to a reference plane for measuring a tilt angle when a tilt sensor is fixed to an object whose tilt angle is to be measured. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, this reference plane is designated by the plane including an imaginary line L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> represented by a double-dotted and dashed line. This plane defined by the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> becomes a reference plane from which to measure tilt angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The reference plane is in a &ldquo;0 degree&rdquo; tilt angle when the reference plane includes a line normal to the direction of gravity. In the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a pair of differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed of a copper foil pattern electrically independent of each other in two regions. The two regions (left and right) are defined by a plane formed along the intersection of (an imaginary line L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown by a double dot and dash line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) both the reference plane and the surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The signal processing circuit section of the tilt sensor, which includes a printed wiring pattern and related electronic parts will be described hereinafter. The signal processing circuit section is mounted on a surface opposite to the surface on which the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are formed. The respective differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to the copper foil pattern on the surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The signal processing circuit section is formed via through holes, at the electrode points <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The pair of differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed as an electrode pattern which is symmetric with respect to the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, each electrode of the pair of differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed as an electrode pattern which is symmetric with respect to the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Imaginary line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the line that is normal to the imaginary L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, each of the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is shaped like a horizontal fan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the arc-shaped periphery of each of the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>follows the shape a circular arc. The circular arc is defined by a circle with its center at the point of intersection of the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this example, the diameter of the circle is set at 30 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A reference numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> designates a common electrode plate formed of a conductive material having a desired rigidity. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, this common electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is mounted on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a state where it is held in parallel to the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with a certain gap between them. A plurality of terminals <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are inserted into the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which are integral with the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and are formed by bending the plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at right angles. The terminals <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are inserted into terminal holes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>made in the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and are secured by soldering them to the surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on which the signal processing circuit section is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An oil case <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed of plastics having a desired flexibility is formed in the shape of a letter U in cross section. When an end face of the oil case <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is bonded to the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with bonding means such as a double-faced adhesive tape <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B or the like, the oil case <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> forms a closed space with the surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The peripheries of the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the periphery of the common electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the periphery of the case <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed concentrically with each other. The opposite faces of the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, that of the common electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the corresponding face of the case <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are formed in parallel to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The closed space formed by the case <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is filled with a dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> such as a silicone oil or the like. The dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is poured from a through hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> made in the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the level of approximately half the effective volume in the closed space, e.g. to the level of the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The through hole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is filled with the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and is then sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An electrostatic shielding plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is mounted on a side of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to cover the case <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and its surroundings and the electrostatic shielding plate <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is mounted on a second side of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to cover the signal processing circuit section described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a schematic view of a signal processing circuit section of an exemplary, conventional tilt sensor. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an oscillator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the output terminal thereof are connected to the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the tilt detection element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the characteristics described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Further, the pair of differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the tilt detection element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are connected to the input terminals of capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The output terminals of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to the input terminals of a differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, respectively. An output terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the tilt sensor is led out of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The signal processing circuit section is provided with a power stabilizing circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the stabilized voltage supplied from this power stabilizing circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is supplied to the oscillator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a power supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Since the signal processing circuit section is arranged in the manner described hereinabove, an oscillation output signal of a predetermined frequency from the oscillator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is supplied to the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through a first capacitor connected by the differential electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and also to the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through a second capacitor connected by the differential electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, peak value signals corresponding to the capacity of the first capacitor and the capacity of the second capacitor are applied to the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>rectify the input signals, and produce smoothed voltage. Therefore, the respective output voltages of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>correspond to peak values of the input signals. The capacity of the first capacitor and the capacity of the second capacitor correspond to their respective input signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> produces a differential voltage between the output voltage of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the output voltage of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as the output of the tilt sensor at the output terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In summary, the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> produces an output voltage corresponding to the difference in capacity between the first capacitor and the second capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The tilt sensor, provided with the tilt detection element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the signal processing circuit section, is mounted on a plane to be measured, e.g. the reference plane for measuring the tilt of the object to be measured as described above. The tilt sensor is placed such that the surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the tilt detection element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes the plane to be measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When a plane to be measured is not tilted in the tilt direction that is desired to be measured, a differential voltage of zero is obtained. The plane to be measured includes a line normal to the direction of gravity and essentially remains unchanged. Under this condition, the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is brought into a state where approximately half of the respective differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are immersed dipped in the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the capacity of the first capacitor associated with the differential electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are equal to the capacity of the second capacitor associated with the differential electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the difference in output voltage between the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>becomes zero. The output voltage of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> becomes a corresponding voltage Vo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When the plane to be measured is tilted in the tilt direction to be measured, the liquid levels of the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will change. The liquid level of the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is brought into a state where one of the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is immersed in the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in proportion to the tilt angle experienced by the plane being measured (e.g., surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the opposite differential electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is no longer exposed to the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in proportion to the tilt angle experienced by the plane being measured. A difference in capacity is produced by this effect corresponding to (and representative of) the tilt angle between the first capacitor and the second capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when the plane to be measured is tilted in the &plus;&thgr; direction (for example, counterclockwise) from the position where the tilt angle is 0 degree, the capacity of the first capacitor is decreased and the capacity of the second capacitor is increased. Therefore, the output voltage of the capacity-voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>becomes larger than that of the capacity-voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the output voltage of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is made larger than the voltage Vo by the amount corresponding to the tilt angle in the &plus;&thgr; direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the plane to be measured is tilted in the &minus;&thgr; direction (for example, clockwise) from the position where the tilt angle is 0 degree, the capacity of the second capacitor is decreased and the capacity of the first capacitor is increased and hence the output voltage of the capacity-voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>becomes smaller than that of the capacity-voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the output voltage of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is made smaller than the voltage Vo by the amount corresponding to the tilt angle in the &minus;&thgr; direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> produces the voltage corresponding to the difference in the output voltage between the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, or the difference in capacity between the two capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a graphical view showing output voltage characteristics of a conventional tilt sensor. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the output voltage of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a direct current varying linearly in proportion to the tilt angle of the plane to be measured from the position where the plane to be measured at tilt angle &equals;&thgr;, wherein the tilt angle includes the tilt direction from the position where the plane to be measured at tilt angle &equals;&thgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In aforementioned structure, the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are shaped like the fan described above so that the output voltage of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> corresponds linearly to a change in the tilt angle, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The measurement of tilt angle through this type of conventional tilt sensor is often used to provide an alarm indicating that the plane to be measured is tilted more than a predetermined value. A threshold voltage is set for the output voltage of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. An alarm is issued when the output voltage exceeds the threshold voltage. Here, since the output voltage characteristics of a conventional tilt sensor vary linearly with respect to the tilt angle, threshold voltages are set for each tilt angle direction, e.g. a threshold voltage V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponding to a threshold tilt angle for tilt angles in the &plus;&thgr; direction and a threshold voltage V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponding to a threshold tilt angle for tilt angles in the &minus;&thgr; direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An alarm circuit includes a first detection circuit for issuing an alarm when the output voltage of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is larger than the voltage V<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the plane to be measured is tilted in the &plus;&thgr; direction and at a second detection circuit for issuing an alarm when the output voltage of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is smaller than the voltage V<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when the plane to be measured is tilted in the &minus;&thgr; direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> However, in the aforementioned arrangements using a conventional tilt sensor, the alarm circuit is necessarily complex. Since the alarm circuit is required to set different threshold voltages and to have different detection circuits for both tilt directions (&plus;&thgr; and &minus;&thgr;) from the position where the plane to be measured is at the tilt angle of 0 degrees. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the shortcomings associated with the related art and achieves other advantages not realized by the related art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An aspect of the present invention is to provide a tilt sensor capable of detecting variations in tilt angle for use in an alarm circuit utilizing only one threshold value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> An aspect of the present invention is to provide an alarm circuit having a tilt sensor that utilizes one threshold value for tilt angle that is indicative of tilt angle, irrespective of the direction of tilt of the plane to be measured from the 0 degree or no-tilt position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> These and other aspects are accomplished by a tilt sensor comprising a printed circuit board disposed in a direction normal to a reference plane for measuring a tilt angle; a pair of differential electrodes mounted on the printed circuit board; a common electrode plate opposed to the pair of differential electrodes with a predetermined gap formed between the differential electrodes; a common electrode fixed to the printed circuit board by a terminal formed from the common electrode plate; a dielectric liquid filled into a closed space in a state where its surface level varies according to the tilt angle of the reference plane; a signal processing circuit section formed on the printed circuit board, the signal processing circuit section producing an output signal corresponding to a difference in capacity between two capacitors, each capacitor includes the common electrode and a respective differential electrode of the pair of differential electrodes, as a tilt angle detection output, wherein the pair of differential electrodes are mounted electrically independently of each other in upper and lower regions respectively, wherein the upper and lower regions are divided by a horizontal centerline, the horizontal centerline passing through a center of gravity of the printed circuit board in a direction normal to a direction of gravity when the printed circuit board is in a &ldquo;no tilt&rdquo; condition, and the pair of differential electrodes are formed in shapes symmetrical to said horizontal centerline and a vertical centerline of the printed circuit board, the vertical centerline passing through said center of gravity and normal to the horizontal centerline; and an oil case for storing the pair of differential electrodes and the common electrode plate and forming the closed space between itself and the printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> These and other aspects are accomplished by a tilt sensor comprising a printed circuit board disposed in a direction normal to a reference plane for measuring a tilt; a pair of differential electrodes mounted on the printed circuit board, which are electrically independent of each other; a common electrode plate opposed to the pair of differential electrodes with a predetermined gap therebetween; a common electrode fixed to the printed circuit board by a terminal formed of the common electrode plate; a case body for storing the pair of differential electrodes and the common electrode plate in the closed space formed by itself and the printed circuit board; a dielectric liquid filled into the closed space in the state where its surface level varies according to the tilt of the reference plane; and a signal processing circuit section which is formed on the printed circuit board and is capable of producing the output signal of the level corresponding to the difference in capacity between two capacitors, each of which is constituted of the common electrode and each of the pair of the differential electrodes, as a tilt detection output, wherein the pair of differential electrodes are mounted electrically independently of each other in the regions which are divided by a first intersection where a plane parallel to the reference plane intersects the printed circuit board, and are formed in a shape symmetric with respect to the first intersection, and each of the pair of differential electrodes is formed in a shape symmetric with respect to a second intersection where a plane normal to the reference plane intersects the printed circuit board; wherein the dielectric liquid is filled into the closed space to the level of the first intersection; and wherein the signal processing circuit section includes: a buffer circuit for receiving a signal of a predetermined frequency from the outside and supplying it to the common electrode; a first capacity-voltage conversion circuit for rectifying a signal taken out of a first capacitor constituted by the common electrode and one electrode of the pair of differential electrodes and converting it into voltage; a second capacity-voltage conversion circuit for rectifying a signal taken out of a second capacitor constituted by the common electrode and the other electrode of the pair of differential electrodes and converting it into voltage; and a differential amplifier circuit for producing the difference between the output voltage of the first capacity-voltage conversion circuit and that of the second capacity-voltage conversion circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When a tilt sensor according to the present invention is mounted on a reference plane for measuring a tilt angle, e.g. the surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes a the plane to be measured, the output signal of the signal processing circuit section has the following varying characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the zero degree, or &ldquo;no tilt&rdquo; condition, the plane to be measured is not tilted in the tilt direction to be measured and only one of the pair of differential electrodes is dipped in the dielectric liquid and the output signal of the signal processing circuit section becomes a predetermined value Vn. The predetermined value Vn corresponds to the difference in capacity between the two capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When the plane to be measured is tilted in either tilt direction to be measured, the output signal of the signal processing circuit section becomes approximately the predetermined value Vn described above in the range of the tilt angle where the level of the dielectric liquid does not reach the other electrode of the pair of differential electrodes. Where the plane to be measured is tilted in either the &plus;&thgr; or &minus;&thgr; tilt directions, as described above, the predetermined value Vn is approximately obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the plane to be measured is further tilted in either tilt direction, and the level of the dielectric liquid reaches the other differential electrode of the pair of differential electrodes, variations in capacity corresponding to either differential electrode are obtained. In either of the cases where the plane to be measured is tilted in the &plus;&thgr; or &minus;&thgr; directions, a part of one differential electrode will be removed from the dielectric liquid by some degree and a part of the other differential electrode will become immersed in the dielectric liquid by a corresponding amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In this state, the capacity of the capacitor which has been dipped in the dielectric liquid is decreased (formed of one differential electrode and the common electrode), while the capacity of the capacitor which is dipped in the dielectric liquid is increased (formed of the other differential electrode and the common electrode). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the difference in capacity between the two capacitors is decreased and hence the level of the output signal from the signal processing circuit section is decreased relative to the tilt angle. Here, the output signal varies in the same way in either of the cases where the plane to be measured is tilted in the either the &plus;&thgr; or rection, &thgr; tilt direction, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the present invention, the number of threshold values required for detecting a tilt angle larger than a predetermined tilt angle is reduced to one threshold value used for either tilt direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an exploded view of a tilt sensor according to an embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the tilt detection element of the tilt sensor taken along a plane cut normal to a front plane <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic view of a signal processing circuit section of a tilt sensor according to an embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graphical view showing output voltage characteristics of a tilt sensor according to an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of a heat resistant material, for example, a laminate made of glass cloth and epoxy resin, is disposed vertically with respect to a reference plane for measuring a tilt angle when a tilt sensor is fixed to an object whose tilt angle is to be measured. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the reference plane is designated by a plane including an imaginary line L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> shown by a double-dotted and dashed line. This reference plane becomes a plane to be measured. This plane defined by the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> becomes a reference plane from which to measure tilt angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The reference plane is in a &ldquo;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> degree&rdquo; tilt angle when the reference plane includes a line normal to the direction of gravity. In the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a pair of differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed of a copper foil pattern electrically independent of each other in two regions. The two regions (upper and lower) are defined by a plane formed along the intersection of (an imaginary line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown by a double-dotted and dashed-line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) both the reference plane and the surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The signal processing circuit section of the tilt sensor, which includes a printed wiring pattern and associated electronic parts will be described hereinafter. The signal processing circuit section is mounted on the surface opposite to the surface on which the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are formed. The respective differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to the copper foil pattern on the surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> where the signal processing circuit section is formed via through holes, at the electrodes points <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The pair of differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed as an electrode pattern of a shape symmetric with respect to the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Also, each of the pair of differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed as an electrode pattern of a shape which is symmetric with respect to the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The imaginary line L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is normal to the imaginary L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and/or the reference plane. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each of the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is shaped like a vertical fan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the arc-shaped periphery of each of the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a circular arc which follows the path of a circle with its center at the point of intersection of the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this preferred embodiment, the diameter of the circle is set at 14 mm, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In this case, the open angle S of each of the fan-shaped differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is set according to the desired range of measured tilt angle. This range is set based upon the required output signal of the tilt sensor necessary to provide a linear characteristic to a change in tilt. When the output characteristic of the tilt sensor is required to be linear in the range where the tilt angle from the position where the tilt angle is 0 degree is larger than a predetermined value &thgr;a, the open angle S is defined as S&equals;(90&minus;&thgr;a)&middot;2. In this example, the open angle S is set at 100 degrees for the purpose of making the output characteristic larger than 40 degrees from the tilt angle from the 0 degree position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A reference numeral <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> designates a common electrode plate formed of a conductive material having a desired rigidity. This common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is shaped like a gourd such that the common electrode <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> exactly matches the pair of differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>when it is placed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is mounted on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a state where it is held in parallel to the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with a gap between them. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is mounted by inserting two terminals <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which are integral with the plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and formed by bending the plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at right angles, into the terminal holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>made in the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The terminals <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are then soldered to the surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on which the signal processing circuit section is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the two terminals <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed of the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are formed on the constricted portion of the gourd-like shape of the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and are inserted into the terminal holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>made between the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the portion of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> where the electrode pattern is not formed. This can reduce the tilt detection element size in at least one direction (e.g. the horizontal direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> An oil case <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> formed of plastics having proper flexibility is shaped like a letter U in cross section. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the oil case <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> forms a closed space with the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> when its end face is bonded to the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with bonding means such as a double-faced adhesive tape <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B or a similar adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the common electrode <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and the case <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are arranged so that their opposite faces are parallel to each other and that the center of gravity of the common electrode <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> agrees with that of the case <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The closed space formed by the case <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is filled with a dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> such as a silicone oil or the like. The dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is poured from a through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>made in the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to a level of approximately half of the effective volume in the closed space. This level of the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> defines this level as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>made in the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is filled and sealed with solder from the side of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on which the signal processing circuit section is mounted. After the closed space is filled with the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is easily filled with the solder because it is made in the copper foil pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The linear characteristic portion of the output of the tilt sensor described below is compensated by a differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>pairing with the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is filled and sealed with solder in the like manner described above. In this case, the through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the through hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have the same diameter and are made at positions symmetric with respect to the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The height of the closed space from the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is low, for example, 3 mm, and the distance between the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, is only about 1.5 mm. The dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is injected into the closed space with a nozzle like an injection needle inserted thereto. However the distance between the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the common electrode plate, for example 1.5 mm, is too small to insert an injection needle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in a preferred embodiment and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, through holes <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>having the same diameter are made in the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at positions corresponding to the through holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to ensure an adequate distance to insert the nozzle for injecting the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, for example 3 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Since the through holes <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are symmetric with respect to the imaginary line L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it is possible to compensate the linear characteristic portion of the output of the tilt sensor described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Further, one of the through holes at which the electrode points <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are formed, e.g. the electrode point <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is used as a hole for purging air when the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is injected thereto.

In a preferred embodiment, a clock signal SC is enters the signal processing circuit section through an input terminal <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, this clock signal SC is supplied from a control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> mounted on a control circuit board other than the tilt sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The clock signal SC entered through the input terminal <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and having a predetermined frequency is wave-shaped by a clock buffer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The clock buffer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be for example, a C-MOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) inverter to correct the waveform of the entered input clock signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The output terminal of this clock buffer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is connected to the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the tilt detection element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, as described above. The pair of differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the tilt detection element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are connected to the input terminals of capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The output terminals of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to the input terminals of a differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Although omitted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, this signal processing circuit section is not provided with a conventional power stabilizing circuit as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, but is instead supplied with a stabilized power supply voltage from an outside source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Since the signal processing circuit section of this preferred embodiment is arranged in this manner, the clock signal SC entered through the input terminal <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is wave-shaped by the clock inverter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and then is supplied to the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through first and second capacitors. The wave-shaped clock signal SC is supplied to the capacity-voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, through the first capacitor which includes the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The wave-shaped clock signal SC is also supplied to the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through a second capacitor constituted by the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Here, peak value signals corresponding to the capacity Ca of the first capacitor and the capacity Cb of the second capacitor are supplied to the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively. The capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>rectify the input signals, respectively, and produce smoothed voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The respective output voltages of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have magnitudes corresponding to peak values of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The capacity Ca of the first capacitor and the capacity Cb of the second capacitor are these peak values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> produces the differential voltage between the output voltage of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the output voltage of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as the output of the tilt sensor at the output terminal <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The output voltage of the tilt sensor produced at the output terminal <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is supplied to the control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a microcomputer in which a CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a system bus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a program ROM <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a work area RAM <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and I/O ports <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> supplies the clock signal SC to the input terminal <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the tilt sensor through the I/O port <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. An output voltage from the output terminal <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the tilt sensor is applied to the I/O port <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as a tilt detection output through an A/D converter not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> detects, according to a tilt threshold value detection program stored in the program ROM <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, whether the output voltage of the tilt sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold voltage or not. When the control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> detects that the output voltage exceeds the threshold voltage, the control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> supplies a corresponding control signal to a section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to be controlled to put a predetermined control into practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The tilt sensor provided with the tilt detection element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the signal processing circuit section is mounted on the plane to be measured which is the reference plane for measuring tilt. As described above, the input terminal <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the output terminal <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are connected to the control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The tilt sensor is placed such that the surface of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the tilt detection element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> becomes the plane, including the tilt direction, to be measured, as is the case described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> When the plane to be measured is at the position where it is not actually tilted, e.g the tilt angle is 0 degree (the plane to be measured is a plane including a line normal to the direction of the gravity), the entire differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is dipped in the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. In contrast, the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not exposed at all or remains undipped in the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the capacity Cb of the second capacitor constituted by the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, as a variable capacity corresponding to the amount of immersion in the dielectric liquid, becomes a maximum. On the other hand, the capacity Ca of the first capacitor constituted by the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the common electrode plate <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> becomes a minimum value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graphical view showing output voltage characteristics of a tilt sensor according to an embodiment of the present invention. The difference between the output voltages of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>becomes a maximum and the output voltage of the tilt sensor exhibits a maximum value Vm as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Even when the plane to be measured is tilted in the tilt direction to be measured, as described above, in the range of tilt angle not exceeding 40 degrees in this embodiment, the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>keeps the state in which the nearly all of the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is dipped in the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. That is, the range of tilt angle which does not exceed the angle K&equals;90&minus;S/2 corresponding to the open angle S of fan-shaped differential electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, with respect to the reference plane. Similarly, the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>maintains a state in which the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is hardly dipped in the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the capacity Ca of the first capacitor and the capacity Cb of the second capacitor are hardly varied and the resulting output voltage of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is kept approximately at the voltage Vm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> When the plane to be measured is further tilted in the tilt direction to be measured and the tilt angle exceeds the above-mentioned K, in either of the cases where the direction of tilt is in the direction of &plus;&thgr; or &minus;&thgr;, a part of the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which has been nearly wholly dipped in the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is removed from the surface of the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a part of the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is immersed by the same proportion into the dielectric liquid <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> For this reason, the capacity Ca of the first capacitor formed of the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the common electrode <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is increased and the capacity Cb of the first capacitor formed of the differential electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the common electrode <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the difference between the output voltage of the capacity-voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the output voltage of the capacity-voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is reduced. Then, the output voltage of the tilt sensor is decreased linearly in accordance with an increase in the tilt angle in either of the cases where the direction of tilt is in the &plus;&thgr; or &minus;&thgr; directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Therefore, if the control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> previously determines a single voltage Vth corresponding to a threshold tilt angle th detection and detects whether the output voltage of the tilt sensor is smaller than the voltage Vth, it is possible to detect whether the plane to be measured is tilted more than the threshold tilt angle th. This can be accomplished in either of the cases where the direction of tilt is in the direction of &plus;&thgr; or &minus;&thgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In this case, the control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can detect whether the plane to be measured is tilted more than the threshold tilt angle th or not by means of a software program for monitoring whether the output voltage of the tilt sensor exceeds the single voltage Vth. Therefore, this produces an advantage that monitoring is made by a simple software, as compared with the conventional case where two threshold voltages are monitored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may comprise discrete hardwares instead of the microcomputer. In this case, only a circuit for detecting whether the output voltage of the tilt sensor exceeds the single threshold voltage Vth is required. Therefore, it is not required to arrange two detection circuits for detecting whether the tilt angle exceeds separate threshold values in the direction of &plus;&thgr; or &minus;&thgr; directions, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Also, in the case of the above preferred embodiment, the signal processing circuit is not provided with an oscillator as is the case with the conventional tilt sensor and the clock signal is supplied from an external source. This arrangement can further reduce the size of the tilt sensor of the present invention, including the printed circuit board. Also, eliminating the conventional power stabilizing circuit contributes to reducing the size of the tilt sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The output voltage of the capacity-voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is supplied to the non-inversion input terminal of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the output voltage of the capacity-voltage conversion circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is supplied to the inversion input terminal of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has the characteristics of the output voltage shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> However, if applying the output voltages of the capacity-voltage conversion circuits <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the input terminals of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is the reverse of the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the characteristics of the output voltage of the differential amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is the reverse of those in the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> That is, in the reverse case, when the difference between the capacitance Ca of the first capacitor and the capacitance Cb of the second capacitor is a maximum, the output voltage is a minimum. As the difference between the two capacitances (Ca, Cb) decreases, the output voltage increases. In this case, it is possible to detect whether the plane to be measured is tilted more than the threshold tilt angle th when detecting that the output voltage is larger than the threshold voltage Vth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The output signal varies in the same way in either of the cases where the plane to be measured is tilted in the either the &plus;&thgr; or &minus;&thgr; tilt direction, as described above. Therefore, according to the present invention, the number of threshold values required for detecting a tilt angle larger than a predetermined tilt angle is reduced to one threshold value used for either tilt direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
