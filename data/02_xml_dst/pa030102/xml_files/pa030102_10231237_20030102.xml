<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A gate insulating film is formed of an oxynitride film prepared by adding nitrogen atoms to a thermal oxide film. The Si&mdash;N bonds each having a second adjacent oxygen atom as viewed on the basis of the nitrogen atom within the oxynitride film are positioned at least one atomic layer inside the interface between the silicon substrate and the oxynitride film to allow the gate insulating film to prevent boron atoms contained in the gate electrode from being migrated through the gate insulating film without lowering the driving force of the transistor. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the same, particularly, to a CMOS field effect transistor device and a method of manufacturing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, problems such as generation of a short channel effect are generated in accordance with miniaturization of transistors and, thus, a dual gate CMOS structure is employed for suppressing the short channel effect. In the dual gate CMOS structure, an N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) gate electrode having, for example, arsenic (As) introduced therein is formed in the N-channel transistor, and a P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type polysilicon gate electrode having, for example, boron (B) introduced therein is formed in the P-channel transistor. In the case of employing the dual gate CMOS structure, however, boron in the polysilicon gate electrode of the P-channel transistor is diffused into the underlying silicon (Si) substrate in the subsequent heat treating step, particularly, in the heat treating step for activating the impurities in the source and drain regions, leading to serious problems. For example, the transistor characteristics are deteriorated or changed. Also, the reliability of the gate insulating film is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For overcoming the above problems, it is known to the art to use as the gate insulating film an oxynitride film prepared by adding nitrogen (N) to the gate insulating film. However, if the added nitrogen atoms are present in an excessively large amount at the interface between the oxynitride film and the silicon substrate, the driving force of the transistor is markedly deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The particular problem will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a graph in which transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (not shown) including a gate insulating film having a thickness of 4 nm, to which nitrogen was added by using a N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O gas, is compared with transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (not shown) including a gate insulating film consisting of a thermal oxide film having a thickness of 4 nm in respect of the driving force and the boron punch-through through the gate insulating film. These transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> were prepared by exactly the same method except the method of forming the gate insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> covers the case where a rapid temperature elevation annealing (RTA) was performed at 1020&deg; C. for 20 seconds after introduction of boron into the polysilicon gate of the P-channel transistor. The planar density of the added nitrogen is plotted on the abscissa of the graph. The driving force ratio based on the use of the thermal oxide film (T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is plotted on the ordinate on the right side of the graph. Further, the flat band shifting amount caused by the boron punch-through from the P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-polysilicon layer and the n-well capacitor is plotted on the ordinate on the left side of the graph. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> clearly shows that, where the planar density of the added nitrogen is not less than 2.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the driving force ratio (Idsat/Idsat0) of transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (Idsat) to transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (Idsat0) is not higher than 95% of the thermal oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, where the planar density of the added nitrogen is not higher than 1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the flat band shifting amount caused by the boron punch-through is not smaller than 0.1V, giving rise to a problem in controlling the threshold value. Also, under the planar density noted above, the flat band shifting amount is greatly dependent on the added nitrogen amount. As a result, the transistor characteristics are greatly affected by the nonuniformity in the added nitrogen concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Under the circumstances, where the gate insulating film is 4 nm thick and the RTA is performed at 1020&deg; C. for 20 seconds, it is reasonable to state that an optimum concentration of the added nitrogen, at which both the driving force deterioration and the boron punch-through can be controlled, falls within a range of between 1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and 2.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As described above, in order to provide a CMOS transistor exhibiting good transistor characteristics, it is necessarily required to use an oxynitride film having an optimum nitrogen dose amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the boron punch-through under the typical activation process at 1020&deg; C. for 20 seconds. On the other hand, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a graph showing the dependency of flat band shifting amount on added nitrogen atoms concentration, covering the case where the boron punch-through takes place under the lowermost condition at which the effect of the activation process can be expected, e.g., at 950&deg; C. for 30 seconds. It should be noted that the flat band shifting amount is a good indicator for boron punch-through. A higher flat band shifting amount means that boron atoms are diffused in the Si substrate further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows that nitrogen addition of about 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is required even under the lowermost condition at which the effect of the activation can be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that, where a trade off relationship can be observed between the driving force and the boron punch-through as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the window for the optimum added nitrogen concentration is narrowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the boron punch-through scarcely occurs where the added boron concentration is 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or more. Therefore, a high concentration side can be used only in consideration of the boron punch-through. Incidentally, the boron punch-through is known to be dependent on the film thickness, the activating temperature and time. In the actual process, the film thickness and temperature are nonuniform on the wafer surface, nonuniform depending on the positions within the furnace, and nonuniform among lots (batches). Also, the added nitrogen concentration is somewhat nonuniform. Such being the situation, a margin relating to the boron punch-through is broadened if boron is added on a high concentration side. However, it is a practical serious problem that a sufficiently large process margin cannot be secured because the upper limit of the added nitrogen concentration is determined by the requirement of preventing the driving force of the transistor from being deteriorated. It is proposed in, for example, Japanese Patent Disclosure (Kokai) No. 7-335876 that the nitrogen concentration be lowered in the vicinity of the interface between the silicon substrate and the insulating film by re-oxidation of a N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O oxynitride film so as to suppress deterioration of the driving current. In this case, however, the electron mobility in a region of high electric field, which determines the circuit operating speed, is rather deteriorated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, Sample C). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As described above, it was difficult in the past to prevent the boron punch-through without lowering the driving force of a transistor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The outline of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the driving force of a MOS transistor is lowered with increase in the added nitrogen concentration in a N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O oxynitriding process. The low driving force is caused by the lowering in the mobility of the carriers (electrons and holes) within the inversion layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the mobility of electrons (carriers) within an inversion layer in an oxynitride film formed by an N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O oxynitriding process, relative to the vertical electric field with respect to various concentrations of the added nitrogen atoms. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the carrier mobility is prominently lowered regardless of the added nitrogen concentration in a region where the vertical electric field is relatively weak (0.7 MV/cm). In other words, the carrier is put in a state of low mobility with increase in the amount of the added nitrogen if the operating electric field region alone is taken into account. Therefore, it is reasonable to state that in the case of using an N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O oxynitride film as a gate insulating film, the carrier mobility within an inversion layer is lowered with increase in the amount of the added nitrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Causes of the mobility deterioration in the use of N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O oxynitride film will be mentioned in detail, down below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In general, the mobility (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>) is defined by three mobility components consisting of mobility component (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) owing to the coulomb scattering, mobility component (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>ph</subscript></highlight>) owing to the phonon scattering, and mobility component (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>sr</subscript></highlight>) owing to the surface roughness scattering, as given below: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>1/&mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>&equals;1/&mgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&plus;1/&mgr;<highlight><subscript>ph</subscript></highlight>&plus;1/&mgr;<highlight><subscript>sr </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the ranges a, b, and c respectively indicate ranges where the mobility is determined in accordance with one of the coulomb scattering by electrons (range a), the phonon scattering (range b), and the surface roughness scattering (range c) as a dominant cause therein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The mobility of the hole is also considered to be determined by the mechanism similar to that of the electron. However, since an experimental confirmation of the dependency of each of the coulomb scattering, the phonon scattering and the surface roughness scattering on the vertical electric field, which was performed in respect of the electron mobility, has not yet been performed for the hole mobility, the discussion herein is made just with reference to the electron mobility. However, it is considered reasonable to understand that situations substantially similar to those for the electron mobility accompany the hole mobility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Also, the mobility component (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>ph</subscript></highlight>) owing to the phonon scattering (range b shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), one of the above-mentioned three mobility components, is substantially constant regardless of the nitrogen addition amount to the gate insulation film. However, from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> showing the relationship between the amount of the positive stationary charge and the mobility component owing to the coulomb scattering, it should be clearly understood that the mobility component (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) owing to the coulomb scattering is lowered with increase in the amount of the stationary charge. Since the lowering of the mobility (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>) is caused by the lowering of the mobility component (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) owing to the coulomb scattering, it is important to suppress the lowering of the mobility component (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) owing to the coulomb scattering in order to control deterioration of the mobility (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the amount of the stationary charge is increased with increase in the amount of the added nitrogen. In other words, in the case where an oxynitride film is formed by using N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, the amount of the stationary charge is dependent on the amount of the added nitrogen. Therefore, the lowering of mobility is considered to be caused by the increase in the stationary charge/interfacial level brought about by the nitrogen addition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The coulomb scattering denotes a mutual action between the coulomb potential formed by the charge forming the coulomb scattered body and a carrier in the inversion layer. However, the magnitude of the coulomb potential is exponentially decreased relative to the distance. Therefore, decrease of the mobility is considered to be suppressed, if the coulomb scattered body (stationary charge derived from bonds relating to Si&mdash;N in the case of an oxynitride film) is positioned away from the interface between the silicon substrate and the oxynitride film. In other words, it has been clarified that, in order to suppress the decrease of the mobility, it is important to control the position of the Si&mdash;N bond, in addition to the control of N dose amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to look into the relationship between the Si&mdash;N bond and the mobility, an experiment has been conducted by FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Ray Spectroscopic analysis) using samples A and B to clarify the dependency between the ratio of the peak intensity of the Si&mdash;N bond to that of the Si&mdash;O bond (hereinafter, &ldquo;Si&mdash;N/Si&mdash;O bond peak intensity ratio&rdquo;) and the depth in the gate insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a graph showing a ratio of the peak intensity derived from the presence of the Si&mdash;N bond (more accurately, N&mdash;Si&mdash;O bond or Si&mdash;O&mdash;N bond) observed in the vicinity of 1000 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to the peak intensity of the Si&mdash;O bond observed in the vicinity of 1100 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>(i.e., a signal observed in a thermal oxide film). The Si&mdash;N bond corresponds to a Si&mdash;N bond having a second adjacent oxygen (O) atom as viewed on the basis of the nitrogen atom (N). As seen from the graph, sample A has a profile such that the nitrogen concentration is increased toward the interface with the silicon substrate. On the other hand, sample B has a profile such that a peak of the nitrogen concentration is positioned about one atomic layer inside the interface with the silicon substrate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a graph showing the electron mobility for each of samples A and B having the particular profiles relative to the vertical electric field. As seen from the graph in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the deterioration in the mobility (&mgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>) relative to the vertically effective electric field in sample B is more suppressed, compared with that in sample A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As described above, in order to suppress decrease of mobility, it is important not only to control the N dose amount, but also to add nitrogen to exhibit a profile such that the sites of the Si&mdash;N bonds are positioned about one atomic layer inside the interface to allow the peak of the nitrogen concentration to reside in the particular position. It is possible for the sites of the Si&mdash;N bonds to be positioned in an upper region of the gate insulating film as far as the Si&mdash;N bonds are positioned at least one atomic layer inside the interface with the silicon substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is important to suppress the oxidation reaction in introducing nitrogen in order to allow the Si&mdash;N bonds to be positioned inside the lowermost surface of the gate insulating film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a graph showing the relationships between the oxygen amount contained in the gas introduced into the furnace in the oxynitriding step with NO and an intensity ratio (Y axis on the right side) of the Si&mdash;N bond to the Si&mdash;O bond at the interface with the silicon substrate and between the oxygen amount and the depth from the interface (Y axis on the left side) at which the peak intensity ratio of the Si&mdash;N bond to the Si&mdash;O bond (Si&mdash;N/Si&mdash;O bond peak intensity ratio) assumes the highest value. As apparent from the graph, the Si&mdash;N/Si&mdash;O bond peak intensity ratio is rapidly increased if the oxygen amount exceeds {fraction (1/10)}. Also, the position, i.e., the distance from the interface, at which the Si&mdash;N/Si&mdash;O bond peak intensity ratio is made maximum within the oxynitride film is substantially on the interface, if the oxygen amount is larger than {fraction (1/10)}. The reason for this is considered to be as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Specifically, where the oxynitriding reaction and the oxidizing reaction proceed simultaneously, reconstruction is brought about by the oxidizing reaction at the interface between the silicon substrate and the silicon oxide film (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). As a result, a large number of Si&mdash;Si bonds or Si&mdash;O bonds whose coupling angles are distorted are formed at the interface. In this step, nitrogen is considered to enter the weak Si&mdash;Si coupling portion at the interface. On the other hand, where the oxidizing reaction does not proceed simultaneously with the oxynitriding reaction, Si&mdash;N coupling angle, etc. present in a region several angstroms inward of the lowermost interface is distorted. Further, nitrogen atoms enter the incomplete SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>network, i.e., a so-called &ldquo;sub-oxide region&rdquo;. It follows that, in such a case, the highest nitrogen concentration is formed in a region slightly inward of the lowermost interface of the silicon substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As described above, it is important to suppress generation and remanence of the oxidizing agent as much as possible in the nitrogen introducing step in order to prevent the oxidization of the gate insulating film simultaneous to the nitridation thereof, thereby to allow the Si&mdash;N bond to be positioned inside the lowermost surface of the gate insulating film. Particularly, it is important to suppress the oxygen amount introduced into the furnace to {fraction (1/10)} or less, as apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> (Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> plurality of element isolating oxide films <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed within an N-type silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The element isolating oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in the drawing consists of an STI (shallow trench isolation). Alternatively, a LOCOS isolation can be employed for the element isolation. For example, a P-type impurity and an N-type impurity are introduced separately into the element regions within the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> defined between the adjacent element isolating oxide films <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to form a p-well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an n-well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Then, a gate insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, followed by depositing a polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in a thickness of, for example, 200 nm. How to form the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be described hereinafter in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Then, the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is selectively removed by means of lithography and etching, followed by forming a plurality of gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in some portions of the element regions, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. Further, an after-oxidation is performed for eliminating the damage done by the etching, followed by forming shallow source and drain regions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the PMOSFET region by implanting, for example, boron ions under a lower accelerating energy and by forming shallow source and drain regions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the NMOSFET region by implanting, for example, arsenic ions under a lower accelerating energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> After formation of the source and drain regions, a silicon nitride (SiN) film is deposited on the entire surface, followed by selectively etching the silicon nitride layer by a reactive ion etching (RIE). As a result, side walls <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are formed on both side surfaces of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the next step, a mask is formed in the PMOSFET region by a lithography method, followed by implanting an N-type impurity, e.g., arsenic ions, into the NMOSFET region by using the mask under a predetermined accelerating energy to form source and drain regions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having an impurity concentration lower than that in the source and drain regions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Similarly, a mask is formed in the NMOSFET region by a lithography method, followed by implanting a P-type impurity, e.g., boron ions, into the PMOSFET region by using the mask under a predetermined accelerating energy to form source and drain regions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having an impurity concentration lower than that in the source and drain regions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Then, titanium (Ti) is deposited on the entire surface, followed by forming titanium silicide layers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and 20<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the source and drain regions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and on the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the known salicide technology. Further, a silicon oxide film is deposited in a thickness of, for example, about 900 nm by LPCVD (low pressure chemical vapor deposition) method, followed by flattening the silicon oxide film by, for example, CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) method, thereby forming an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the next step, contact holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed in the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> at positions corresponding to the source and drain regions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the gate electrodes <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, followed by depositing an Al&mdash;Si&mdash;Cu layer on the entire surface in a thickness of about 400 nm. The resultant Al&mdash;Si&mdash;Cu layer is processed by means of lithography and etching to form a wiring layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> connected to the titanium silicide layers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The gate insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed as follows. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> schematically shows a series of process sequence of a furnace including the introduction of a wafer into the furnace, oxidation of the wafer with a diluted oxidizing agent, the oxynitriding and the delivery of the processed wafer out of the furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the nitrogen gas atmosphere within the furnace loaded with the wafer is maintained at, for example, 600&deg; C. Under this condition, the entire wafer surface is oxidized for 3 to 5 minutes under an atmosphere of, for example, 750&deg; C. using a gas prepared by diluting, for example, a dry O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>with N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>10 times as much as the dry O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to form the thin gate insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> in a thickness of, for example, 1 to 2 nm. Then, the inner space of the furnace is consecutively purged with a nitrogen gas to substitute the nitrogen gas for the oxygen gas remaining within the furnace. The purging should be continued until the concentration of the oxygen gas remaining within the furnace is lowered to, for example, about 1 ppm or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Then, an oxynitriding treatment is carried out at about 800&deg; C. for about 30 minutes under a NO atmosphere. In this step, it is important to control the oxynitriding atmosphere such that the oxygen amount within the furnace is {fraction (1/10)} or less of the gas mixture within the furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Where the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed as described above, the NO molecule forms a Si&mdash;NO bond or is separated into nitrogen and oxygen atoms to form a Si&mdash;N bond and a Si&mdash;O bond in the Si&mdash;O network in a sub-oxide region in the vicinity of the interface between the thin gate insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As a result, the nitrogen atoms are introduced into the oxide film. It should be noted that, by carefully controlling the gaseous atmosphere, the nitrogen atoms can be introduced into the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to exhibit a profile that the peak concentration of the nitrogen atoms is formed in a region slightly above the interface between the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The planar density of the added nitrogen within the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> should be at least, for example, 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The upper limit of the added nitrogen concentration, in which Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is formed within the gate insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is about 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, if Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>layer forms a single atomic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The roughness of the interface between the gate insulating film consisting of the oxynitride film formed by the process described above and the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> should be equal to or lower than the roughness of the interface between a thermal oxide film and the silicon substrate. In this case, the carrier mobility across the interface within a region of a high electric field is rendered equal to or higher than that across the interface between the conventional thermal oxide film and the silicon substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the oxynitriding treatment is carried out at 800&deg; C. within a furnace of atmospheric pressure. However, the oxynitriding temperature is not necessarily limited to 800&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The lower limit of the process temperature is determined by the efficiency of nitriding performed by diffusion/reaction of a NO gas. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a graph showing the relationship between the oxynitriding temperature and the added nitrogen concentration (planar density), covering the case where the process time is set at 30 minutes. As apparent from the graph, nitrogen atoms scarcely enter the film under a process temperature of 700&deg; C. or less. On the side of such a low temperature, the amount of nitrogen introduced into the film is not appreciably increased even if the process time is increased because the nitriding efficiency is determined by the reaction coefficient of the NO gas. It follows that the process under temperature of 700&deg; C. or less is not practical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the amount of the introduced nitrogen is increased with increase in the oxynitriding temperature. As described previously, it is generally undesirable to introduce a large amount of nitrogen into the film, because the driving force is deteriorated. However, a low nitrogen concentration can be achieved by performing the process of RTA in units of seconds on the high temperature process side. Under the circumstances, the upper limit of the process temperature is 1100&deg; C. in view of the melting of the silicon substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the peak concentration of the Si&mdash;N bonds within the gate insulating film is positioned inward of the interface with the silicon substrate so as to suppress deterioration of the carrier mobility and to suppress deterioration of the driving force. As a result, the boron punch-through can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that deterioration of the driving force dependent on the added nitrogen concentration is scarcely observed in the oxynitride film formed by the method of the present invention. As a matter of fact, the deterioration of the driving force was suppressed at 96% even where the planar concentration of the added nitrogen atoms was as high as 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Therefore, the window of the optimum nitrogen addition amount was widened to fall within a range of between 1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Since the dependence of the driving force deterioration on the added nitrogen concentration is markedly diminished in the embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to use an oxynitride film having a high-added nitrogen concentration and to ensure a sufficiently large process margin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment described above, the gate insulating film is formed of an oxynitride film. Alternatively, another film such as a radical oxynitride film can be used as the gate insulating film. Further, the present invention can be worked in various modified fashions within the technical scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention provides a semiconductor device in which the impurity contained in the gate electrode is prevented from being migrated through the gate insulating film without lowering the driving force of the transistor and also provides a method of manufacturing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
