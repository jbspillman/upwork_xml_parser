<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a press contact type semiconductor device, particularly, to a press contact type semiconductor device capable of ensuring an uniform contact condition between semiconductor elements and package electrodes, and of decreasing thermal resistance and electrical resistance, and a converter using the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Technology of power electronics, wherein a main circuit current is controlled by using technology of semiconductor electronics, has been applied widely to various fields, and, furthermore, the applied fields have been still expanding. Semiconductor elements for power electronics are as follows: thyristor, light-triggered thyristor, gate-turn-off thyristor (GTO), insulated gate bipolar transistor (hereinafter, called IGBT) which is a MOS controlled device, metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (hereinafter, called MOSFET), and others. In these devices, main electrodes (cathode, emitter electrode) are formed on a first main plane of a semiconductor chip, and other main electrodes (anode, collector electrode) are formed on a second main plane of the semiconductor chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor devices for large power such as GTO, light-triggered thyristor, and the like, the semiconductor element is packaged per every wafer. The both main electrodes of the above element have a structure, wherein the main electrodes are contacted by pressing with a pair of external main electrode plates in the package via an intermediate electrode plate (buffer electrode plate for thermal stress) made of Mo or W. In order to improve uniformity of switching operation, large current turn-off capability, and the like, it is important to make contact conditions among the element electrodes, the intermediate electrode plates, and the external main electrode plates as uniform as possible, and to decrease contact thermal resistance and electrical resistance. Therefore, a countermeasure to decrease warps and waviness by improving precision (flatness, plainness) in manufacturing parts of the package has been generally adopted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a plurality of chips have been mounted mainly by a package composition of wire-connecting electrodes type called a module type structure in IGBT and the like. In case of the module type package, heat generated in the internal of the element chip is released from only one side of the package (a plane which has not been connected by wire), that is, the side of the package where the electrode has been mounted directly on a base substrate. Accordingly, thermal resistance is generally significant, and the number of chips which can be mounted on a package, and an usable current capacity (an amount of heat generation, or a mounting density) were limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Currently, in order to solve the above problems and to respond to a demand for increasing the capacity, a semiconductor device having a press contacting structure of multichips in parallel, wherein a plurality of IGBT chips are assembled in parallel in a flat type package so as to be capable of taking out an emitter electrode and collector electrode formed on the main planes of each chips by plane-contacting to a pair of external main electrode plates provided at the package, such as disclosed in JP-A-8-88240 (1996) has been receiving attentions. In accordance with the semiconductor device having a press contacting structure of multichips in parallel, variations in height of each position of every chips caused by variation in dimensions of the members (parts), and variations in warps and waviness of the main electrode plate per location can not be avoided. Accordingly, the pressure varies per chip, and uniform contacts can not be obtained. Then, the thermal resistance and the electrical resistance per position of every chips varied remarkably, and a serious problem that the characteristics of the elements were unstable as a whole was remained. As the most simply, the problem can be solved by using the members having severely precise dimensions. However, the above countermeasure can not be deemed as realistic, because increasing a production cost and a selection cost of the members can not be avoided. For solving the above problem, JP-A-8-88240 (1996) discloses a method to insert a soft metallic sheet having a ductility such as silver as a thickness correcting plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The size of the element (wafer size) in the package of the GTO and the like will be increased for responding to the demand for increasing their capacities in the future. Accordingly, the warps, waviness, and the like of the package members (electrode members) are in a trend to be increased in accordance with increasing the diameter of the element. The countermeasure to decrease warps and waviness by improving precision in manufacturing parts of the package (flatness, plainness) as described previously has a limit in manufacturing, and a serious problem in cost. Accordingly, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure an uniform contact between the wafer and the package members (electrodes) in the whole plane of the element size (wafer size), and to decrease the thermal resistance and the electrical resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in accordance with the method of inserting a soft metallic sheet disclosed as a countermeasure for solving the problem of uniform contact between chips of the semiconductor device having a press contact structure of multichips in parallel as described previously, it has been revealed by study of the inventors of the present invention that the amount of deformation of the sheet is very little (deforming only by elastic deformation) with a pressure in the range of practical use, i.e. the pressure which does not destroy at least the semiconductor chip, and the amount of deformation is not sufficient for ensuring uniform contact when the variation in height per position of every chips (and the height including the intermediate electrode members interposing the chip, and others) is remarkable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The reason can be estimated that, when a pressure is added to a soft metallic sheet in a thickness direction to cause a plastic deformation in a lateral direction as indicated schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, deformation resistance in the lateral direction becomes extremely large, even if the soft metallic material is used, due to a friction force (friction resistance) <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> generated at the boundary between the electrode members <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> interposing the soft metallic sheet <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Even if the pressure is increased in order to cause a plastic deformation, the friction force is increased in proportion to the pressure, and the plastic deformation can not be readily caused. Particularly, in a case of a sheet form, wherein the area receiving the resistance is remarkably larger than the thickness, influence of the friction force generated on the surface of the area becomes dominant, and even if a pressure exceeding the yield stress of the material known to the public is added, substantial plastic deformation (flow) is not caused practically, and the thickness of the soft metallic sheet is scarcely changed before and after pressing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention is to provide a method for ensuring an uniform press contact condition on a large area region, which has been becoming more difficult than ever in accordance with increasing the size of the package by increasing the diameter of the wafer, and with connecting multichips in parallel of the element corresponding to increasing the capacity. That is, the present invention is to provide a method, which is capable of accommodating the variation in height of the contacting plane (warps, waviness, variation in dimensions of the members, and the like), and of decreasing the thermal resistance and electrical resistance at the contacting boundary planes. The second object of the present invention is to provided a converter preferable for a system of a large capacity by using the semiconductor device obtained by the above methods. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A fundamental application state of the present invention is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. At least a first main electrode is formed on a first main plane, and a second main electrode is formed on a second main plane in a semiconductor element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Intermediate electrode plates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> composed of Mo, W, and the like are arranged above the both main electrode planes, and furthermore, a pair of main electrode plates (common electrode plates) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> composed of Cu, or a Cu alloy are arranged at outer side portions of the intermediate electrode plates. In accordance with the present embodiment, a metallic body having macroscopic vacancies inside such as a metallic netting, or a metallic plate manufactured to be uneven <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, is inserted between the intermediate electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the main electrode plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and all the members are contacted each other by pressing the whole together. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> indicates examples in the order of increasing the total height of the member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the position of (a), (b), and (c). Corresponding to these heights, the thickness of the metallic netting, or the metallic plate manufactured to be uneven <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which were a definite thickness before the pressing, have been decreased in the order of (a), (b), and (c) by crushing and thinning. That means, the metallic netting, or the metallic plate manufactured to be uneven, is deformed by pressing so that the total heights including the height of the metallic netting, or the metallic plate manufactured to be uneven (a sum of the heights of the members <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) become equal at the positions of (a), (b), and (c), and their thickness is varied. Therefore, even in a case if each of the above members <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> differs each other in thickness, and the main electrode plates <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> have warps and waviness, the semiconductor element can be mounted with ensuring a desirable press contact state at the plural chip positions (a), (b), and (c), and a semiconductor device having less variation in thermal resistance and electrical resistance can be realized. In accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an example wherein the metallic netting, or the metallic plated manufactured to be uneven <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is inserted in the plane contacting with pressure facing to the main electrode plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the intermediate electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is indicated. However, the inserted position can be at other contacting planes such as between the main electrode plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the intermediate electrode plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, between the element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the intermediate electrode plates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and plural contacting planes can be used concurrently. Furthermore, the metallic netting different each other, or the metallic plates manufactured to be uneven different each other per each of the planes between the electrodes can be arranged. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the states of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), loading is too small, and the amount of deformation in the thickness direction of the metallic netting is small. Since the contacting electrical resistance between the electrode plate and the metallic netting depends significantly on the pressure, values of the electrical resistance is decreased remarkably in accordance with increasing the pressure. If further larger load is added, the metallic netting <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> provided between the electrode plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the electrode plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is deformed significantly by compression as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). That is, metallic wires (fiber) composing the metallic netting are deformed significantly with compression, and the thickness of the metallic netting is decreased. This is because the load is concentrated to the portion where the metallic netting is contacted with the electrode plates <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the pressure applied to this portion becomes extremely higher than the apparent pressure, and the metallic netting starts to be readily deformed by compression. Since the metallic netting has a large amount of openings, spatial restriction against the deformation of the pressed metal is reduced, which is different from the case of a dense metallic foil (thin plate) indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, and the metallic netting is easily deformed by pressure. Accompanied with this deformation, the contacting area between the surface of the electrode plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the electrode plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the metallic netting is increased. Furthermore, since the amount of deformation of this portion is significant, oxide film on the surface of the metal is broken and a desirable contact with newly generated plane can be obtained. Therefore, the contacting boundary planes generated at this time are in a very closely contacting state. In accordance with this effect, the electrical resistance is decreased further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> After the deformation of the metallic netting is generated sufficiently, the pressure at the contacting plane is not increased so much even if the loading is increased, because the electrode plates <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the metallic netting <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are contacted with a large area. Furthermore, since the deformation resistance is increased by the same reason as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, variation rate of the amount of deformation is decreased as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Theoretically, if an infinite loading can be added, the deformation until the interval between the boundary planes can be filled completely can be achieved. Practically, the interval can not be filled completely on account of the restriction of the loading and the like, and some portions are remained as uncontacted. However, the effect of the uncontacted portions to the electrical resistance is not significant, and a desirably small electrical resistance can be obtained. In accordance with observed results on the thermal resistance, approximately same behavior as the observed results on the electrical resistance was indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The metallic netting referred to in the present invention includes, in addition to a sheet of netting woven with metallic fiber by various weaving manner, a sheet of netting woven with conductive fiber such as carbon fiber and the like, and a sheet material having a complex structure composed of an organic resin of core and a metal of surface layer. The material for the metallic fiber can be selected from the group consisting of soft metals having a small electrical resistance and thermal resistance such as copper, aluminum, silver, gold, and the like; significantly soft metal such as soldering material and the like; materials of inexpensive and superior in oxidation resistance such as nickel, stainless steel (SUS), and the like; and materials superior in high temperature characteristics as Ni base alloys and the like such as inconel and the like; and the material having the most suitable characteristics in consideration of the applied target can be selected. Corresponding to the amount of deformation, electrical resistance, and thermal resistance required in the region of necessary loading, optimization in using of various weaving manner such as plain weaving, twill weaving, plain tatami weaving, twill tatami weaving, and the like; various diameters of fiber; various mesh sizes; and others is desirable. Generally speaking, the amount of deformation can be increased if the diameter of the fiber is increased. On the other hand, in order to control the range of the loading wherein the deformation occurs, it is generally effective to decrease the mesh size for increasing the number of contacting points of the netting with the electrodes. Since the amount of deformation of the complex sheet material, wherein resin fiber is coated with metal, can be made larger than that of the sheet material made of metallic fiber, it is particularly effective in use, which requires a large amount of elastic deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The metallic plate manufactured to be uneven referred to in the present invention means a metallic body, which is manufactured so as to have different thickness depending on positions, in contrast with conventional metallic plate, metallic foil, and metallic sheet, which generally mean a flat dense body having substantially an uniform thickness. Metallic plates called by various names such as expanded metal, meshed metal, grid metal, slit metal, punched metal, embossing manufactured plate, dimple manufactured plate, wave plate, and the like are included in the metallic plates of the present invention. Representative examples of shapes are indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as the cross sectional shapes of the models, and examples of appearance photographs are indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> ((a) expanded metal, (b) slit manufactured plate, and (c) embossing manufactured plate). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As an example of metallic plate manufactured to be uneven, a model of deformation processes of a wave plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> caused by pressing is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) indicates a contacting state before causing a significant deformation by pressure, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) indicates a state during deformation, and (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) indicates a state after deformation has been occurred sufficiently by pressure. In accordance with increasing the load, the wave plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided between the electrode plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the electrode plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is significantly deformed in a certain range of pressure, which is determined by the plate thickness, material of the plate, manufactured waving pitch, manufactured shape, and others. That means, the waving shape portion which has been manufactured to be uneven is deformed significantly by compressing, and thickness of the wave plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is decreased. Different from the case of a dense metallic foil (thin plate) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, relatively large pressure deformation can re readily obtained, because a large number of spaces are existed around the portion manufactured to be uneven as much as manufactured to be uneven and the deformation of the pressed metal is scarcely restricted spatially. In accordance with the deformation, the contacting area of the surfaces of the electrode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the wave plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is increased. Furthermore, since the amount of deformation of this contact portion is significant, the oxide film on the surface of the metal is broken and a desirable contact with newly generated plane can be obtained. Therefore, the contacting boundary planes generated at this time are in a very closely contacting state. In accordance with these effects, the electrical resistance and the thermal resistance is decreased significantly. After the wave plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> deformed significantly, the electrodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> come to contact with the wave plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a remarkably large area, and the pressure per area is not increased so much even if the applied load is increased. Furthermore, the variation rate of the amount of deformation becomes small, because the deformation resistance is increased as same as the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As the material for the metallic plate, the material having the most suitable characteristics corresponding to the applied target can be selected from the group consisting of copper, aluminum, silver, gold, soldering material, nickel, stainless steel (SUS), and various alloys such as Ni base alloys and the like as same as the previous case. Regarding the thickness of original plate manufactured to be uneven, and the depth and pitches of the manufacturing to make uneven, the most suitable conditions corresponding to the amount of deformation, electrical resistance, and thermal resistance required for the necessary pressure range can be selected. The most suitable material and surface processing are desirably selected depending on the using condition of the semiconductor device based on which must be prior to whether decreasing the thermal resistance and electrical resistance, or improving the deformation capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When ensuring the large amount of deformation is desirable, any of a method of arranging the metallic netting, or the metallic plates manufactured to be uneven into plural different positions between electrodes, and a method of arranging a combined assembly of plural metallic netting, or plural metallic plates manufactured to be uneven into an interval between electrodes is desirable. When the combined assembly of the plural metallic netting or the plural metallic plates manufactured to be uneven is used, a pre-treatment to assemble them into a body previously is effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Since these materials have elastic-plastic deformation capabilities, a return as much as the elastic deformation can be observed when the loading is discharged after deformed. However, the plastic deformation corresponding approximately to the variation in height among mounted members can be ensured. In case of re-pressing, sufficient contacts can be ensured with the same pressure as previous pressure utilizing the elastic deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As a method for decreasing the contacting resistance between the metallic netting, or the metallic plate manufactured to be uneven with electrodes interposing them, forming a metallic layer, which is softer and more oxidation resistant than the metallic material of the metallic netting and the metallic plate, onto the surface of the metallic netting or the metallic plate by means such as printing, plating, and the like is desirable. Particularly, it is effective when a hard metallic material, or a readily oxidized metal is used. For instance, a Ni netting or a Ni plate manufactured to be uneven coated with a soft film made of Ag or Au, or a metallic netting or a metallic plate manufactured to be uneven made of Cu or Al having an oxidation preventing film made of Ag or Au at its surface is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as another method, a method of arranging a dense metallic foil onto the surface of the metallic netting, or the metallic plate manufactured to be uneven, and forming a body together can be used. For the above metallic foil, using a metallic foil which is softer and more oxidation resistant than the metallic material of the metallic netting and the metallic plate is effective. For instance, a metallic netting or a metallic plate manufactured to be uneven made of Cu or Al having a metallic foil made of any of Cu, Al, Ag, Au, and the like on its surface is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In order to realize correction of heights, and decrease of electrical resistance and thermal resistance most suitably, not only a metallic netting or a metallic plate manufactured to be uneven, but also a soft metallic foil can be arranged concurrently between the electrodes. For instance, a method for ensuring approximately same amount of deformation with the same loading even if the contacting areas differ each other by inserting an Au foil between the upper main electrode plate and the intermediate electrode plate, and inserting a metallic netting or a metallic plate manufactured to be uneven between the lower main electrode plate and the intermediate electrode plate is effective. </paragraph>

An interval between the above pair of common main electrode plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is insulated externally by an insulating outer cylinder <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of ceramics and the like, and a hermetic structure is formed at an interval between the common main electrode plate and the insulating outer cylinder by sealing inside the package by a metallic plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The gate electrode lead is taken out to outside the package by a sealed wiring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> through the external cylinder <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The whole thickness of the wave plate including the initial uneven portion was 0.6 mm. Variation in thickness of the intermediate electrode plate mounted practically in the present embodiment was 100 &mgr;m at maximum. However, results of determining pressure distribution by inserting pressure sensitive paper between the intermediate electrode plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the chips <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> revealed that the pressure difference was small, and they were pressed almost uniformly. </paragraph>

Main electrodes (collector, cathode) at lower side of each of these semiconductor chips are made of Au, and are connected to an intermediate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, whereon an Ag plated film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of 2-3 &mgr;m thick is formed previously, by heating and pressure welding. On the other hand, main electrodes (emitter, anode) at upper side of each of these semiconductor chips are made of Al, and are connected to an intermediate electrode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, whereon an Au plated film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of 1-2 &mgr;m thick is formed previously.

Main electrodes (collector, cathode) at lower side of each of these semiconductor chips are made of Au, and are connected to an intermediate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, whereon an Ag plated film of 2-3 &angst; m thick is formed previously, by heating and pressure welding.

The above integrated bodies of electrodes and semiconductor chips are inserted between a first common main electrode plate (Cu) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a second common main electrode plate (Cu) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.

In accordance with the present embodiment, the complex netting made of Cu was used, and its surface was plated with Au in order to decrease the contacting resistance, further.

A porous metallic plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as an example of metallic body having macroscopic vacancies inside, is inserted between the intermediate electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the main electrode late <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and each of the members are contacted by pressing its whole body together. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> indicates a case when a sum of the heights of the members <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is increased in the order at the positions of (a), (b), and (c). Corresponding to the difference of these heights, the thickness of the porous metallic plates <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are decreased in the order of (a), (b), and (c) after contacting with pressure, although their thickness before contacting have been same. That means, the thickness of the porous metallic plate has been varied so as to make the whole height including the height of the porous metallic plate (a sum of the members <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) equal at the positions of (a), (b), and (c). Therefore, even if each of the members <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has various thickness, and even if the main electrode plates <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> have warps and waviness, a preferable contacting state with pressure can be ensured at plural chip positions (a), (b), and (c), and the semiconductor chips can be mounted with the preferable contacting state. Accordingly, a semiconductor device having less variation in thermal resistance and electrical resistance can be realized . In accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, an embodiment, wherein the porous metallic plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is inserted between contacting planes with pressure facing to the main electrode plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the intermediate electrode plate <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is indicated. However, the inserting position can be varied to other contacting planes, such as between the main electrode plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the intermediate electrode plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, between the element <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the intermediate electrode plates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and plural boundary planes can be used concurrently. Furthermore, various porous metallic plates made of different material each other can be arranged at respective of intervals between the electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The porous metal referred to in the present invention is metallic material including a large number of voids, while terminology of metallic plate, metallic foil, and metallic sheet mean in general substantially dense metallic members. The porous metal has a fine structure, wherein three dimensional random network of continuous metallic portions is formed. Examples of the porous metal include foamed metal, sponge metal, porous metal, foam metal, and the like. In accordance with the target of the present invention, the soft materials having a small electrical resistance and thermal resistance such as copper, aluminum, silver, gold, and the like, and materials of inexpensive and superior in oxidation resistance such as nickel, stainless steel (SUS), and the like are preferable in particular, and the material having the most suitable characteristics in consideration of the applied target can be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> indicates the effects of the pressure on the amount of deformation (the amount of change in the thickness of porous metallic plate) and electrical resistance, determined by using a porous Cu plate (foamed metal copper plate) as the representative of the porous metallic plate. As a comparative example, a case when a conventional dense thin Cu plate is used is concurrently indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The foamed metal copper plate is prepared by the steps of; forming a coated film of copper powder on surface of vacancies in foamed urethane by dry adhesion method; removing the urethane by thermal processing; and sintering the copper powder in a reducing atmosphere. The foamed metal copper plate is a porous copper metal plate having a three dimensional network skeleton of copper. Another method, wherein Cu coating film is formed on surface of foamed resin by a wet plating method, is similarly usable. Thickness of the porous Cu plate is decreased accompanied with increasing pressure. The porous Cu plate is deformed significantly in a specific pressure region (approximately 0.5-2 kg/mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), and the amount of deformation is decreased accompanied with increasing its density. The electrical resistance is decreased with increasing the pressure, and is changed significantly in the specific region of remarkable deformation of the porous Cu plate. On the contrary, in case of Cu thin plate, significant deformation caused by plastic deformation is not generated even if a pressure exceeding its yield stress is applies as explained previously (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>), but only minor deformation as much as elastic deformation is generated. Electrical resistance is decreased gradually, because contact resistance with measuring electrode is decreased in accordance with increasing pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In case of the porous metal, different from the case of dense metal foil (thin plate) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>), a large deformation can be occurred by relatively small pressure, because the porous metal itself has vacancies at its interior portion, and microscopically the material pressed with a force can be moved easily to these vacancies. The deformation is occurred substantially only in a thickness direction (a pressing direction), because the porous metal itself has vacancies, which make it possible to absorb the deformation, at its interior portion, and deformation resistance by friction in a lateral direction at the contacting planes. Accordingly, the porous metal after the deformation has less vacancies than the initial period, and becomes dense. The shape of the vacancy is varied to be flatten in the thickness direction. As described above, the material of the present invention makes it possible to decrease electrical resistance and thermal resistance effectively with ensuring an capability to cause significant deformation to the thickness direction, because the material of the present invention has a feature that metallic channel portion particularly in the thickness direction is more increased by deformation with pressure in comparison with the lateral direction. When conventional dense material is deformed (decreasing its thickness) significantly, the material as much as its changed volume flows plastically in the lateral direction, and a phenomenon that side plane of the material is swelled remarkably can be observed. However, when the porous material is used, its side plane is scarcely swelled even if it is deformed (decreasing its thickness) significantly, because the porous metal itself has sufficient vacancies, which makes it possible to absorb the deformation of the material, at its interior portion. Therefore, since any problems such as contacting with adjacent material are not generated, the porous material is suitable for high density mounting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Since these materials have elastic-plastic deformation capabilities, a return as much as the elastic deformation can be observed when the loading is discharged after deformed. However, the plastic deformation corresponding approximately to the variation in height among mounted members can be ensured. In case of re-pressing, sufficient contacts can be ensured with the same pressure as previous pressure utilizing the elastic deformation. Furthermore, since the porous material has a lower apparent elastic coefficient than the conventional dense material on account of the presence of voids, the amount of elastic deformation is large, and the porous material is suitable for maintaining a certain contacting state. The pressure causing the deformation, and the elastic-plastic deforming behavior can be controlled by the thickness, density (fraction of the vacancies), and material of the continuous portion of metal formed in three dimensions. These factors can be selected so as to cause the deformation by an appropriate pressure in accordance with the using condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> When ensuring a large amount of deformation is desired, a large fraction of vacancy in the porous metallic material before the deformation is desirable, larger than 50% is desirable, and particularly a range of 60-80% is preferable. However, when the amount of deformation is not desired to be excessively large in view of operability based on its use, it is desirable to adjust the porous plate to have an optimum amount of deformation, thermal resistance, and electrical resistance in view of its use by decreasing the void fraction (densification) by pressing previously with a designated pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the contacting resistance (electricity, heat) in the practical using condition at a boundary with the electrodes interposing the porous metallic plate becomes an important factor. In order to decrease the contacting resistance further, it is important to make the contacting resistance at the boundary with the electrodes interposing the porous metallic plate small as possible. Therefore, a microscopic shape at the outermost surface of the porous metallic plate is more desirable to be a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), which has a large number of terminal parts in approximately parallel to the contacting surface, or of terminal parts <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having a large declining angle as possible, than a structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), which has a large number of columnar metal <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> extruding perpendicularly to the contacting surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As another state of the porous metallic plate for decreasing the contacting resistance of the porous metallic plate with electrode materials interposing the porous metallic plate, it is effective to make the surface of the porous metallic plate denser than its internal portion to increase microscopic contacting area with the electrode material. Embodiments are indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> indicates an embodiment, wherein a metallic layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which is softer and more oxidation resistant than the metallic material of the porous metallic plate, is formed onto the surface of the porous metallic plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by means such as printing, plating, and the like. For instance, a porous metallic plate made of Ni coated with a soft film made of Ag or Au, or a porous metallic plate made of Cu or Al having an oxidation preventing film made of Ag or Au at its surface is used. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) indicates an embodiment, wherein a dense metallic foil <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is arranged onto the surface of porous metallic plate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a body is formed together. For the above metallic foil, using a metallic foil which is softer and more oxidation resistant than the metallic material of the porous metallic plate, in addition to the same material as the porous metallic material, is effective. For instance, a porous metallic plate made of Cu or Al having a metallic foil made of any of Cu, Al, Ag, Au, and the like on its surface is used. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) indicates a cross section of a plate obtained by punching out from the material indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) with a pressing machine. Because the end planes are crushed when pressing is performed, the porous metallic plate becomes a shape that side planes are also covered with the surface foil. Therefore, the above method is simple and convenient method for a case when side planes of the porous metallic plate are desirably protected with a dense film. As further another method, a method for increasing its density only at the surface of the porous metallic plate by exposing it to a high temperature for a short time can be used. </paragraph>

In this case, a porous Ni plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> was inserted between the intermediate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the common main electrode late <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the whole body was pressed via both of the common main electrode plates <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The porous Ni plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> was obtained by the steps of; processing foamed resin for making it have conductivity, plating with electrolytic Ni, heat treating for removing the foamed resin by burning. This material was further pressed to be formed as a plate material having a void diameter of approximately 0.2 mm, the number of cells of 60 pieces/inch, thickness of the metallic channel portion of 40-80 &mgr;m, plate thickness of 0.6 mm, and void fraction of approximately 80%. In accordance with the present embodiment, the contacting resistance between the porous Ni plate and the above electrodes is reduced significantly, because both of the surfaces of electrodes at both sides interposing the porous Ni plate are plated with Ag. Variation in thickness at each position of the chips mounted practically in the present embodiment was 100 &mgr;m at maximum. However, results of determining pressure distribution by inserting pressure sensitive paper between the intermediate electrode plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the common main electrode plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> revealed that the pressure difference was small, and they were pressed almost uniformly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In order to realize correction of the height and decrease of the electrical resistance and the thermal resistance at optimum, not only the porous metallic plate, but also soft metal foil can be inserted concurrently between the electrodes. For instance, a following method is effective; wherein an Au foil is inserted between the upper main electrode plate and the intermediate electrode plate, and a porous Ni plate is inserted between the lower main electrode plate and the intermediate electrode plate, for ensuring approximately same amount of deformation with a same loading even in a case when the contacting areas differ each other. </paragraph>

Accordingly, the contacting resistance between the porous metallic plate and the intermediate electrode plate, and the common electrode plate could be decreased significantly. The above effect was remarkable in the region where the pressure was small, and the contacting resistance could be decreased from &frac15; to {fraction (1/10)}. Variation in thickness at each position of the chips mounted practically in the present embodiment was 200 &mgr;m at maximum. However, results of determining pressure distribution by inserting pressure sensitive paper between the intermediate electrode plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the common main electrode plate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> revealed that the pressure difference was small, and they were pressed almost uniformly. </paragraph>

However, even if surface of the common electrode plates and the intermediate electrode plates, which interposes the porous metallic plate, soft metal foil, and the like is coarse such that its maximum surface roughness (Rmax) exceeds 1 &mgr;m, the material is deformed matching with uneven shape of the surface, and contacting area is increased microscopically and contacting resistance can be decreased. Therefore, production cost can be decreased. </paragraph>

Furthermore, the above embodiments are explained using mainly IGBT, but targets of the present invention are all the semiconductor elements comprising at least a first main electrode on a first main plane and a second main electrode on a second main plane. Therefore, the present invention can be applied to the insulated gate type transistors (MOS transistor) other than the IGBT, the insulated gate type thyristors (MOS controlled thyristor) including IGCT (Insulated Gate Controlled Thyristor), GTO, thyristors, and diodes, and others in a similar way.

Furthermore, the press contact type semiconductor device of the present invention can be used for variable speed pumped storage power plant, substation facilities in building, substation facilities for railway, sodium-sulfur (NaS) battery systems, and converter for traction and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, uniform press contact state in a large area region, which has been becoming more difficult with increasing the size of package accompanied with increasing the diameter of wafer and increasing the number of chips connected in parallel in an element corresponding to increasing the capacity, can be easily realized with a relatively low pressure. That is, the variation in height of the contacting plane can be absorbed sufficiently, and thermal resistance and electrical resistance at contacting boundary planes can be decreased. </paragraph>
