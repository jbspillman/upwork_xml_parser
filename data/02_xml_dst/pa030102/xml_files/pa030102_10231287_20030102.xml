<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of friction stir welding which may be used in welding, for example, aluminum alloy material frame members; and, more particularly, the invention relates to a method of friction stir welding which may be used, for example, in a case where the heights of portions of two abutting aluminum alloy frame members to be joined by welding differ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As disclosed in Japanese application patent laid-open publication No. Hei 9-309164 (EP 0797043A2), a friction stir welding method is a method in which, by rotating a round rod (called a rotary tool) which is inserted into a welding portion of two abutting frame members to be subjected to welding and moving the rotary tool along a welding line; the welding portion of the two frame members to be subjected to the welding is thermoplastically heated so as to be plastically fluidized and welded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The rotary tool comprises a small diameter portion to be inserted into the joint of the welding portion and a large diameter portion which is positioned outside of the small diameter portion. The small diameter portion of the rotary tool and the large diameter portion of the rotary tool are positioned on the same axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The large diameter portion of the rotary tool and the small diameter portion of the rotary tool are simultaneously rotated. The welding according to the friction stir welding method is applied to an abutting portion and an overlapping portion of the two frame members to be subjected to the welding, which members are made of aluminum alloy materials, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Further, to the welding portion of one frame member to be subjected to the welding, there is provided a raised portion which protrudes in a direction toward the large diameter portion of the rotary tool. This raised portion of the frame member is provided integrally with an end portion in a width direction of a hollow extruded frame member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The above-stated raised portion provides material for burying a gap which is formed between the two hollow extruded frame members during welding. When a side of the raised portion of the frame member forms an outer face of a product, for example, an outer side of a car body of a railway vehicle, after the welding the remnants of the raised portion of the frame member are cut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When the above-stated raised portion is provided on the extruded frame member, the raised portion can be provided to extend along an extruding direction. However, the raised portion of the frame member can not be provided at an end portion of the extruded portion; in other words, the raised portion of the frame member can not be provided at a rectangular direction against the side of the raised portion. As a result, when the extruded frame members are arranged to be orthogonal to each other and the end portions of the extruded frame members are subjected to welding according to a friction stir welding method, a raised portion exists at an end portion of one extruded frame member, however a corresponding raised portion does not exist on the other extruded frame member at the welding portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is considered that a good welding of the two extruded frame members can not be carried out, because one of the extruded frame members does not have a raised portion at the welding portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The above stated fact applies generally to a case in which the height of the surfaces in the width direction of the two extruded frame members of the welding portion differ from each other; in other words, for a case in which the height of the surface in the width direction of one frame member differs from the height of the surface in the width direction of the other frame member. The typical situation is that the height of the surface in the width direction of the one frame member is higher or lower than the height of the surface in the width direction of the other frame member. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a method of friction stir welding wherein a good welding can be obtained even when the height of the surfaces of the two members at the welding portion differ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The above stated object can be attained when the height of the surfaces of the two members at the welding portion differ, by welding a pad on the surface of a member at a low side, followed by friction stir welding of the welding portion of the two members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Further, the above statement that &ldquo;the heights of the surfaces of the two members at the welding portion differ&rdquo; refers to a case in which the above-stated surface side, for example, extends toward an upper portion or a lower portion; however, when the rotary tool is standard as a determination of a position, it means that the distance from the rotary tool to the surface of the welding portion differs, for example. The above reference to &ldquo;the member being on the low side&rdquo; indicates a member which is at a larger distance from the rotary tool.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A friction stir welding method according to the present invention as applied to a car body of a railway vehicle will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the side structure of the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a railway vehicle is constituted by combining plural aluminum alloy extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The extruding direction of the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which are made of aluminum alloy materials and are arranged on either side of a doorway <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the extruding direction of the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed between a window <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and another frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed adjacent to the doorway <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, extend in the vertical direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The extruding direction of the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which are made of aluminum alloy materials and are disposed below a window <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, extends in a lateral direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In other words, the extruding direction of the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the extruding direction of the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are orthogonal to each other. The extruding direction of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which is made of aluminum alloy materials and is disposed at an upper portion of the car body above the doorway <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, also extends in a lateral direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> indicates a bougie frame of the car body. These members are welded together using a friction stir welding method and an ordinary MIG welding method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the friction stir welding of the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to each other in which the extruding directions are the same will be explained. The friction stir welding of the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is carried out in a similar manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The extruded frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (similarly to the frame members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) comprises a flat plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> forming an outside surface of the car body and in an inside surface of the car body, and plural ribs <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are arranged on the inside surface of the flat plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The rib <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is provided to extend along the extruding direction of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (similar to the frame members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> At one end (an end portion where the frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> abut each other) in the width direction (the direction orthogonal to the extruding direction of the extruded frame member) of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, there is a raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on the inside of the car body (the rib <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> side). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The height of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown as h. A face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed by the end portion of the plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the end portion of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is arranged to be substantially orthogonal to an upper face or an apex <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are abutted, the faces <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the end portions of the plates <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> come into close contact with each other. However, this is an ideal case. The abutted portion actually is said to have an I-shaped groove form structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When friction stir welding is carried out on two abutting frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in order to not create a gap between the two frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, (to maintain the gap at a predetermined value), the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are restrained or clamped on a stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, each extruded frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mounted on the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> directed upward. Further, the welding portion formed by the ends of the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is disposed in close contact with the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which is made of a steel material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which is a tool for carrying out the friction stir welding of the two frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is inserted into the welding portion from above. The rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is constituted by a large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and a small diameter portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> disposed at the tip end (a low end) of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A boundary surface <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> (formed by an outer peripheral surface of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) between the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has an arc shape which is recessed into the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The small diameter portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a screw structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> During the friction stir welding, the raised portion of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends into the recess formed by the boundary surface <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> (the outer peripheral portion of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>). In other words, the boundary surface <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is recessed by an amount which is intermediate (a length is a protrusion depth h) between the apex <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(a face of a non-raised portion) at the inner surface of the plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The friction stir welding is carried out by rotating the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and inserting it into the welding portion of the two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>; and, while continuing the rotation, moving the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> along a welding line between the two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The axial center line of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is positioned in alignment with the end face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Further, the axial center of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is inclined relative to the moving direction of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the front end of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the direction of movement is positioned to an outer face side (in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an upper portion from the apex <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) of the apex <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A rear end of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is positioned to engage the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (to a depth indicated by a line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In other words, during welding, the rear end of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> extends into the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to a position between the apex <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and an extension line of the face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The above-stated terms &ldquo;front&rdquo; and &ldquo;rear&rdquo; are defined with reference to the moving direction of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The relationships between the sizes of the respective constructive parts will be explained. The width WI of the apexes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the raised portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the two raised portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are abutted is larger than the diameter d of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, but is smaller than the diameter D of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. However, the width W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the apex <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>also can be formed to be larger than the diameter D of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A width W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the base portion formed by two raised portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is larger than the diameter D of the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The height H of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, when the raised portion of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends into the recess formed by the boundary surface <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, has a size such that the tip end of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> approaches the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> during welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For example, the distance between the outer face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the tip end of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is approximately 0.1 mm during welding. In other words, the dimensions of the rotary tool and the movement thereof are set to prevent the tip end of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool from contacting the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> during welding. The surface of the apex <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are joined by an inclined face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> After the two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> have been fixed to the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the friction stir welding is carried out. The apparatus for rotating the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has rollers which move to accompany movement of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> along the weld. The rollers provided on the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are arranged on a right side and a left side at a front portion and a rear portion of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the direction of movement of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> along the weld. When the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is inserted into the weld portion of the two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the rollers contact the faces <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are thereby pressed against the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a state or a condition of the two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> after completion of the friction stir welding according to the present invention. The material of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into which the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> has been inserted is supplied to a gap which is formed between the two abutting frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and flows out to the outside face of the two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as a facet. Also, part of the material remains as a fin on either edge of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a central portion of the two raised portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> forms a recessed portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The gap between the two frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is filled by the material which is softened by the rotation of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. For example, the material of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is moved in above-stated gap and the gap is filled in by this material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> From the tip end of the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a softened material is moved to a lower portion of the gap, and then the gap is filled in by the softened material. As a result, the lower boundary of the gap (at the lower end of the frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) is formed substantially in the same plane as the outer face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the plate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The reference numeral <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> indicates a welding bead which is formed to fill this gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Since the outer face of the welding bead is formed substantially in the same plane as the outside face <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the thickness of the putty used during the welding can be made thin. Further, since there is a raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on the outer face on which the bead <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> does not exist, it can be finished using the hair line processing having no coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an assembly of the welded frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an assembly of the two extruded frame members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, arranged as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, are mounted on and fixed to the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In advance, the rib <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the welding portion (at both ends of the frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) is cut off, so that the end surfaces of this extruded frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are formed smoothly. As a result, when the above-stated welding in this embodiment is carried out according to the friction stir welding method, the area in the vicinity of the welding portion can be pressed by rollers into firm contact with the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Next, as seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, at the abutting portions (the welding portions) of the two assemblies, a welding pad is provided along the end portions of the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It is desirable to provide welding pads <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having a height and a width which corresponds to the height and a width of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, it is desirable to dispose a continuous welding pad along to the welding line, but it is also possible to provide intermittently disposed welding pads. For example, the individual welding pads may be about 1 cm in length and be disposed at about 1 cm intervals along the welding line. The strength of these welding pads has to be sufficient that, during the friction stir welding, the material is not thrown out by the rotating action of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. An allowance will be permitted for the fact that the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> will cause the material to be thrown up; since this facilitates the formation of the recessed portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As stated above, the friction stir welding is carried out on the frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that the outer faces <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the plates <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are aligned substantially in the same plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When there is no welding pad portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, since the large diameter portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the small diameter portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can not extend sufficiently into the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the material of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is splashed out and the filling of the material into the gap becomes insufficient. As a result, a good welding of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can not be obtained. However, in this embodiment according to the present invention, since the welding pad portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> on the frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> serves to supplement the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a good welding can be carried out on the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The welding pad portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed intermittently in this embodiment according to the present invention; however, material will move from the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the side of the frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> during welding. Further, in response to the rotation and the movement of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the materials of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the welding pads <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are moved toward a rear portion of the rotary tool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. As a result of such movement of material along the welding line, a good welding where no welding pad <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> exists can be substantially achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The welded portion in this case becomes substantially as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The remnants of the raised portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are provided on one side of the welded portion and the remnants of the welding pad portions which form the raised portion of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are provided on the other side of the welded portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> When the outer face of the car panel is finished without painting, the above stated welding of the pads is carried out according to the TIG welding method. The filler material is the same material as the frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this regard, by cutting the frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the filler material is provided. For example, the end materials of the frame members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be used for the filler material. According to this embodiment, there is no change of color at the welding portion, so that a nice appearance can be obtained. When the filler material is another material, a change of color appears at the welding portion and a nice appearance can not be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the above stated embodiment according to the present invention, after welding the pads, the frame members may be installed on the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to form the panels. In the above stated embodiment of the present invention, the welding of the extruded frame members to each other is effected for constituting the side structure body, however such welding techniques can be used to join other members as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. An extruded frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is arranged in longitudinal direction of a car body. The extruded frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is a hollow-shaped frame member made of an aluminum alloy material. A raised portion is formed at both faces of the end portions in a width direction of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The welding of the frame members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to each other is carried out using the friction stir welding method by utilizing the raised portion to supply material to the weld. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The reference numeral <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> identifies a window and the reference numeral <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> identifies a doorway. Reference numerals <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> are extruded frame members for constituting a frame of the doorway <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. The frame member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> constitutes a vertical side frame member and the frame member <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> constitutes an upper side and a lower side frame member. The extruded frame members <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> are welded to each other according to the friction stir welding method. The frame formed by the extruded frame members <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are also welded to each other according the friction stir welding method. The frame member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is a hollow-shaped frame member made of an aluminum alloy material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Raised portions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are provided at both faces at adjacent corner portions of the frame member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Further, projecting chips <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> which project toward the frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are provided. The projecting chips <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> are inserted into the hollow interior of the two plates <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the inner rib <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is deleted&mdash;or cut off to accommodate the insertion of the projecting chip <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. According to the width of the vertical side <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, an abutting face between the raised portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is provided. The construction of the frame member <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is the same as the construction of the frame member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The two plates <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are arranged substantially in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> After the frame members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> have been joined by friction stir welding, the frame members <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> are joined. Then, the frame members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> (excluding the raised portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>) are mounted on the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Along the frame members <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and to end portions of the frame members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the welding of the pads is carried out. After that, the friction stir welding to join the panels formed by frame members <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the frame formed by frame members <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The friction stir welding is carried out on one face at a time or is carried out simultaneously on both faces. After the friction stir welding, the remnants of the raised portions on the outer side of the railway vehicle and the remnants of the welding pads are cut off, and then the outer side of the railway vehicle is formed smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The above-stated embodiment according to the present invention can be applied to a case in which the frame of a window is installed using the friction stir welding method. Further, in the above stated embodiment, a hollow-shaped frame member is adopted, but the frame member shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be used instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the above stated embodiment according to the present invention, when members having a different thickness at the end thereof are abutted, such as might occur as a result of a manufacturing error, so that the height of the surface of the welding portion is not uniform, the use of welding pads may be employed for the member at the low side, after which the friction stir welding can be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Further, the indication that &ldquo;the height of the surface of the welding portion is not uniform&rdquo; refers to a case in which it is assumed that the surface portion on one side of the welding line is higher than the other, for example; however, when the rotary tool is standard, for example, it means that the distance from the rotary tool to the surface on either side of the welding line differs. The reference to &ldquo;the member at the low side&rdquo; indicates a member which is at a greater distance from the rotary tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> substantially corresponds to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, both the rib <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> of the end portion of the hollow frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the end portion of the plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the inner side of the car body are cut off and removed. An end portion of an outer side of an extruded frame member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is abutted to the plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. To this end portion of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a raised portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is provided, and this raised portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is projected toward the outer side of the car body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> An outer face of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, excluding the raised portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the outer face of the plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> are arranged to be substantially in the same plane. A projection chip <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of a face on the inner side of the car body on the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is overlapped on the plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The extruded frame member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is not a hollow-shaped frame member, but is solid to provide increased strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the solid extruded frame member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has been mounted on the stand <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in engagement with the frame member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the abutted portion between the plate <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is subjected to friction stir welding from an upper position. The friction stir welding method is carried out using the raised portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to provide material for the weld. Next, the structural body is turned over, and then the projection chip <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are fillet welded using arc welding. Further, in a case where there is no projection chip <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the abutted portion between the plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the extruded frame member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is welded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The technical scope of the present invention is not limited to the description provided in this specification, but can cover a range in which a man of ordinary skill in this field easily understand from the description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, in the case where the height of the surfaces of two members at welding portion differs, a good welding of the two members can be obtained. </paragraph>
