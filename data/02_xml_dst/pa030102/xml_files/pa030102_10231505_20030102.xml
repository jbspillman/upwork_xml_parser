<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to non-volatile digital memory, and more particularly, to FLASH EPROM memory technology incorporating floating gates having reduced lateral dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> FLASH EPROM memory is a class of non-volatile storage integrated circuits. In general, FLASH EPROMS have the capability of electrically erasing, programming, or reading a memory cell on a chip. Generally, a FLASH EPROM includes a floating gate and a control gate which form an electrical connection. A FLASH EPROM operates by charging or discharging electrons in the floating gate of the memory cell in a capacitative manner. The floating gate is formed of a conductive material, typically made of polysilicon, which is insulated from the channel of the transistor by a layer of oxide or other insulating material, and insulated from the control gate or word-line of the transistor by a second layer of insulating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The act of charging the floating gate is termed a &ldquo;program&rdquo; step for a FLASH EPROM. The program step may be accomplished through so-called hot electron injection by establishing a large positive voltage between the control gate and the source. The act of discharging the floating gate is called the &ldquo;erase&rdquo; function for a FLASH EPROM. The erase function is typically carried out by an F-N tunneling mechanism between the floating gate and the source of the transistor (source erase) or between the floating gate and the substrate (channel erase). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Due to increasing memory demands, a need exists to further reduce the size of memory devices, such as FLASH EPROMs. Reducing the cell size of memory devices increases performance and reduces power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Several devices have been developed with reduced cell size. One such device is described in &ldquo;A Low Voltage Operating Flash Memory Cell with High Coupling Ratio Using Horned Floating Gate with Fine HSG,&rdquo; by Kitamura et al., 1998 <highlight><italic>Symposium on VLSI Technology Digest of Technical Papers. </italic></highlight>Another example of a memory device with reduced cell size is described in &ldquo;A 0.24-&mgr;m Cell Process With 0.18-&mgr;m Width Isolation and 3D Interpoly Dielectric Films for 1-GB Flash Memories&rdquo; by Kobayashi et al., <highlight><italic>IEEE </italic></highlight>97-275 (1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Reducing the size of a memory cell has lead to memory cells with certain disadvantages including overbearing floating gates, or intermediate structures formed during the manufacturing of the floating gate, which degrade the tunnel oxide layer. The formation of sharp corners on the floating gate also leads to charge leakage. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to methods for fabricating a floating gate according to this invention. According to one embodiment, the method comprises forming a floating gate comprising a polysilicon layer over a substrate; providing oxide layers on opposing sides of the floating gate which have a vertical thickness that is greater than a vertical thickness of the floating gate; forming a spacer layer over the oxide layers and the floating gate; removing a portion of the spacer layer such that a top surface of the floating gate positioned laterally towards a middle region of the floating gate is exposed; and removing a portion of the floating gate underlying the exposed top surfaces of the middle region to form the contoured floating gate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In regard to each of the embodiments for methods, the floating gate may be formed to have a vertical thickness at a middle region that is less than a vertical thickness of the floating gate at the end regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As will be described in greater detail below, use of the floating gate of the present invention provides significant advantages in that a smaller memory cell is provided with comparable performance to other FLASH EPROM memory cells know in the art which have larger dimensions. Among other advantages, the memory cell of the present invention is inexpensive to manufacture, and avoids leakage of electrical charge from the floating gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates memory cells according to the invention aligned in a column to form a memory array or FLASH EPROM device. The memory cells in the column share a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The particular design or formation of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be varied depending on the memory device architecture. For example, for the source-drain-source configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include an n-type well <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> formed in a p-type substrate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Within the substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a drain junction is formed by buried p-type drain diffusion region <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and buried drain pocket <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. A source junction is formed by buried p-type source diffusion region <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and p-type buried source pocket <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Alternative semiconductor substrates may also be employed with this invention, including using an n-type substrate with a p-type well and n-type diffusion regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is positioned over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, between the source <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and drain <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> regions. A dielectric isolation layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is positioned between the floating gates <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the substrate. In a preferred embodiment, the dielectric layer is a tunnel oxide structure. The floating gates <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are spaced-apart, with oxide structures <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> disposed over an oxide region <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and preferably on the tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the floating gates <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are positioned over a floating gate region <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and preferably on the tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> extends laterally in a word line direction. Additional floating gates that comprise the FLASH EPROM of this invention may extend into the paper in a bit-line direction and are not shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Each floating gate includes a top coupling surface extending the width of the floating gate. A control gate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is formed over the floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to which the floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is electrically or capacitively coupled. The control gate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may extend over adjacent oxide structures <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Another dielectric layer may be disposed between the control gate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the floating gates <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the dielectric layer is an oxide-nitride-oxide layer (ONO) <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and the control gate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is formed from a second layer of polysilicon <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> combined with a tungsten-silicon (WSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>) layer <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from a uniform polysilicon body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The design of floating gates used in the present invention will now be described in greater detail. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of a floating gate according to the present invention. As illustrated, the floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be divided into five regions moving left to right: a first end region <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a first sloped region <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a middle region <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, a second sloped region <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and a second end region <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the thickness of the floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> varies between these different regions to create a top coupling surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> with a contoured topography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the contoured topography, the first and second end regions form raised first and second end surfaces <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The floating gate at the middle region <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is vertically thinner than the end regions and thus forms a recessed middle surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The raised end surfaces <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> may be aligned over the floating gate region <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and preferably over the first and second end regions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The diffusion regions are preferably positioned at the oxide regions <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> adjacent to the first and second end regions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the raised end surfaces <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> form plateaus that are parallel to the substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The raised end surfaces <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> are preferably substantially perpendicular to first and second sides <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The floating gate at the first and second sloped regions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> has a vertical thickness which varies between the thickness of the first or second end region and the thickness of the middle region. These regions form first and second sloped surfaces <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> that extend from the first and second end surfaces <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> respectively to the middle surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>&prime;. It is noted that when the first and second sloped surfaces <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> are perpendicular to the substrate, the first and second sloped regions are very narrow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the sloped surfaces <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> are substantially planar as they extend from the first and second end surfaces <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to the middle surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The middle surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is preferably substantially parallel to the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the middle surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>&prime; may be recessed to different depths relative to the raised end surfaces <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. As a result, the angle of the sloped surfaces <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> relative to a line <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight> extending perpendicular from the substrate may be varied. For example, as illustrated in an embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the middle surface <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is not very deep. In this instance, the sloped surfaces <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> are at an angle greater than 45 degrees relative to the perpendicular. As illustrated in another embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the middle surface <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> may be recessed deeper relative to the raised end surfaces <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the sloped surfaces <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> are at an angle less than 45 degrees relative to the perpendicular. In a preferred embodiment, the angle of the sloped middle borders is between 45 and 90 degrees. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, when the first and second sloped surfaces <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> are perpendicular to the substrate, the first and second sloped regions are very narrow. The manufacturing process for positioning the middle surface <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> will be described further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The width of the floating gate is preferably between about 2,000 and 10,000 Angstroms. The first and second end regions preferably have a thickness between about 1,000 and 9,000 Angstroms. When the floating gate includes both a first and second end region, the first and second end regions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> are preferably separated from each other by 0.4 microns and alternatively by 0.2 microns. The tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is preferably between about 50 and 120 Angstroms in thickness. The floating gate poly <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is preferably between 2,000 and 10,000 Angstroms thick. Further details, variations, and alternatives to the embodiments mentioned above will be made clearer in the discussion below, detailed a process flow for this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>I illustrate an embodiment of a process for fabricating a memory cell according to the present invention, and more specifically, an array of floating gates. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> relatively thin tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is grown over a substrate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment such as the one shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the substrate includes a p-type substrate <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and an n-type well <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. Next, a conductive layer for forming a floating gate such as a polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is deposited over the tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, followed by a masking layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The masking layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is preferably Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and serves to create an alignment structure for a second masking layer or spacer layer deposited on the substrate at an intermediate manufacturing step (illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference>). In view of the high etching selectivity between Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and polysilicon, use of Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>allows the masking layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to be etched away from the memory cell structure without requiring a stop layer to protect the polysilicon layer. Alternative materials to Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>for the masking layer include polysilicon film. However, using polysilicon film as the masking layer requires using a liner film over the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to provide a stop layer for when the masking layer is eventually removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and masking layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> are etched away to form a pattern of columns <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. In this step, dopants are used to create diffusion regions <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> between the columns <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. This may be accomplished using conventional ion implantation methods, although chemical or other similar processes may also be employed. Preferable, a p-type dopant is employed to create the diffusion regions, such as arsenic (As) is implanted into the substrate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Other suitable dopants include phosphorous (P). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, oxide structures <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are deposited between the columns <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, so that each column is abutted by an oxide structure. Each oxide structure <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is preferably resistant to etch attacks from subsequent etching of either the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> or masking layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> described in the subsequent steps. The oxide structure <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> serves to insulate the polysilicon layers <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, while providing an etch stop layer in the word-line direction. By insulated the polysilicon layers <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, the oxide structures <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> prevent leakage of electrons from the floating gate, as well as from the diffusion regions of the substrates. In addition, the oxide structures <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> decrease the drain coupling ratio (DCR), thereby increasing the coupling ratio of the memory cell. The vertical thickness of each oxide structure <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is preferably on the order of 1500 Angstroms. After the oxide structures <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> are deposited, a topology comprising the oxide structures and the columns <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is planarized by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Alternatively, the top surface may be planarized by using an etch back process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>D, the masking layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is then removed to create a step topography between the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and the oxide structure <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, as shown by cavities <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight>. The step topography forms a self-alignment structure for an oxide spacer to be subsequently deposited in a subsequent step. The polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> may then be referenced with respect to lateral ends <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight> that abut or are adjacent to the oxide structures <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, end regions <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> adjacent to the lateral ends, and a middle region <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> between the end regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference> shows that a spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is deposited over the step topography comprising the columns <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and the oxide structures <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is a chemical vapor deposited (CVD) oxide formed from SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or alternatively Si<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>. Alternatively, the spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> may be a high density plasma oxide, a film deposited by decomposition of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) or other similarly formed oxides such as SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>oxides. More generally, spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> may be an etchable material having high selectively with the underlying polysilicon layer, such as Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. In one embodiment, the thickness of the spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> ranges in general between 500-4000 Angstroms over the oxide structures <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>F, the spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is etched back to selectively remove all of the spacer layer on top of the oxide structures <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the etching method employed has high selectivity to the spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> so that the spacer layer may be etched away from the oxide structure <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> without removal of the adjacent polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> has a selectivity ratio with the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of approximately 40:1. The spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> bordering the cavities <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> is also partially removed during the etch back so that remaining spacer layers <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> at the end regions form sidewalls <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>. The sidewalls <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> extend vertically from the top of the column <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> along a vertical surface <highlight><bold>485</bold></highlight> formed by the oxide structure <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> abutting the column. A polysilicon surface <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> may be exposed between the sidewalls <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>. Etching the spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> as described in this paragraph allows the resulting topography at this intermediate step to be relatively flat at the oxide structure <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> and, if so desired, at the polysilicon surface <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> exposed between the oxide structures. As will be further described for this preferred embodiment, the width of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> in the word-line direction corresponds or correlates to the width of the raised end surfaces <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for the floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Therefore, the width of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> may be set during the manufacturing process to also form the eventual slope or wordline length of the middle surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and/or middle border <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As such, the width of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> implement a desired coupling ratio for the memory cell formed by this process. In order to maximize the coupling surface of the floating gate, the width of the sidewalls is less than 0.4 &mgr;m, preferably, and may still be smaller depending on the needs of the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G, a</cross-reference> portion of the floating gate formed by the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is removed to form a new top surface to the middle region. Preferably, this is accomplished by etching back the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to form a new polysilicon exposed surface <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight>&prime;. Due to the high selectivity between the material chosen for the spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, the spacer oxide sidewalls <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> are not affected by further etching between the sidewalls <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>. Use of the spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> provides another advantage to this invention during the etch outlined in this and the preceding step, in that the spacer layer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> maintains the planarity of top surfaces of end regions, <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> corresponding to raised end surfaces <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this way, raised end surfaces <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> formed during this step avoid sharp peaks and corners present in prior art memory devices employing floating gates with reduced lateral dimensions. Elimination of sharp peaks and corners reduce the leakage and electron instability associated with peaks and corners of the floating gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>H, the oxide structure <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is dipped back to shorten the top surface of the oxide structure and to form a contoured top or coupling surface <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> on top of the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the oxide structure <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is dipped back by a buffer oxide etch dip having a selectivity ratio between 10:1 and 50:1, with a particular preferred embodiment having a selectivity ratio of 40:1. In a preferred embodiment, the resulting coupling surface <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> formed by this process is shaped to provide the raised end surfaces <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this manner, a preferred fabrication process may be used to fabricate a floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, where the recessed middle surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and raised ends <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> combine to provide additional surface area to the coupling surface to increase the coupling ratio between the floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the control gate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>I, dielectric layer <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is deposited over the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and the oxide layer <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) layer. In a preferred embodiment, the ONO layer comprises a high temperature oxide deposited by CVD, a CVD nitride and another high temperature oxide deposited by CVD. In this preferred embodiment, the thickness of the first oxide layer is 62 Angstroms, the thickness of the nitride layer is 62 Angstroms, and the thickness of the bottom oxide layer is 45 Angstroms. The deposition of the second dielectric layer is followed by deposition of a second polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>, and WSI<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>, which combine to form the control gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> To complete the memory device, conventional flash memory fabrication steps are performed. In a preferred embodiment, the resulting memory array includes a bit-line pitch of 0.95&mgr;m, and a word-line pitch of 0.4 &mgr;m. In variations of the present invention, individual cell sizes may be further reduced in dimensions by reducing the pitch between individual memory cells. For example, the oxide structures <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) may be clipped in the word-line direction to provide an open region on top of the tunnel oxide layer for receiving boron phosphosilicate glass (BSPG), as disclosed in &ldquo;A 0.24-&mgr;m Cell Process With 0.18-&mgr;m Width Isolation and 3D Interpoly Dielectric Films for 1-GB Flash Memories&rdquo; by Kobayashi et al., and incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a memory device architecture within which the memory cells of the present invention may be used. As illustrated, two-dimensional array of memory cells is formed by arranging floating gate transistors into rows and columns. A right column comprises transistors <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. A left column comprises transistors <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The first row of the array comprises transistors <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The second row of the array comprises transistors <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. The sources of transistors are connected to buried bit-line <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. The drain of transistors <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> are connected to buried bit-line <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. The gates of transistors <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are connected to word-line <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. The gates of the transistors <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> are connected to word-line <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> An X-Y addressing system is affected by word-line <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the rows of memory cells that select on an X-axis and the bit-lines <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> and the columns of memory cells on a Y-axis. When a memory cell such as <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is addressed, appropriate voltages must be passed on to its drain and source by the bit-lines <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, respectively, and to its control gate via word-line <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. In this manner, any cell in the array may be addressed individually for programming, erasure, and read operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Alternative memory array device architectures may also be used with this invention. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,696,019 to Chang, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a memory device architecture suitable with this invention comprising a plurality of columns of memory cells sharing one or more bit lines. The architecture is based on a source-drain cell configuration in which each column of cells has a single buried diffusion local source line. An isolation structure such as a trench oxide is positioned between each column of cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Memory cells of the present invention may be programmed by providing a positive voltage to the control gate and a negative voltage to the buried drain diffusion, while the buried p-type source diffusion is allowed to float. Under these conditions, electrons may tunnel from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving free holes in the valance bands. The positive voltage at the control gate attracts electrons towards the floating gate. The electrons are accelerated in the strong vertical electrical field between the drain diffusion and the control gate and a number of them become &ldquo;hot&rdquo; electrons with sufficient energy to be injected through a tunneling dielectric layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) into the floating gate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Erasure is accomplished by F-N tunneling from the floating gate to the buried p-type source diffusion region. During erasure, a negative voltage is applied to the control gate, a positive voltage is applied to the source diffusion, and the drain is floating. Under these conditions, a forward bias will be imposed on the source diffusion and the n-well so that the n-well is positively charged. As a result, F-N tunneling erasure of electrons from the floating gate to a channel will take place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Reading is accomplished by providing a negative voltage to the drain diffusion and a negative voltage to the control gate, with the source at 0 volts. When the floating gate is charged, the threshold voltage for causing the p-channel transistor to conduct is decreased below the voltage applied to the control gate during a read operation. Thus a charged transistor will conduct during a read operation and an uncharged transistor will not conduct. The non-conducting state of the cell can be interpreted as a binary 1 or 0 depending on the polarity of the sensing circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The voltages required for programming, erasing, and/or reading operations depends in part on a coupling ratio between the floating gate and the control gate of the memory cell. The voltage across the floating gate may be characterized by the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>FG</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>CG</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&lsqb;C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>CR</subscript></highlight>(<highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>CR</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>K</subscript></highlight>)&rsqb;</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the above equation, C<highlight><subscript>CR </subscript></highlight>is the capacitive couple ratio between the floating gate and the control gate. The factor C<highlight><subscript>K </subscript></highlight>represents the capacitive coupling of the floating gate across the tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> for programming, erasing, or reading. As the above equation shows, the higher the coupling ratio between the floating gate and the control gate, the more equal the voltage across the floating gate is compared to the voltage across the control gate. As such, increasing the coupling ratio between the floating gate and the control gate decreases the voltage required to effectuate programming, erasing, or reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Some memory devices of the known art provide the floating gate with a greater coupling surface in order to increase the coupling ratio between the floating gate and the control gate. This has previously been accomplished by enlarging the lateral dimensions of the floating gate on the substrate. As such, the floating gates of the known art occupy a significant percentage of the real estate allocated on the memory array device. By contrast, this invention provides a comparable floating gate but having reduced lateral dimensions. More specifically, this invention provides for a floating gate having reduced later dimensions but which maintains or increases the coupling ratio between the floating gate and the control gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously, many modifications and variations will be apparent to practitioners skilled in this art.
