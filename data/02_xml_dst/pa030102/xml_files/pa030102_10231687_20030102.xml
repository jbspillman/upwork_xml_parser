<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit technology, including dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) and electrically erasable and programmable read only memories (EEPROMS), and particularly to a floating gate transistor memory that is dynamically electrically alterable and programmable, and methods of fabrication and use. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) are data storage devices that store data as charge on a storage capacitor. A DRAM typically includes an array of memory cells. Each memory cell includes a storage capacitor and an access transistor for transferring charge to and from the storage capacitor. Each memory cell is addressed by a word line and accessed by a bit line. The word line controls the access transistor such that the access transistor controllably couples and decouples the storage capacitor to and from the bit line for writing and reading data to and from the memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The storage capacitor must have a capacitance that is large enough to retain a charge sufficient to withstand the effects of parasitic capacitances, noise due to circuit operation, and access transistor reverse-bias junction leakage currents between periodic data refreshes. Such effects can result in erroneous data. Obtaining a large capacitance typically requires a storage capacitor having a large area. However, a major goal in DRAM design is to minimize the area of a DRAM memory cell to allow cells to be more densely packed on an integrated circuit die so that more data can be stored on smaller integrated circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In achieving the goal of increasing DRAM array capacity by increasing cell density, the sufficient capacitance levels of the DRAM storage capacitors must be maintained. A &ldquo;stacked storage cell&rdquo; design can increase the cell density to some degree. In this technique, two or more capacitor conductive plate layers, such as polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon or poly), are deposited over a memory cell access transistor on a semiconductor wafer. A high dielectric constant material is sandwiched between these capacitor plate layers. Such a capacitor structure is known as a stacked capacitor cell (STC) because the storage capacitor plates are stacked on top of the access transistor. However, formation of stacked capacitors typically requires complicated process steps. Stacked capacitors also typically increase topographical features of the integrated circuit die, making subsequent lithography and processing, such as for interconnection formation, more difficult. Alternatively, storage capacitors can be formed in deep trenches in the semiconductor substrate, but such trench storage capacitors also require additional process complexity. There is a need in the art to further increase memory storage density without adding process complexity or additional topography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Electrically erasable and programmable read only memories (EEPROMs) provide nonvolatile data storage. EEPROM memory cells typically use field-effect transistors (FETs) having an electrically isolated (floating) gate that affects conduction between source and drain regions of the FET. A gate dielectric is interposed between the floating gate and an underlying channel region between source and drain regions. A control gate is provided adjacent to the floating gate, separated therefrom by an intergate dielectric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In such memory cells, data is represented by charge stored on the polysilicon floating gates, such as by hot electron injection or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling during a write operation. Fowler-Nordheim tunneling is typically used to remove charge from the polysilicon floating gate during an erase operation. However, the relatively large electron affinity of the polysilicon floating gate presents a relatively large tunneling barrier energy at its interface with the underlying gate dielectric. The large tunneling barrier energy provides longer data retention times than realistically needed. For example, a data charge retention time at 85&deg; C. is estimated to be in millions of years for some floating gate memory devices. The large tunneling barrier energy also increases the voltages and time needed to store and remove charge to and from the polysilicon floating gate. &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; EEPROMs, which have an architecture that allows the simultaneous erasure of many floating gate transistor memory cells, require even longer erasure times to accomplish this simultaneous erasure. The large erasure voltages needed can result in hole injection into the gate dielectric. This can cause erratic overerasure, damage to the gate dielectric, and introduction of trapping states in the gate dielectric. The high electric fields that result from the large erasure voltages can also result in reliability problems, leading to device failure. There is a need in the art to obtain floating gate transistors that allow the use of lower programming and erasure voltages and shorter programming and erasure times. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes a memory cell that allows the use of lower programming and erasure voltages and shorter programming and erasure times by providing a storage electrode for storing charge and providing an adjacent insulator having a barrier energy with the storage electrode of less than approximately 3.3 eV. According to one aspect of the invention, the barrier energy can be established at a predetermined value by selecting various materials for the storage electrode and the insulator, such as to obtain a desired data charge retention time, an erase time, or an erase voltage. In one embodiment, the insulator has a larger electron affinity than silicon dioxide. In another embodiment, the storage electrode has a smaller electron affinity than polycrystalline silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the memory cell includes a floating gate transistor, having a barrier energy between the floating gate and an insulator of less than approximately 3.3 eV, such as obtained by selecting the materials of the floating gate and the insulator. According to another aspect of the present invention, the transistor is adapted for dynamic refreshing of charge stored on the floating gate. A refresh circuit allows dynamic refreshing of charge stored on the floating gate. The barrier energy can be lowered to a desired value by selecting the appropriate material composition of the floating gate. As a result, lower programming and erasure voltages and shorter programming and erasure times are obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention provides a method of using a floating gate transistor having a barrier energy of less than approximately 3.3 eV at an interface between a floating gate electrode and an adjacent insulator. Data is stored by changing the charge of the floating gate. Data is refreshed based on a data charge retention time established by the barrier energy. Data is read by detecting a conductance between a source and a drain. The large transconductance gain of the memory cell of the present invention provides a more easily detected signal and reduces the required data storage capacitance value and memory cell size when compared to a conventional dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention also includes a method of forming a floating gate transistor. Source and drain regions are formed. Materials are selected for a floating gate and a gate insulator such that a barrier energy at an interface therebetween is less than approximately 3.3 eV. A gate insulator is formed from the gate insulator material. A floating gate is formed from the gate material, such that the floating gate is isolated from conductors and semiconductors. According to one aspect of the present invention, the floating gate and gate insulator materials are selected based on a desired data charge retention time. If the charge stored on the floating gate is refreshed, the floating gate and gate insulator materials can be selected to obtain a relatively short data charge retention time, thereby obtaining the advantages of shorter write/programming and erase times. The shorter write/programming and erase times make operation of the present memory speed competitive with a DRAM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention also includes a memory device that is capable of providing short programming and erase times, low programming and erase voltages, and lower electric fields in the memory cell for improved reliability. The memory device includes a plurality of memory cells. Each memory cell includes a transistor. Each transistor includes a source region, a drain region, a channel region between the source and drain regions, and a floating gate that is separated from the channel region by an insulator. An interfacial barrier energy between the floating gate and the insulator is less than approximately 3.3 eV. The transistor also includes a control gate located adjacent to the floating gate and separated therefrom by an intergate dielectric. The memory device includes flash electrically erasable and programmable read only memory (EEPROM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and dynamically electrically alterable and programmable read only memory (DEAPROM) embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The memory cell of the present invention, having a barrier energy between the floating electrode and the insulator that is lower than the barrier energy between polysilicon and SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, provides large transconductance gain, an easily detected signal, and reduces the required data storage capacitance value and memory cell size. The lower barrier energy increases tunneling current and also advantageously reduces the voltage required for writing and erasing the floating gate transistor memory cells. For example, conventional polysilicon floating gate transistors typically require complicated and noisy on-chip charge pump circuits to generate the large erasure voltage, which typically far exceeds other voltages required on the integrated circuit. The present invention allows the use of lower erasure voltages that are more easily provided by simpler on-chip circuits. Reducing the erasure voltage also lowers the electric fields, minimizing reliability problems that can lead to device failure, and better accommodating downward scaling of device dimensions. Alternatively, the thickness of the gate insulator can be increased from the typical thickness of a silicon dioxide gate insulator to improve reliability or simplify processing, since the lower barrier energy allows easier transport of charge across the gate insulator by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, the shorter retention time of data charges on the floating electrode, resulting from the smaller barrier energy, is accommodated by refreshing the data charges on the floating electrode. By decreasing the data charge retention time and periodically refreshing the data, the write and erase operations can be several orders of magnitude faster. In this respect, the memory operates similar to a memory cell in DRAM, but avoids the process complexity, additional space needed, and other limitations of forming stacked or trench DRAM capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The memory cell of the present invention can be made smaller than a conventional DRAM memory cell. Moreover, because the storage capacitor of the present invention is integrally formed as part of the transistor, rather than requiring complex and costly non-CMOS stacked and trench capacitor process steps, the memory of the present invention should be cheaper to fabricate than DRAM memory cells, and should more easily scale downward as CMOS technology advances. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings, like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The terms wafer and substrate used in the following description include any semiconductor-based structure having an exposed surface with which to form the integrated circuit structure of the invention. Wafer and substrate are used interchangeably to refer to semiconductor structures during processing, and may include other layers that have been fabricated thereupon. Both wafer and substrate include doped and undoped semiconductors, epitaxial semiconductor layers supported by a base semiconductor or insulator, as well as other semiconductor structures well known to one skilled in the art. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention discloses a dynamic electrically alterable programmable read only memory (DEAPROM) cell. The memory cell has a floating electrode, which is defined as an electrode that is &ldquo;electrically isolated&rdquo; from conductors and semiconductors by an insulator such that charge storage upon and removal from the floating electrode depends upon charge conduction through the insulator. In one embodiment, described below, the floating electrode is a floating gate electrode in a floating gate field-effect transistor, such as used in flash electrically erasable and programmable read only memories (EEPROMs). However, a capacitor or any other structure having a floating electrode and adjacent insulator could also be used according to the techniques of the present invention described below. According to one aspect of the present invention, a barrier energy between the floating electrode and the insulator is lower than the barrier energy between polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) and silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), which is approximately 3.3 eV. According to another aspect of the present invention, the shorter retention time of data charges on the floating electrode, resulting from the smaller barrier energy, is accommodated by refreshing the data charges on the floating electrode. In this respect, the memory operates similar to a memory cell in a dynamic random access memory (DRAM). These and other aspects of the present invention are described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a simplified schematic/block diagram illustrating generally one embodiment of a memory <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to one aspect of the present invention, in which reduced barrier energy floating electrode memory cells are incorporated. Memory <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is referred to as a dynamic electrically alterable programmable read only memory (DEAPROM) in this application, but it is understood that memory <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> possesses certain characteristics that are similar to DRAMs and flash EEPROMs, as explained below. For a general description of how a flash EEPROM operates, see B. Dipert et al., &ldquo;Flash Memory Goes Mainstream,&rdquo; IEEE Spectrum, pp. 48-52 (Oct. 1993), which is incorporated herein by reference. Memory <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a memory array <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of multiple memory cells <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Row decoder <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and column decoder <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> decode addresses provided on address lines <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to access the addressed memory cells in memory array <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Command and control circuitry <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> controls the operation of memory <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in response to control signals received on control lines <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> from a processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> or other memory controller during read, write, refresh, and erase operations. Command and control circuitry <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a refresh circuit for periodically refreshing the data stored on floating gate transistor or other floating electrode memory cells <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Voltage control <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> provides appropriate voltages to the memory cells during read, write, refresh, and erase operations. Memory <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, has been simplified for the purpose of illustrating the present invention and is not intended to be a complete description. Only the substantial differences between DEAPROM memory <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and conventional DRAM and flash EEPROM memories are discussed below. </paragraph>

Such techniques for transporting charge carriers across an insulator, such as gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, are all enhanced by providing a smaller barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>according to the techniques of the present invention. These techniques allow increased current conduction, current conduction at lower voltages across gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and lower electric fields in gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, shorter data write and erase times, use of a thicker and more reliable gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, and other advantages explained below. </paragraph>

The smaller barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>also reduces the distance that electrons have to traverse, such as by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, to be stored upon or removed from floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>.

Even a small reduction in the tunneling distance results in a large increase in the tunneling probability, as described below, because the tunneling probability is an exponential function of the reciprocal of the tunneling distance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Line <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> is similar to line <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> in all respects except that line <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> illustrates a floating gate FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in which gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> has a lower barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>than for line <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, or intergate insulator <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> has a higher permittivity &egr;<highlight><subscript>235 </subscript></highlight>than for line <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, or control gate <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has a larger area than floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, such as illustrated by way of example by the floating gate FET <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> in the cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the area of a capacitor formed by the control gate <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, and the intergate insulator <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> is larger than the area of a capacitor formed by the floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, the gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, and the inversion channel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> underlying gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, or in combination with the techniques illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the intergate insulator <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> can have a higher permittivity than the permittivity of silicon dioxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>can be selected to reduce the write/erase time. In one embodiment, by way of example, but not by way of limitation, the barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>is selected to obtain a write/erase time of less than or equal to 1 second, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In another embodiment, by way of example, but not by way of limitation, the barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>is selected to obtain a write/erase time of less than or equal to 1 millisecond, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Other values of write/erase time can also be obtained by selecting the appropriate value of the barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The lower barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>and increased tunneling current also advantageously reduces the voltage required for writing and erasing the floating gate transistor memory cells <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For example, conventional polysilicon floating gate transistors typically require complicated and noisy on-chip charge pump circuits to generate the large erasure voltage, which typically far exceeds other voltages required on the integrated circuit. The present invention allows the use of lower erasure voltages that are more easily provided by simpler on-chip circuits. Reducing the erasure voltage also lowers the electric fields, minimizing reliability problems that can lead to device failure, and better accommodating downward scaling of device dimensions. In one embodiment, the barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>is selected, as described above, to obtain an erase voltage of less than the 12 Volts required by typical EEPROM memory cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the thickness of the gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> can be increased from the typical thickness of a silicon dioxide gate insulator to improve reliability or simplify processing, since the lower barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>allows easier transport of charge across the gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The lower barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>also decreases the data charge retention time of the charge stored on the floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, such as from increased thermal excitation of stored charge over the lower barrier &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>. However, conventional polysilicon floating gates and adjacent SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>insulators (e.g., 90 &angst; thick) have a data charge retention time estimated in the millions of years at a temperature of 85 degrees C., and estimated in the 1000 hour range even at extremely high temperatures such as 250 degrees C. Since such long data charge retention times are longer than what is realistically needed, a shorter data charge retention time can be accommodated in order to obtain the benefits of the smaller barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>. In one embodiment of the present invention, by way of example, but not by way of limitation, the barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>is lowered to &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>&ap;1.08 eV by appropriately selecting the composition of the materials of floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, as described below. As a result, an estimated data charge retention time of approximately 40 seconds at a high temperature, such as 250 degrees C., is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, the data stored on the DEAPROM floating gate memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is periodically refreshed at an interval that is shorter than the data charge retention time. In one embodiment, for example, the data is refreshed every few seconds, such as for an embodiment having a high temperature retention time of approximately 40 seconds for &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>&ap;1.08 eV. The exact refresh rate can be experimentally determined and tailored to a particular process of fabricating the DEAPROM. By decreasing the data charge retention time and periodically refreshing the data, the write and erase operations can be several orders of magnitude faster, as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> are schematic diagrams that respectively illustrate generally a conventional DRAM memory cell and the present invention&apos;s floating gate FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> embodiment of memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, the DRAM memory cell includes an access FET <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> and stacked or trench storage capacitor <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. Data is stored as charge on storage capacitor <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> by providing a control voltage on control line <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> to activate FET <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> for conducting charge. Data line <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> provides a write voltage to conduct charge across FET <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> for storage on storage capacitor <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. Data is read by providing a control voltage on control line <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> to activate FET <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> for conducting charge from storage capacitor <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>, thereby incrementally changing a preinitialized voltage on data line <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight>. The resulting small change in voltage on data line <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> must be amplified by a sense amplifier for detection. Thus, the DRAM memory cell of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> inherently provides only a small data signal. The small data signal is difficult to detect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, the DEAPROM memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> according to the present invention includes floating gate FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, having source <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> coupled to a ground voltage or other reference potential. Data is stored as charge on floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> by providing a control voltage on control line <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> and a write voltage on data line <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight> for hot electron injection or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. This is similar to conventional EEPROM techniques, but advantageously uses the reduced voltages and/or a shorter write time of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The DEAPROM memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be smaller than the DRAM memory cell of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, allowing higher density data storage. The leakage of charge from floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> can be made less than the reverse-bias junction leakage from storage capacitor <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> of the DRAM memory cell by tailoring the barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>according to the techniques of the present invention. Also, the DEAPROM memory cell advantageously uses the large transconductance gain of the floating gate FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The conventional DRAM memory cell of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> provides no such gain; it is read by directly transferring the data charge from storage capacitor <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. By contrast, the DEAPROM memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is read by placing a read voltage on control line <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>, and detecting the current conducted through FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, such as at data line <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>. The current conducted through FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> changes significantly in the presence or absence of charge stored on floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Thus, the present invention advantageously provides an large data signal that is easy to detect, unlike the small data signal provided by the conventional DRAM memory cell of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For example, the current for floating gate FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> operating in the saturation region can be approximated by Equation 9.

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> For an illustrative example, but not by way of limitation, a minimum-sized FET having W/L&equals;1, can yield a transconductance gain of approximately 71 &mgr;A/Volt for a typical process. In this illustrative example, sufficient charge is stored on floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> to change the effective threshold voltage V<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>by approximately 1.4 Volts, thereby changing the current I<highlight><subscript>DS </subscript></highlight>by approximately 100 microamperes. This significant change in current can easily be detected, such as by sampling or integrating over a time period of approximately 10 nanoseconds, for example, to obtain a detected data charge signal of 1000 fC. Thus, the DEAPROM memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is capable of yielding a detected data charge signal that is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the typical 30 fC to 100 fC data charges typically stored on DRAM stacked or trench capacitors. Since DEAPROM memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> requires a smaller capacitance value than a conventional DRAM memory cell, DEAPROM memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be made smaller than a conventional DRAM memory cell. Moreover, because the CMOS-compatible DEAPROM storage capacitor is integrally formed as part of the transistor, rather than requiring complex and costly non-CMOS stacked and trench capacitor process steps, the DEAPROM memory of the present invention should be cheaper to fabricate than DRAM memory cells, and should more easily scale downward as CMOS technology advances. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the present invention provides a DEAPROM having a storage element including a gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> that includes an amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC). For example, one embodiment of a memory storage element having an a-SiC gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is described in Forbes et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No.______ entitled CARBURIZED SILICON GATE INSULATORS FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, filed on the same day as the present patent application, and which disclosure is herein incorporated by reference. The a-SiC inclusive gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> provides a higher electron affinity &khgr;<highlight><subscript>225 </subscript></highlight>than the approximately 0.9 eV electron affinity of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. For example, but not by way of limitation, the a-SiC inclusive gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> can provide an electron affinity &khgr;<highlight><subscript>225 </subscript></highlight>&ap;3.24 eV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> An a-SiC inclusive gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> can also be formed using other techniques. For example, in one embodiment gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> includes a hydrogenated a-SiC material synthesized by ion-implantation of C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. For example, see G. Comapagnini et al. &ldquo;Spectroscopic Characterization of Annealed Si<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>Films Synthesized by Ion Implantation,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. of Materials Research</italic></highlight>, Vol. 11, No. 9, pp. 2269-73, (1996). In another embodiment, gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> includes an a-SiC film that is deposited by laser ablation at room temperature using a pulsed laser in an ultrahigh vacuum or nitrogen environment. For example, see A. L. Yee et al. &ldquo;The Effect of Nitrogen on Pulsed Laser Deposition of Amorphous Silicon Carbide Films: Properties and Structure,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Of Materials Research</italic></highlight>, Vol. 11, No. 8, pp. 1979-86 (1996). In another embodiment, gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> includes an a-SiC film that is formed by low-energy ion-beam assisted deposition to minimize structural defects and provide better electrical characteristics in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. For example, see C. D. Tucker et al. &ldquo;Ion-beam Assisted Deposition of Nonhydrogenated a-Si:C films,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Canadian J. Of Physics</italic></highlight>, Vol. 74, No. 3-4, pp. 97-101 (1996). The ion beam can be generated by electron cyclotron resonance from an ultra high purity argon (Ar) plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> includes an a-SiC film that is synthesized at low temperature by ion beam sputtering in a reactive gas environment with concurrent ion irradiation. For example, see H. Zhang et al., &ldquo;Ion-beam Assisted Deposition of Si-Carbide Films,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Thin Solid Films</italic></highlight>, Vol. 260, No. 1, pp. 32-37 (1995). According to one technique, more than one ion beam, such as an Ar ion beam, are used. A first Ar ion beam is directed at a Si target material to provide a Si flux for forming SiC gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. A second Ar ion beam is directed at a graphite target to provide a C flux for forming SiC gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. The resulting a-SiC gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is formed by sputtering on substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> includes an SiC film that is deposited on substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> by DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature using a conductive, dense ceramic target. For example, see S. P. Baker et al. &ldquo;D-C Magnetron Sputtered Silicon Carbide,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Thin Films. Stresses and Mechanical Properties V. Symposium</italic></highlight>, pp. Xix&plus;901, 227-32 (1995). In another embodiment, gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> includes a thin a-Si<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>:H film that is formed by HF plasma ion sputtering of a fused SiC target in an Ar-H atmosphere. For example, see N. N. Svirkova et al. &ldquo;Deposition Conditions and Density-of-States Spectrum of a-Si<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>:H Films Obtained by Sputtering,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Semiconductors</italic></highlight>, Vol. 28, No. 12, pp. 1164-9 (1994). In another embodiment, radio frequency (RF) sputtering is used to produce a-SiC films. For example, see Y. Suzaki et al. &ldquo;Quantum Size Effects of a-Si(:H)/a-SiC(:H) Multilayer Films Prepared by RF Sputtering,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Of Japan Soc. Of Precision Engineering</italic></highlight>, Vol. 60, No. 3, pp. 110-18 (1996). Bandgaps of a-Si, a-SiC, a-Si:H, and a-SiC:H have been found to be 1.22 eV, 1.52 eV, 1.87 eV, and 2.2 eV respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and includes an a-SiC material. According to one technique, gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> includes a-Si<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>:H deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). For example, see I. Pereyra et al. &ldquo;Wide Gap a-S<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>:H Thin Films Obtained Under Starving Plasma Deposition Conditions,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Of Non-crvstalline Solids</italic></highlight>, Vol. <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, No. 1-2, pp. 110-118 (1995). According to another technique, mixed gases of silane and methane can be used to form a-S<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>:H gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. For example, the source gas can include silane in methane with additional dilution in hydrogen. In another embodiment, gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> includes a clean a-Si<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>material formed by hot-filament assisted CVD. For example, see A. S. Kumbhar et al. &ldquo;Growth of Clean Amorphous Silicon Carbon Alloy Films By Hot-Filament Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition Technique,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Appl. Phys. Letters</italic></highlight>, Vol. 66, No. 14, pp. 1741-3 (1995). In another embodiment, gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> includes a-SiC formed on a crystalline Si substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> by inductively coupled plasma CVD, such as at 450 degrees Celsius, which can yield a-SiC rather than epitaxially grown polycrystalline or microcrystalline SiC. The resulting a-SiC inclusive gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> can provide an electron affinity &khgr;<highlight><subscript>225</subscript></highlight>&ap;3.24 eV, which is significantly larger than the 0.9 eV electron affinity obtainable from a conventional SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gate insulator. For example, see J. H. Thomas et al. &ldquo;Plasma Etching and Surface Analysis of a-SiC:H Films Deposited by Low Temperature Plasma Enhanced Vapor Deposition,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Gas</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>phase and Surface Chemistry in Electronic Materials Processing Symposium.

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the present invention provides a DEAPROM having a memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that includes a FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having an at least partially crystalline (e.g., monocrystalline, polycrystalline, microcrystalline, nanocrystalline, or combination thereof) SiC floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. For example, one embodiment of a memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that includes a memory storage element having a polycrystalline or microcrystalline SiC floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is described in Forbes et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ entitled SILICON CARBIDE GATE TRANSISTOR AND FABRICATION PROCESS, filed on the same day as the present patent application, and which disclosure is herein incorporated by reference. The SiC floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> provides a lower electron affinity &khgr;<highlight><subscript>215</subscript></highlight>&ap;3.7 to 3.8 eV and smaller resulting barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI </subscript></highlight>than a polysilicon gate material having an electron affinity &khgr;<highlight><subscript>215</subscript></highlight>&ap;4.2 eV. For example, using a SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, a barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>&ap;2.6 to 2.7 eV is obtained using an SiC floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, as compared to a barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>&ap;3.3 eV for a conventional polysilicon floating gate material at an interface with an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is formed from a silicon carbide compound S<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, in which the material composition x is varied. One embodiment of a memory storage element having a variable SiC composition floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is described in Forbes et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ entitled TRANSISTOR WITH VARIABLE ELECTRON AFFINITY GATE AND METHODS OF FABRICATION AND USE, filed on the same day as the present patent application, and which disclosure is herein incorporated by reference. For example, but not by way of limitation, an SiC composition of about 0.75&lt;x&lt;1.0 yields an electron affinity of approximately between 1.7 eV&lt;&khgr;<highlight><subscript>215</subscript></highlight>&lt;&minus;0.4 eV. For an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, a barrier 0.8 eV&lt;&PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>&lt;&minus;1.3 eV is obtained. In one such embodiment, floating gate FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> provides a data charge retention time on the order of seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is formed by CVD of polycrystalline or microcrystalline SiC, which can be either in situ conductively doped during deposition, or conductively doped during a subsequent ion-implantation step. According to one aspect of the invention, for example, floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is formed of an SiC film that is deposited using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). The LPCVD process uses either a hot-wall reactor or a cold-wall reactor with a reactive gas, such as a mixture of Si(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and Ar. Examples of such processes are disclosed in an article by Y. Yamaguchi et al., entitled &ldquo;Properties of Heteroepitaxial 3C-SiC Films Grown by LPCVD&rdquo;, in the 8<highlight><italic>th International Conference on Solid</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>State Sensors and Actuators and Burosensors IX, Digest of Technical Papers</italic></highlight>, page 3, vol. (934&plus;1030&plus;85), pages 190-3, Vol. 2, 1995, and in an article by M. Andrieux, et al., entitled &ldquo;Interface and Adhesion of PECVD SiC Based Films on Metals&rdquo;, in supplement <highlight><italic>Le Vide Science, Technique et Applications</italic></highlight>, (France), No. 279, pages 212-214, 1996. In other embodiments, floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is formed of an SiC film that is deposited using other techniques such as, for example, enhanced CVD techniques known to those skilled in the art including low pressure rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (LP-RTCVD), or by decomposition of hexamethyl disalene using ArF excimer laser irradiation, or by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Other examples of forming SiC film floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> include reactive magnetron sputtering, DC plasma discharge, ion-beam assisted deposition, ion-beam synthesis of amorphous SiC films, laser crystallization of amorphous SiC, laser reactive ablation deposition, and epitaxial growth by vacuum anneal. The conductivity of the SiC film of floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> can be changed by ion implantation during subsequent process steps, such as during the self-aligned formation of source/drain regions for the n-channel and p-channel FETs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, patterning and etching the SiC film, together with the underlying gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, forms the resulting individual SiC floating gates <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. The SiC film is patterned using standard techniques and is etched using plasma etching, reactive ion etching (RIE) or a combination of these or other suitable methods. For example, the SiC film can be etched by RIE in a distributed cyclotron resonance reactor using a SF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>/O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas mixture using SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as a mask with a selectivity of 6.5. Such process is known in the art and is disclosed, for example, in an article by F. Lanois, entitled &ldquo;Angle Etch Control for Silicon Power Devices&rdquo;, which appeared in <highlight><italic>Applied Physics Letters</italic></highlight>, Vol 69, No. 2, pages 236-238, July 1996. Alternatively, the SiC film can be etched by RIE using the mixture SF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ar/O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. An example of such a process is disclosed in an article by N. J. Dartnell, et al., entitled &ldquo;Reactive Ion Etching of Silicon Carbide&rdquo; in <highlight><italic>Vacuum</italic></highlight>, Vol. 46, No. 4, pages 349-355, 1955. The etch rate of the SiC film can be significantly increased by using magnetron enhanced RIE. Self-aligned source <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and drain <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> regions can then be formed using conventional techniques for forming a FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having a floating (electrically isolated) gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, or in an alternate embodiment, an electrically interconnected (driven) gate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the present invention provides a DEAPROM having a memory cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> including a FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having an at least partially crystalline (e.g., monocrystalline, polycrystalline, microcrystalline, nanocrystalline, or combination thereof) gallium nitride (GaN) or gallium aluminum nitride (GaAlN) floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. For example, one embodiment of a memory storage element having a GaN or GaAlN floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is described in Forbes et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ entitled DEAPROM AND TRANSISTOR WITH GALLIUM NITRIDE OR GALLIUM ALUMINUM NITRIDE GATE, filed on the same day as the present patent application, and which disclosure is herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a composition v of a polycrystalline Ga<highlight><subscript>1-v</subscript></highlight>Al<highlight><subscript>v</subscript></highlight>-N floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is selected approximately between 0&lt;v&lt;1 to obtain a desired barrier energy, as described below. The GaAlN floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> provides a lower electron affinity than polysilicon. The GaAlN floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> electron affinity can be approximately between 0.6 eV&lt;&khgr;<highlight><subscript>215</subscript></highlight>&lt;2.7 eV as the GaAlN composition variable v is decreased from 1 to 0. See V. M. Bermudez et al. &ldquo;The Growth and Properties of Al and AIN films on GaN&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Appl. Physics</italic></highlight>, Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 110-119 (1996). As a result, the GaAlN floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> provides a smaller resulting barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>, than a polysilicon gate material having an electron affinity &khgr;<highlight><subscript>215</subscript></highlight>&ap;4.2 eV. For example, using a SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, a barrier energy approximately between &minus;0.3 eV&lt;&PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>&lt;1.8 eV is obtained using an GaAlN floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> as the GaAlN composition v varies between v&ap;1 (i.e., approximately AIN) and v&ap;0 (i.e., approximately GaN). By contrast, a conventional polysilicon floating gate material provides a barrier energy &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>GI</subscript></highlight>&ap;3.3 eV at an interface with an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is bulk silicon, although other bulk semiconductor and semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) materials could also be used for substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> such as, for example, sapphire, gallium arsenide (GaAs), GaN, AIN, and diamond. In one embodiment, gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> is SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, although other dielectric materials could also be used for gate insulator <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, as described above, such as amorphous insulating GaN (a-GaN), and amorphous insulating AIN (a-AIN). The FET <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> using a GaAlN floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> has mobility and turn-on threshold voltage (V<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>) magnitude parameters that are advantageously influenced less by charge at SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-GaAlN interface surface states than at a conventional SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-polysilicon interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is formed of a polycrystalline, microcrystalline, or nanocrystalline, GaN thin film that is CVD deposited on a thin (e.g., 500 &angst; thick) AIN buffer layer, such as by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), which advantageously yields improved crystal quality and reduced microscopic fluctuation of crystallite orientation. See e.g., V. M. Bermudez et al. &ldquo;The Growth and Properties of Al and AIN films on GaN&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Appl. Physics</italic></highlight>, Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 110-119 (1996).

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is formed from a GaN film grown in a horizontal reactor operating at atmospheric pressure. Trimethyl gallium (TMG), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and ammonia (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) are used as source gases, and hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is used as a carrier gas. The TMG, TNM, and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are mixed just before the reactor, and the mixture is fed at high velocity (e.g., 110 cm/s) to a slanted substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> through a delivery tube. The desired GaAlN composition v is obtained by controlling the concentration ratio of TMG to TMA. In one embodiment, a 500 &angst; AIN buffer layer is obtained by growth at 600 degrees Celsius at a deposition rate of 100 &angst;/minute for approximately 5 minutes, then a epitaxial crystalline or polycrystalline layer of GaN is deposited at 1000 degrees Celsius. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment plasma-enhanced molecular beam epitaxy (PEMBE) is used to form a GaN or GaAlN floating gate <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, for example, by using electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma during molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The background pressure in the MBE chamber is typically less than 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;10 </superscript></highlight>torr. Ga flux (e.g., 99.99999% pure) is supplied by a conventional Knudsen effusion cell. The semiconductor substrates <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are heated to a temperature of approximately 850 degrees Celsius, and exposed to a nitrogen plasma (e.g., 35 Watt plasma power level) to clean the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and form a thin AIN layer thereupon. The temperature is then lowered to approximately 550 degrees Celsius for growth of a thin (e.g., 300 &angst;) GaN buffer layer (e.g., using 20 Watt plasma power level for growth in a low active nitrogen overpressure environment). The temperature is then increased, such as to approximately 800 degrees Celsius, to form the remainder of the GaN or GaAlN film forming floating gate <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, such as at a deposition rate of approximately 0.22 microns/hour. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Conclusion </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a DEAPROM cell. The memory cell has a floating electrode, such as a floating gate electrode in a floating gate field-effect transistor. According to one aspect of the invention, a barrier energy between the floating electrode and the insulator is lower than the barrier energy between polysilicon and SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, which is approximately 3.3 eV. The memory cell also provides large transconductance gain, which provides a more easily detected signal and reduces the required data storage capacitance value. According to another aspect of the invention, the shorter retention time of data charges on the floating electrode, resulting from the smaller barrier energy, is accommodated by refreshing the data charges on the floating electrode. By decreasing the data charge retention time and periodically refreshing the data, the write and erase operations can be several orders of magnitude faster. In this respect, the memory operates similar to a memory cell in DRAM, but avoids the process complexity, additional space needed, and other limitations of forming stacked or trench DRAM capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the above-described embodiments can be used in combination, and any arrangement which is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiment shown. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present invention.
