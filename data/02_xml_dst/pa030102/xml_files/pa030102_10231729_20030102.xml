<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to board-on-chip and chip-on-board ball grid array, including fine ball grid array, semiconductor chip packages. The present invention more particularly relates to constructing ball grid array semiconductor chip packages that are particularly suitable for being burned-in and tested in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. The subject invention further provides stackable ball grid array semiconductor chip packages which may be used to form highly dense, low-profile microelectronic components in which the semiconductor chip, or device, is better protected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Ball grid array (BGA), including fine ball grid array (FBGA), semiconductor device packages are well known in the art. For convenience, a representative prior art BGA package is shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference>. BGA chip packages, such as exemplary chip package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, often comprise a substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such as a printed circuit board, having an elongated aperture <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> extending through the middle thereof. A semiconductor die <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device for example, is mounted on the opposite or bottom side of the substrate which is not viewable in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Semiconductor die or device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> most often will have a plurality of bond pads <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in single column or multiple columns on an active surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of semiconductor die <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The active surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of semiconductor die <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is shown facing upward and can be viewed through aperture <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided with an upwardly facing top surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, having a plurality of contact or bond pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> located along the periphery of aperture <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Circuit traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> located on or within substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> serve to electrically connect bond pads <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to respective electrically conductive, connective elements such as solder balls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The electrically conductive elements typically comprise solder balls in electrical communication with and attached to a contact pad (not shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), or can merely be a solder ball placed directly upon, or in electrical communication with, the termination point of a selected circuit trace <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Gold filled or other conductive metal-based solder balls are frequently used. Alternatively, conductive balls made of a conductive-filled epoxy material having specifically preselected conductive qualities are also frequently used. The conductive elements or balls are arranged in a grid array pattern wherein the conductive elements or solder balls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are of a preselected size or sizes and are spaced from each other at one or more preselected distances, or pitches. Hence, the term &ldquo;fine ball grid array&rdquo; (FBGA) merely refers to a particular ball grid array pattern having what are considered to be relatively small conductive elements or solder balls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> being spaced at very small distances from each other resulting in dimensionally small spacings or pitch. As generally used herein, the term &ldquo;ball grid array&rdquo; (BGA) encompasses fine ball grid arrays (FBGA) as well as ball grid arrays. Typical solder ball sizes can be approximately 0.6 mm or less and the solder balls may have a spacing or pitch of approximately 0.80 mm or less. However, the present invention is not limited with respect to a particular solder ball diameter or pitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Contact or bond pads <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on active surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of semiconductor die <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are electrically and, to an extent mechanically, attached to respective contact pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> located on active surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by way of respective bond wires <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by wire bonding methods known and practiced within the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Referring now to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, which are cross-sectional views taken along line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, bottom side or surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and nonactive side <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of die <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are denoted. Semiconductor die or device <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is attached to bottom side <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by any suitable adhesive <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an encapsulant <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> disposed over contact pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, bond wires <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and bond pads <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to protect and secure the somewhat fragile bond wires and bond sites from environmentally induced corrosion or other physical harm during immediately subsequent processing, storage, shipment, further processing, and ultimately during end use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For quality control purposes, as well as manufacturing efficiency, it is standard practice to burn-in and electrically test semiconductor chip packages, such as representative prior art chip package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, prior to installing the packages on the next-higher level of assembly, such as upon a dual in-line memory module (DIMM). Those chip packages that do not successfully undergo burn-in and testing are either reworked and retested or scrapped in accordance with economic feasibilities of the particular chip package being manufactured. In order to perform such pre-installation burn-in and testing, that is, intentionally subjecting the packages to elevated voltages and temperatures and then running preliminary, and perhaps diagnostic, tests on BGA chip packages such as BGA chip package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the chip packages must be mounted in specifically designed test tooling. A simplified illustration of representative test tooling <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Generally, each BGA chip package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed in chip-receiving cell <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of tray or holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Chip package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> usually has, but may not have, encapsulant <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> disposed thereon at the time of burn-in and testing. Upon chip package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being properly seated in tray <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, probe head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is moved toward chip package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow so as to engage each probe <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with a corresponding conductive element such as solder ball <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Upon BGA chip package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being burned-in and tested, probe head <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from the chip package and the chip package is removed from test tray or holder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and forwarded on for further processing depending on the test results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Because there are typically a large number of such solder balls to be contacted by a like number of probes for each chip package which must be arranged in a precise array or pattern in order to make electrical contact with the underlying solder balls, the test tooling is quite expensive, as well as time consuming, to construct. The time and expense factors of providing specific test tooling for each type of BGA chip having a wide variety of ball grid array patterns is compounded when the particular BGA chips to be burned-in and tested are of the fine ball grid array variety wherein the balls and spacing are quite small, thereby making the construction of the chip package test tooling even more time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the specific test tooling to be devised must not only accommodate, burn-in, and test a single chip package, but must also be able to simultaneously accommodate, burn-in, and test a significant number of other chip packages, which may or may not have been segmented from a common substrate and are usually positioned and accompanied by respective cells of test tooling so that production quantities can be produced economically. Thus, it can be appreciated that the time and expense of constructing BGA chip package test tooling, which by necessity has a multiplicity of probes specifically sized and arranged in patterns which must exactly correspond to the respective solder ball array being tested, are significant hindrances to quickly introducing BGA chip packages and, in particular, FBGA chip packages having new and different solder ball array patterns to the very competitive semiconductor chip marketplace. Furthermore, the test probes of the test tooling must be designed not to unduly damage the solder balls which will ultimately be used to electrically and mechanically connect the chip package to the next level of assembly by solder ball attachment methods used within the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,784, issued to Pai on Nov. 2, 1999, and related U.S. Pat. No. 5,831,444, issued to Pai on Nov. 3, 1998, are directed toward a method and apparatus for testing BGA chip packages wherein chip packages are placed within a self-centering test housing wherein contacts of the chip package are brought into contact with respective matching contact pads in order to burn-in and test the chip package. However, the testing apparatus of Pai must be provided with matching test contacts having the same array or pattern of the contact pads of the chip package to be tested in order to properly test the chip package. Thus, the substrate in which the test pads are located must be specifically manufactured to match the specific grid array of the chip package to be tested, giving rise to previously discussed unwanted new product lead times and expenses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,018,249 issued to Akram et al. on Jan. 25, 2000, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, provides a further example of a testing system for the testing of chip packages having external contacts or bumps arranged in a BGA or FBGA pattern. Notwithstanding the desirable features of the Akram et al. patent, the disclosed testing system includes matching contacts being provided and suitably positioned for respectively connecting with a correspondingly positioned external contact or bump on the chip package to be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,566 issued to King et al. on Oct. 14, 1997, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, is directed toward overcoming a problem in the industry wherein bare chips are continuously made increasingly smaller yet the chip-molded, plastic resin encapsulated, package-to-external circuit electrical connection typically remains at a previous, industry-set size and configuration when chips were larger. The semiconductor chip package taught by the King et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,566 is provided with a lead frame having leads that generally originate near the center of the package and extend generally laterally outwardly over the chip toward and, if desired, beyond the periphery of the encapsulating material which generally defines the chip package. The innermost region of each conductive lead is wire bonded to a respective bond pad located on the active surface of the chip. The conductive leads near the periphery of the chip are exposed for accommodating a solder ball or other conductive element on the upper surface of the package, which is ultimately to be mounted on a printed circuit board in accordance with previous industry standards. The laterally protruding outer end portions of the individual conductive leads facilitate testing of the chip as the ends can be contacted with presently used testing equipment. After testing, the protruding ends can be trimmed flush with the exterior of the plastic resin package. Alternatively, the laterally protruding outer end portions of the conductive leads may be trimmed prior to encapsulating the entire chip package with plastic resin. Although suitable for many applications, providing the separate lead frame and fully encapsulating the chip package of King et al. may unnecessarily add to the complexity and cost of manufacturing chips to be used in other applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,709, issued to Pastore et al. on Mar. 24, 1998, discloses a ball grid array semiconductor device and apparatus for testing the device. In particular, Pastore et al. disclose a chip mounted on the top surface of a substrate which has a plurality of conductive castellations positioned around the periphery of the substrate serving as redundant electrical connections that are in communication with respective bond pads on the semiconductor chip. The conductive castellations, which are disclosed as being conductive vias that have been formed in the substrate which are subsequently trimmed to define the periphery of the substrate, thereby cutting the conductive vias in half, are engaged by specifically designed test apparatus to avoid directly contacting solder balls located on the top surface of the substrate. The test apparatus includes a test socket designed to accommodate the semiconductor device having contact members to make contact with the conductive castellations located about the periphery. The disclosed test apparatus appears to have been specifically designed to accommodate the disclosed semiconductor device. Thus, it would appear that added monetary costs would be incurred upon constructing and incorporating such test apparatus, or at least the disclosed test socket, into a production line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition to the semiconductor packaging industry being driven to increase the number of solder balls or conductive contacts that is to be included within a BGA chip package of a given surface area, the industry is also being driven to reduce the overall height or profile of packaged semiconductor chips so that components and modules incorporating such chips can be made yet smaller and more compact. Thus, the industry is seeking ways in which BGA chip packages can be constructed so as to further reduce their individual height. Furthermore, the industry is seeking ways in which BGA chip packages may be stacked one upon another, which are, in turn, attached to a substrate or board to provide modules, such as dual in-line memory modules, of ever slimmer profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An example of a lead chip design in a BGA package is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,405, issued to Yamashita on Sep. 16, 1997. The Yamashita patent discloses a semiconductor device that has a lead frame attached to the semiconductor chip. Through-holes are provided in a base film that allows solder bumps to connect via the lead frame to the semiconductor device. The Yamashita patent requires several steps of attaching the semiconductor device to the lead frame, then providing sealing resin, and then adding a base film and forming through-holes in the base film. A cover resin is added before solder bumps are added in the through-holes to connect to the lead frame. Thus, the resulting structure lacks the ability to stack devices one on top of another and further requires special test tooling be provided to match the particular grid pattern of the solder bumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,566, issued to King et al. on Oct. 14, 1997, referenced earlier herein, discloses a semiconductor chip package that includes discrete conductive leads with electrical contact bond pads on a semiconductor chip. The lead assembly is encapsulated with a typical encapsulating material and the solder balls or conductive elements are formed to protrude through the encapsulating material to contact the conductive leads and make contact with an external circuit. Although the semiconductor chip has the leads wire bonded to bond pads located in the center of the die, thereby allowing the conductive leads to be more readily protected upon being encapsulated by the encapsulating material, the chip package construction of the King et al. patent lacks the ability to be stacked one upon another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> With respect to stacking semiconductor chip packages, there are various methods of stacking semiconductor devices in three-dimensional integrated circuit packages known within the art. One such design is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,221, issued to Kim et al. on Apr. 29, 1997. The Kim et al. patent discloses a semiconductor package assembly that has recessed edge portions which extend along at least one edge portion of the assembly. An upper surface lead is exposed therefrom and a top recess portion is disposed on a top surface of the assembly. A bottom recess portion is disposed on the bottom surface of the assembly, such that when the assembly is used in fabricating a stacked integrated circuit module, the recess edge portion accommodates leads belonging to an upper semiconductor assembly to provide electrical interconnection therebetween. Unfortunately, the assembly requires long lead wires from the semiconductor chip to the outer edges of the assembly. These lead wires add harmful inductance and unnecessary signal delay and can form a weak link in the electrical interconnection between the semiconductor chip and the outer edges. Further, the device profile is a sum of the height of the semiconductor chip, the printed circuit board to which it is bonded, the conductive elements, such as the solder balls, and the encapsulant that must cover the chip and any wire bonds used to connect the chip to the printed circuit board. So, reducing the overall profile is difficult because of the geometries required in having the lead pads on the semiconductor chip along the outer periphery with extended lead wires reaching from the chip to the outer edges of the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It can be appreciated that one of the favorable attributes of BGA chip packages is that the total height or overall thickness of the chip package is quite thin compared to other chip packages. Thus, BGA chip packages lend themselves to be especially suitable for incorporation within memory modules such as SDRAM modules and, in particular, dual in-line memory modules (DIMM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, what is needed within the art is a ball grid array chip package that can be easily burned-in and tested by existing test tooling. Another need within the art is for low-profile ball grid array chip packages that can be stacked so as to have a minimum amount of stack height to allow the production of low-profile dual in-line memory modules, for example. Such low-profile stackable packages would ideally have a lower profile than otherwise provided in the prior art and would ideally be producible with as few production steps as is feasible, yet provide adequate protection of the semiconductor chip during shipping and handling. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a stackable ball grid array (BGA) or fine ball grid array (FBGA) semiconductor package is disclosed which is particularly suitable for board-on-chip or chip-on-board applications in which low-profile BGA or FBGA semiconductor packages are needed due to space limitations. Such an exemplary need includes, but is not limited to, memory modules used in notebook-sized personal computers, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> BGA or FBGA semiconductor packages of the present invention generally comprise a substrate having a semiconductor device attached to a selected surface thereof. The semiconductor device has a plurality of bond pads respectively wire bonded to a plurality of bond pads located on the substrate. Preferably, the wire bonds extend through an aperture extending through the substrate. The substrate is further provided with a plurality of circuit traces leading from the substrate bond pads to a plurality of connective elements, such as solder ball contact pads and associated solder balls, which are arranged in a preselected ball grid array pattern. Additional circuit traces or continuations of the same circuit traces further extend to a plurality of test pads arranged and located on the substrate in a preselected pattern. Preferably, at least the interconnecting circuit traces electrically connecting selected substrate bond pads to intermediately positioned connective elements, preferably including solder ball contact pads and associated solder balls and, in turn, electrically connecting respective test pads are preformed on a tape which can be conveniently and efficiently attached to one or more surfaces of the substrate. Burn-in and testing of the semiconductor chip attached to the substrate is preferably performed by prior existing test tooling having test probes arranged in patterns typically used in prior known semiconductor chip packages to contact the test pads of the semiconductor chip packages of the present invention. Upon the test pads being contacted by the test probes of the test tooling, selected voltages can be applied to selected pads to burn-in and test the semiconductor device attached to the substrate. This feature is a significant improvement over prior known methods of using test probes specifically designed and arranged in the same specific ball grid array pattern that the individual connective elements or solder balls of prior known ball grid array semiconductor packages are arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Preferably, BGA/FBGA semiconductor packages embodying the present invention are provided a plurality of test pads which are arranged in a thin small outline package (TSOP) pin-out pattern because test tooling used for burning-in and testing prior known non-BGA/FBGA semiconductor packages is widely available within the industry. In addition to alleviating the time and expense required to design and construct test tooling specifically designed to contact the connective elements of a BGA semiconductor package arranged in a particular ball grid array, there is no need to contact and perhaps damage the individual connective elements or solder balls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Upon successfully burning-in and testing a BGA/FBGA semiconductor package constructed in accordance with the present invention, the test pads may be disassociated from the substrate to decrease the final surface area, or footprint of the semiconductor package, if so desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Further in accordance with the present invention, the semiconductor device and the connective elements may optionally be provided on the same surface of the substrate of the BGA/FBGA semiconductor package so as to decrease the profile of the semiconductor package. This is particularly useful when stacking and attaching a plurality of BGA/FBGA semiconductor packages on a common board used in a memory module, such as a dual in-line memory module. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> of the drawings, isolated top views of exemplary substrate tape having electrical circuit outlines preformed therein and which are to be applied to one or more exposed faces of a supporting substrate are illustrated. Tapes <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, respectively, provide a convenient and efficient method of providing circuitry on a supporting substrate in which a chip will ultimately be attached and electrically connected therewith. Each individual chip circuitry portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is preferably designed to accommodate one chip. Thus, there are multiple, identically repeating individual die portions on a given tape. Such tapes frequently include a thermosetting adhesive which will bond to a wide variety of substrates. The supporting or core substrate may be made from a wide variety of materials with epoxy-glass material such as, but not limited to, bismaleimide-triazine (BT) or FR-4 board which are both heavily favored by the industry. Alternative substrate materials include ceramic or silicon materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Individual chip circuitry portions <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of tapes <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are respectively attached to one or both sides of a complementarily configured supporting substrate which, in turn, will accommodate at least one bare chip. Such exemplary substrates, denoted as <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, respectively, may be seen in cross-section in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 9B</cross-reference> wherein individual chip circuitry portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of tape <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has been applied on top of substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and individual chip circuitry portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of tape <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has been applied on top of substrate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, tape <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes an aperture <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having bond pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> located along opposing sides of the aperture. Bond pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are selectively provided with an electrically conductive circuit trace <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that leads to a respective conductive element, solder ball, or solder ball location <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Selected conductive elements or solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are provided with a second circuit trace <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> leading to a respective test contact pad <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> located outwardly away from aperture <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Test contact pads <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are preferably arranged to fan out in what is referred to as a thin small outline package (TSOP) which is recognized as an industry standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, individual chip circuitry portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes various circuit traces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which interconnect bond pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and which further interconnect solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to peripherally located test contact pads <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Circuit traces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are able to be easily routed around any solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a somewhat serpentine fashion to circumvent one or more particular solder balls that would otherwise physically block the circuit from reaching its respective destination. This particular characteristic of being able to route circuit traces as needed around intervening solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, or alternative connective elements used in connection with or in lieu of solder balls, allows great versatility in that solder ball grid arrays having virtually any feasible number of solder balls arranged in any feasible pattern could be used and need not be restricted to the exemplary <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-column arrangement as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. It should be appreciated that although substrate tape <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides a convenient, cost-efficient method of providing the desired circuit traces and ball grid array on a selected substrate, alternative methods to apply circuit traces to a substrate can be used. For example, circuit layers including circuit traces, bond pads, solder balls, or contact elements, and/or test contact pads could be screen printed onto one or both faces of a substrate. Furthermore, multiple layers of circuit layers can be disposed upon not only the exposed surfaces of the supporting substrate but can be &ldquo;sandwiched&rdquo; or laminated within the substrate by circuit layer lamination methods known in the art if so desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Another exemplary substrate tape <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> showing an individual chip circuitry portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> having a preselected ball grid array arrangement is shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the drawings. In drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, individual chip circuitry portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> includes a <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>-ball grid array which has been laid out so as to place solder balls and/or connective elements <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> about the periphery of what is to be the chip-scale package with test contact pads <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> being further outwardly positioned opposite each other along two sides of what will be the chip package. As with test contact pads <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the tape outline shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, test contact pads <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> have been prearranged to coincide with a thin small outline package pin-out configuration. Bond pads <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> located along aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are placed in electrical communication with selected respective solder balls and/or connective elements <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> by circuit traces <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. In turn, selected solder balls <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are placed in electrical communication with test contact pads <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> through second circuit traces <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> so as to provide a continuous conductive path from a selected test contact pad <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> back to at least one selected bond pad <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Collectively referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 9B</cross-reference>, as well as drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference>, an exemplary BGA chip package constructed in accordance with the present invention is shown in cross-section in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. The process of attaching at least one semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to the bottom side of a substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, in which an individual chip circuitry portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of tape <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has been applied to at least the opposite or top side of substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, is carried out much like, if not identical to, prior known methods such as those discussed here with respect to the chip package illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference>. That is, a bare semiconductor die or device <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is attached to substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by way of a die attach adhesive <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Adhesive <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is preferably a dielectric adhesive that is nonconductive and has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is compatible with semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Adhesive <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may be formed of epoxy resin, polymer adhesives, or any other adhesive having suitable properties. Alternatively, tape having adhesive applied to both sides, such as Kapton&trade; tape, is particularly suitable for use as die attach adhesive <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Upon semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> being located and attached to substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so as to properly orient and align bond pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which are located on the active surface of semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to face upward within aperture <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, bond wires <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are provided which respectively place a selected die bond pad <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in electrical communication with a respectively appropriate bond pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> located on the opposite or upper surface of substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A top view of aperture <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, die bond pads <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> located on active surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, bond wires <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and substrate bond pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be viewed in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Returning to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, it can be seen that an encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> has been disposed in and over aperture <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to cover die bond pads <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, bond wires <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and substrate bond pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in order to provide protection against environmental contaminants, corrosives, and incidental physical contact. Applying encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> may be applied either before burn-in and testing or after burn-in and testing as deemed most appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extend a preselected height above encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to ensure that upon the final chip package being installed on the next level of assembly, encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> clears the structure in which solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are attached. As practiced within the art, solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be formed of a conductive metal such as gold or may be formed of conductive-filled epoxies having suitable and often very specific conductive properties. Alternatively, solder balls can be attached to the terminal end of a particular circuit trace <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, be attached to contact pads provided on substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in which a respective circuit trace <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> terminates, or be formed of any type of connective element which can serve in connection with or for the same purpose as a solder ball which ultimately provides electrical and mechanical attach points on the next higher level of assembly. Furthermore, it will be appreciated by those in the art that substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be provided with a multitude of conductive paths and not just the circuit traces shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. For example, a given solder ball <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or solder ball location may be in electrical communication with the opposite surface of substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by way of through-holes or may be in electrical communication with one more circuit traces that have been sandwiched or laminated within substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as known and practiced within the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> At this stage of construction, the exemplary BGA chip package as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is ready for burn-in and testing and is shown as being detached from tape <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the present invention, semicompleted chip package <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is then placed in a conventional burn-in and test apparatus which includes test tooling <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> as illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. A semicompleted BGA chip package <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is then installed in a chip package holder <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and a moveable probe head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is moved into position as shown by the downwardly pointing arrow of drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> to carefully engage test contact pads <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> located on the periphery of substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with complimentarily positioned probes <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that are preferably arranged in the same TSOP pin-out configuration as the underlying test contact pads <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. That is, there is a corresponding probe <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for each test contact pad <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that, by way of respective circuit traces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, leads to a respective substrate bond pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which, in turn, is in electrical communication with a respective die bond pad <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by way of a bond wire <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing a preselected voltage profile to be applied to initially burn-in attached semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. After burn-in, probes <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably remain in contact with their respective test contact pads <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and tests are conducted to ensure semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is fully operational. Optionally, chip package <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> need not be tested immediately after burn-in, but probes <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and probe head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> could be withdrawn from chip package <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and chip package <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> removed from chip package holder <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> to be reinstalled and tested at a later point in time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Upon a given semicompleted BGA chip package <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> being successfully burned-in and tested, the periphery of substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having test contact pads <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, as well as a large portion of circuit traces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, can be severed away, rendering a completed chip package <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> with encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> not in place, and as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> with encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> in place. Completed BGA chip package <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can either be immediately forwarded for further processing and installation to the next higher assembly or be placed in storage until ready for installation or shipment at another time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The construction, burn-in, and testing process of completed BGA chip package <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as discussed above is equally applicable to the exemplary completed BGA chip package <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>. Although completed chip packages <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> have both been shown as being trimmed so as to remove test contact pads <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> from respective chip packages <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and in the case of chip package <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, with some or most of each circuit trace <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> also having been removed to minimize the surface area or &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; of the chip packages, it may not be necessary to do so if the final surface area or &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; is not a critical factor. In other words, trimming off peripherally located test pads can be optional if the subject chip package is intended to be installed on a board or other structure where the chip package surface area or footprint is not a factor, thereby saving an unnecessary manufacturing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It should also be appreciated that the exemplary BGA chip packages being provided with test pads arranged in a conventional TSOP pin-out pattern allows for the use of existing test apparatus and test tooling in order to minimize the lead time and associated costs for introducing BGA chip packages. Test pads need not be limited to only a TSOP pattern. For example, a BGA chip package comprising virtually any number of solder balls or other connective elements arranged in any feasible pattern to meet a specified conductive/mechanical attachment pattern can be provided test pads arranged in other recognized, standard patterns in which conventional, and thus readily available, test apparatus and test tooling can be used. For example, and without limitation, a chip package in accordance with the present invention can alternatively make use of the small outline package (SOP), quad flat pack (QFP), land grid array (LGA) and other patterns in which test tooling is readily available or adaptable for testing chip packages constructed in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Referring now to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, illustrated is a side view of an exemplary BGA chip package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that is preferably constructed, burned-in, and tested in accordance with the teachings disclosed herein. However, BGA chip package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can alternatively be constructed, burned-in, and tested with prior known techniques such as those discussed in relation to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference> herein. As with the exemplary BGA chip packages illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 9</cross-reference>B, BGA chip package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes at least one semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> attached to a substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> provided with appropriate electrical traces similar to those provided by way of individual chip circuitry portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of tape <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. However, with respect to chip package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, provision must be made to allow for electrical contact to be made through the cross-section of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to allow semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to be attached to the same surface or face of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as are solder balls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and solder ball contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In other words, circuit traces <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and substrate bond pads <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are located on what is shown as being the bottom side of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> with circuit traces <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> being placed in electrical communication with the solder ball contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> located on the opposite side of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As mentioned earlier, providing circuit traces on the exposed faces of substrates or alternatively sandwiched within laminated substrates is known within the art and such can be used to provide electrical communication between solder ball contacts <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> located on the top surface of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with bond pads <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> located on the opposite or bottom side of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be provided on both sides of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to allow for stacking of chip packages one on top of the other. Also, as discussed earlier, semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is attached to substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by way of any suitable adhesive, a die attach adhesive <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. An encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is disposed over substrate bond pads, die bond pads, and associated bond wires in the same manner as discussed earlier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The primary difference between completed BGA chip package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and completed BGA chip package <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is that the semiconductor die is located on the same side of the substrate as are solder balls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Such an arrangement is particularly conducive to decreasing the profile h of the chip package as measured from encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to the far side of solder balls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Depicted in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is an alternative BGA chip package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&prime; which is essentially identical to chip package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, with the primary difference between the two chip packages being the provision of concave solder ball contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime; on at least one side and optionally on both sides or surfaces of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to allow one chip package to be stacked upon another. By providing a concave or indented surface of solder ball contact pad <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime; which accommodates an associated solder ball <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the profile of the chip package can be reduced to allow an even shorter profile h&prime; measured from encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to the far side of solder balls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. By thus reducing the profile of the chip package, a module comprising one or more stacks of such low-profile chip packages can be provided with a total stack height that will allow electronic products incorporating such a low-profile module to be reduced in size. Furthermore, such reduced-profile modules having stacks of reduced-profile chip packages will allow the art to incorporate modules having less expensive chip packages in products that previously could not accommodate such modules due to space limitations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of an exemplary &ldquo;upside-down&rdquo; stackable chip package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&prime; as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. Semiconductor die or device <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is positioned on the same side as solder balls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> with substrate bond pads <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> preferably located on the opposite surface of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or, as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, on the downwardly facing surface of the substrate. Substrate bond pads <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are placed in electrical communication with die bond pads <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by way of bond wires <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> preferably extending through aperture <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as shown and are encapsulated by encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Circuit traces <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> may optionally be located on the downwardly facing surface of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, by way of ball tape <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and individual chip circuitry portion <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, for example, and thereby extend outwardly along the downwardly facing surface of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> whereupon circuit traces <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> may then be routed through the cross-section of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or otherwise placed in electrical communication with optional conductive vias or other conductive elements <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> which extend through substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the respectively appropriate pad&apos;s connective element or solder ball contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime;, or optional concave contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime; located on the opposite or upwardly facing surface of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Optionally, electrically connecting substrate bond pads <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> with contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime; as discussed earlier, may be achieved by laminating or &ldquo;sandwiching&rdquo; circuit traces <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>&prime; within substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and routing them through substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in order to electrically connect each laminated circuit trace <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>&prime; to its respective contact pad <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or optional pad <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime;. The exemplary upside-down BGA chip package illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is shown prior to the test pads being disassociated from the chip package along substrate severing line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. As with circuit traces <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, circuit traces <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which electrically connect contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or optional pad <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime; may be disposed on the upwardly facing surface of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, or optionally may be laminated within substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as denoted by trace <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>&prime;. Upon reaching its respective test contact pad <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, circuit trace <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>&prime; may then be placed in electrical communication with its respective test contact pad. Specific methods of extending circuit traces through chip package substrates in order to be placed in electrical communication with contact pads or other connective elements are well known within the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, illustrated is a side view of a representative conventional module, such as a dual in-line memory module (DIMM) <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, wherein BGA chip packages, such as exemplary chip packages <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> disclosed herein or, alternatively, conventionally constructed chip packages such as representative chip package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, are installed in a stacked arrangement on opposite faces or surfaces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of a module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Memory module <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, as illustrated, includes surfaces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, each having a stack of two BGA chip packages, one mounted on the other, with the BGA chip package closest to module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> being secured to module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Conventional solder ball contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in connection with solder balls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> provide mechanical and electrical points of attachment and are attached by surface mounting methods widely practiced within the art. Although drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows the use of solder balls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and solder ball contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, it should be understood that other connective elements are known to be used in the art in lieu of solder balls and contact pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, dimension A is the distance between proximate substrates <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of stacked chip packages, which, in effect, includes the final height of solder ball <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and two contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Dimension A conventionally is approximately 0.5 mm or greater. Dimension B, the distance between the closest substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, is conventionally approximately 0.5 mm or greater. Dimension C, which is the total stack height of both or, alternatively, all chip packages above module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> if more than two chip packages are stacked together, is conventionally approximately 1.9 mm or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Dimension D represents the distance the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extends from chip substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and typically ranges upward from 0.3 mm. Dimension E is the distance which encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> typically extends from substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and is approximately 0.15 mm. Chip package substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a typical thickness of approximately 0.3 mm. Lastly, module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, such as those used in dual in-line memory modules, has a thickness represented by dimension G which is typically approximately 1.1 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A conventionally configured memory module such as <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, consisting of DRAM chip packages for example, has a total overall thickness H ranging between approximately 4.7 mm and approximately 5.1 mm after application of a protective cover over the module necessary to protect the exposed back sides of semiconductor dies <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> during shipping and subsequent installation in a final product. Such a total thickness of 4.7 to 5.1 mm would thus be unacceptable for use in certain applications, such as in connection with thin profile notebook-sized personal computers, as well as other products where volumetric space for memory modules is at a premium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A nonconventionally configured, reduced-profile memory module incorporating exemplary BGA chip packages <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&prime;, as illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> of the drawings. Reduced-profile BGA chip packages <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&prime;B, and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>D, respectively stacked together and mounted on opposite surfaces <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, are each configured to have a semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> attached to the same surface of substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to which solder ball <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and associated concave solder ball contact pad <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime; are attached. BGA chip packages constructed in such a nonconventional &ldquo;upside-down&rdquo; manner eliminates the need for encasing the module with a protective cover. This is attributable to the backside of each semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> being protected by virtue of being physically positioned between either an adjacent chip package within the same stack or between its respective chip substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Thus, the added thickness of a protective cover is eliminated, as well as the associated time and costs of applying such a protective cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As discussed with respect to reduced-profile or upside-down BGA chip packages <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&prime; illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 12</cross-reference>, such chip packages are preferably constructed, burned-in, and tested in accordance with the earlier-described techniques and procedures incorporating severable test contact pads arranged in conventional patterns such as TSOP pin-out patterns. However, modules such as <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>&prime; as shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> can be constructed in an &ldquo;upside-down&rdquo; manner, with or without concave solder ball pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime;, while employing prior conventional construction, burn-in, and testing techniques used in producing BGA chip packages such as representative chip package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> By incorporating reduced-profile, upside-down BGA chip packages, such as chip packages <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&prime;B, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&prime;C, and/or <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>D shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the total overall thickness H of module <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>&prime; can be reduced to approximately 4.4 to 4.6 mm. Dimension A, the distance between proximate substrates <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of stacked chip packages which, in effect, includes the final height of solder ball <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and two contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, may be maintained at approximately 0.5 mm or optionally can be reduced to approximately 0.4 mm by incorporating concave solder ball contact pad <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime;. Dimension B, the distance between the closest substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, is maintained at approximately 0.5 mm, but can be reduced to approximately 0.4 mm by use of concave solder ball contact pad <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime;. Dimension C, the total stack height of both, or alternatively all, chip packages above module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> if more than two chip packages are stacked together, has been substantially reduced to approximately 1.75 mm and may optionally be reduced to approximately 1.65 mm if extensive use of concave solder ball contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime; is incorporated where possible or eliminated altogether. Dimension D, the distance the semiconductor die <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> extends from chip substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, remains unchanged at approximately 3 mm. Dimension E is the distance which encapsulant <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> typically extends from substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is approximately 0.15 mm. Chip package substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> thickness F may remain approximately 0.3 mm. However, in certain applications, the substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> thickness can be reduced to approximately 0.25 mm if substrate production is very carefully controlled and monitored. Lastly, module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> thickness dimension G remains approximately 1.1 mm. However, dimension G is capable of being further reduced as is chip package substrate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> if manufacturing parameters and quality control are adequately addressed providing that module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> retains the requisite structural rigidity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it can now be appreciated that the exemplary memory module depicted in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> incorporates BGA chip packages where the semiconductor die is attached to the same side of the chip package substrate as are the connective elements, such as solder balls <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and solder ball contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, or optional concave solder ball contact pads <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> While the exemplary memory module as illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is shown to incorporate &ldquo;upside-down&rdquo; BGA chip packages which, in turn, incorporate solder balls and associated solder ball contact pads to allow the surface mounting of the chip packages to each other or upon the module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by processes known within the art, it is to be understood that a wide variety of materials and connective structures can be used in lieu of solder balls and/or solder ball contact pads as shown. Furthermore, it should also be understood that, depending on the particular type of circuitry provided on or within chip package substrates <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as well as on or within module board <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, it is possible to eliminate the use of solder ball contact pads entirely and instead place a respective connective element, such as solder ball <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, in direct electrical communication with the appropriate circuitry or element that is serving the same function as a solder ball contact pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Referring now to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> schematic of an electronic system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, such as, but not limited to, a notebook-sized personal computer, including an input device <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and an output device <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> coupled or otherwise in electrical communication with a processor device <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, is illustrated. Processor device <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is also coupled or otherwise in electrical communication with a memory device <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> incorporating stackable chip packages such as <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&prime;, memory modules <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>&prime; or embodiments and variations thereof, as well as modules or embodiments and variations thereof, incorporating stacks of chip packages embodying the teachings disclosed within the specification and drawings. Furthermore, processor device <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may be directly embodied in a module embodying the teachings hereof and include, without limitation, a microprocessor, a first level cache memory, and additional integrated circuits, such as a video processor, an audio processor, or a memory management processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Having thus described and illustrated exemplary chip packages and modules embodying the invention, it will be understood that a multitude of changes, adaptations, revisions, additions, and deletions may be made to the invention without departing from the scope of the invention. Furthermore, such may be required by the design of the semiconductor device and its attachment to the chip package substrate and/or the design of the chip package and its attachment to other chip packages, modules, accommodating assemblies, or adjacent assemblies of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
