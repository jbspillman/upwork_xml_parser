The invention is also directed to a method of operating such a system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts an evaporatively-cooled, direct-expansion refrigeration system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of conventional design. The refrigeration system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a compressor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a condenser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an evaporative subcooler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, an expansion device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and an evaporator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The compressor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, condenser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, evaporative subcooler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, expansion device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and evaporator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are interconnected by piping <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A refrigerant, e.g., halocarbon, enters the compressor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as superheated vapor (see arrow <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The compressor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> raises the pressure and temperature of the superheated refrigerant. The high-pressure, superheated refrigerant is circulated to the condenser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by way of the piping <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (arrow <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). The refrigerant is cooled and condensed to saturated liquid in the condenser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In particular, thermal energy is transferred from the refrigerant to the ambient environment in the condenser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The refrigerant is drawn out of the condenser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by gravity, and is subsequently routed through the evaporative subcooler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (arrow <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). The refrigerant is subcooled in the evaporative subcooler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, i.e., the temperature of the refrigerant is reduced below the refrigerant&apos;s saturation temperature (as in the condenser <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thermal energy is transferred from the refrigerant to the ambient environment in the evaporative subcooler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). Subcooling is necessary to prevent vaporization of the refrigerant due to pipe friction after the refrigerant leaves the evaporative subcooler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Subcooling also increases the effectiveness of the evaporator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the refrigeration system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The subcooled refrigerant subsequently flows to the expansion device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (arrow <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). The pressure and the temperature of the refrigerant are reduced as the refrigerant passes through the expansion device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The lower-pressure, lower-temperature refrigerant then flows to the evaporator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the piping <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (arrow <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). The heat-transfer medium that is to be chilled or cooled, e.g., water, is circulated into and out of the evaporator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via piping <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (arrows <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>). The subcooled refrigerant absorbs thermal energy from the heat-transfer medium, thereby chilling or cooling the medium and providing the desired refrigerating effect. The refrigerant is typically superheated to approximately ten degrees Fahrenheit in the evaporator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Superheating is necessary to ensure that potentially damaging liquid droplets are not present in the refrigerant when the refrigerant reenters the compressor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> upon leaving the evaporator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The above-noted cycle is started once again upon the return of the superheated refrigerant to the compressor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The use of the evaporative subcooler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the conventional refrigeration system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> presents substantial disadvantages. For example, the coils of a typical evaporative subcooler such as the subcooler <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are relatively large, thereby increasing the refrigerant-charge requirements for the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Also, the cost of an evaporative subcooler typically represents a substantial portion of the initial overall cost of a refrigeration system such as the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, evaporative subcoolers are usually heavy, and occupy a relatively large volume of equipment space. These characteristics are particularly disadvantageous in rooftop installations, where constraints are commonly imposed on the allowable dimensions and weight of the evaporative subcooler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In light of the above discussion, it is evident that an unfilled need exists for an evaporatively-cooled, direct-expansion refrigeration system that operates without the use of an evaporative subcooler. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A presently-preferred embodiment of the invention is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The invention provides an evaporatively-cooled, direct-expansion refrigeration system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The refrigeration system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a compressor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a condenser <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, an expansion device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and an evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The condenser <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is an evaporative condenser, the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is a shell-and-tube heat exchanger, and the evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is a direct-expansion water chiller in the exemplary system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. These details are presented for illustrative purposes only, as other types of condensers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, heat exchangers <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and evaporators <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be used in accordance with the present invention. For example, alternative embodiments of the invention may use a direct-expansion, fin-tube air-cooling coil as the evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The compressor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, condenser <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, expansion device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are interconnected by piping <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Operational details of the refrigeration system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are as follows. A refrigerant (circulating fluid) such as halocarbon enters the compressor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as superheated vapor (see arrow <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The compressor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> raises the temperature and pressure of the superheated refrigerant. The high-pressure, high-temperature refrigerant is circulated to the condenser <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by way of the piping <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (arrow <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>). The refrigerant is cooled and condensed to saturated liquid in the condenser <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The condensed refrigerant is then circulated to the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (arrow <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>), where it is subcooled, i.e., the temperature of the condensed refrigerant is decreased below the temperature corresponding to saturated liquid at a given pressure. The subcooling of the condensed refrigerant is further discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The subcooled refrigerant flows to the expansion device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> after exiting the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (arrow <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>). The pressure and the temperature of the refrigerant are reduced as the refrigerant passes through the expansion device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The low-pressure, low-temperature refrigerant then circulates to the evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via the piping <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (arrow <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>). A heat-transfer medium, e.g., water, is circulated into and out of the evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via piping <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> (arrows <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>). The subcooled refrigerant receives thermal energy from the heat-transfer medium, thereby chilling the medium and providing the desired refrigerating effect. The transfer of thermal energy from the heat-transfer medium to the refrigerant causes the refrigerant to evaporate. The refrigerant undergoes no more than a minimal amount of superheating in the evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. (The use of water as the heat-transfer medium in the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is mentioned for illustrative purposes only. The invention is also applicable to refrigeration systems that utilize other types of fluids as the heat-transfer medium, including gaseous fluids such as air.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The evaporated refrigerant subsequently flows to the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (arrow <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>). The heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> comprises separate tubing for the evaporated refrigerant and the condensed refrigerant entering the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> from the condenser <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In other words, the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> comprises separate flow paths for the evaporated refrigerant and the condensed refrigerant. The heat-exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> facilitates the transfer of thermal energy from the relatively hot condensed refrigerant to the relatively cold evaporated refrigerant (the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> thus functions as a liquid-to-suction heat exchanger). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An exemplary embodiment of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is shown in cross-section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> comprises an outer tube <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>coaxially disposed around an inner tube <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The condensed refrigerant flows through the outer tube <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in the direction denoted by the arrows <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The evaporated refrigerant flows through the inner tube <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, in the direction denoted by the arrows <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. The heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is shown in detail for exemplary purposes only. The invention can be used in conjunction with virtually any type of heat exchanger that facilitates the transfer of thermal energy between a relatively hot liquid and a relatively cold vapor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The thermal energy transferred to the evaporated refrigerant in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> raises the temperature of the evaporated refrigerant. In particular, the evaporated refrigerant is superheated to a state that is suitable for entry into the compressor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, i.e., the evaporated refrigerant is superheated to a temperature that ensures that liquid droplets are not present in the refrigerant when the refrigerant reenters the compressor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> after leaving the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The refrigerant undergoes no more than a minimal amount of superheating in the evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, as stated above. Thus, all or a substantial majority of the superheating of the refrigerant occurs in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The above-noted cycle is started once again upon the return of the superheated refrigerant to the compressor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The transfer of thermal energy from the condensed refrigerant to the evaporated refrigerant within the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> provides the previously-noted subcooling of the condensed refrigerant. In other words, Applicant has found a way to achieve the desired refrigerating effect in an evaporatively-cooled, direct-expansion refrigeration system without the need for an evaporative subcooler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Eliminating the need for an evaporative subcooler provides the refrigeration system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with substantial advantages in relation to conventional evaporatively-cooled, direct-expansion refrigeration systems such as the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the initial (purchase) cost of an evaporative subcooler is high in relation to the initial cost of a heat exchanger such as the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Hence, eliminating the use of an evaporative subcooler can provide substantial savings in the initial cost of a refrigeration system. Furthermore, the coils of a typical evaporative subcooler require a large refrigerant charge. Hence, eliminating the use of an evaporative subcooler can reduce the overall volume of refrigerant needed to operate a refrigeration system such as the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, thereby leading to substantial cost savings over the life of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, eliminating the use of an evaporative subcooler substantially reduces the overall weight and volume of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This reduction is particularly beneficial because evaporative subcoolers are often installed on roof tops due to the need to expose the subcooler to the ambient environment. Roof-top installations sometimes necessitate structural modifications to the roof and its adjoining structure to accommodate the weight and volume of the subcooler and its mounting hardware. Hence, eliminating the need for an evaporative subcooler and its mounting hardware can obviate the need for such structural modifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides the above-noted advantages without necessarily increasing the operating costs of the refrigeration system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In particular, subcooling the refrigerant in a heat exchanger such as the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> increases the amount of compressor work needed to achieve a given refrigerating effect. This increase is substantially offset, however, by the increased heat-transfer effectiveness of the evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Specifically, using the evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> almost exclusively for evaporating the refrigerant increases the heat-transfer effectiveness of the evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Hence, the evaporator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can achieve a given heat-transfer rate with a higher refrigerant temperature in comparison to an evaporator that both evaporates and superheats the refrigerant. Therefore, the refrigerant of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> does not have to operate at as low a suction temperature and pressure as in a conventional refrigeration system of similar capability. This characteristic allows the compressor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to operate at a higher efficiency than the compressor of a comparable conventional system. The increased efficiency of the compressor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> substantially offsets the increased energy requirements associated with subcooling the refrigerant in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of the parts, within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. </paragraph>
