<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the fabrication of integrated circuits and, more particularly, to the field of polishing and planarizing semiconductor wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art which may be related to various aspects of the present invention which are described and/or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present invention. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Integrated circuits are generally mass produced by fabricating thousands of identical circuit patterns on a single semiconductor wafer and subsequently divided them into identical die or chips. Semiconductor wafers are generally made of silicon. To produce the integrated circuit many commonly known processes are used to modify, remove, and deposit material onto the semiconductor wafer. Processes such as ion implantation, sputtering, etching, chemical vapor deposition and variations thereof, such as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, are among those commonly used These processes are often selectively applied to an integrated circuit through the use of a masking process In the masking process, a photomask containing the pattern of the structure to be fabricated is created, and the wafer is coated with a light sensitive material called photoresist. Then the resist-coated wafer is exposed to ultraviolet light through a photomask to soften or harden parts of the resist depending on whether positive or negative resist is used. Once the softened parts of the resist are removed, the wafer is treated by one of the processes as discussed above to modify, remove, or replace the part unprotected by the resist, and then the remaining resist is stripped. The masking process permits specific areas of the integrated circuit to be modified, removed, or replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> These steps of deposition or removal are frequently followed by a planarization step such as chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). Generally speaking, planarization is a process of removing material to render a surface smooth. CMP is the process of smoothing and planing aided by chemical and mechanical forces. The planarization process helps to minimize barriers to multilayer formation and metallization, as well as to smooth, flatten, and clean the surface. This process involves chemically etching a surface while also mechanically polishing it. The combined action of surface chemical reaction and mechanical polishing allows for controlled, layer-by-layer removal of the desired material from the wafer surface resulting in the preferential removal of protruding surface topography and producing a planarized wafer surface. In the past few years, CMP has become one of the most effective techniques for planarizing a semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In general, the CMP process involves holding a semiconductor substrate, such as a wafer against a rotating wetted polishing pad under controlled downward pressure. Alternately, the CMP process may involve holding a wetted polishing pad while rotating a semiconductor substrate, such as a wafer, under controlled downward pressure. A polishing slurry deposited onto the polishing pad contains etchants and an abrasive material such as alumina or silica. A rotating wafer carrier is typically utilized to hold the wafer under controlled pressure against a polishing pad. The polishing pad is typically made up of a soft material such as felt fabric impregnated with blown polyurethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The CMP process consists of moving a sample surface to be polished against a pad that is used to provide support against the sample surface, and providing slurry between a sample surface and pad to effect the polishing leading to planarization. Abrasive particles in the slurry cause mechanical damage on the sample surface, loosening the material for enhanced chemical attack or fracturing off the pieces of surface into a slurry where they dissolve or are swept away. The process is tailored to provide enhanced material removal rate with high points on surfaces, thus affecting the planarization. Note that chemistry alone typically will not achieve planarization because most chemical actions are isotopic. Mechanical grinding alone, theoretically, may achieve the desired planarization but is generally not desirable because of the extensive associated damage of the material surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As described above, the three key elements in the CMP process include the surface to be polished, the pad which enables the transfer of mechanical forces to the surface being polished, and the slurry which provides both chemical and mechanical effects. The term pad is used loosely to refer to any soft material which assists in material removal. One such pad is a polishing web. A polishing web is generally a continuous roll of material which is fed through a series of rollers on a CMP system. The web is fed across a table with a solid support surface where a rotating wafer carrier applies the downward mechanical force against the web in order to facilitated the polishing of the wafer. As a wafer is planarized, material is removed from the wafer and deposited onto the web. Before the next wafer is processed, the excess material deposited by the previous wafer should be removed from the web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Currently, to clean the web between each planarization cycle, the web must be advanced from the polishing area and treated with a cleaning agent. To advance the web, the rollers on the CMP system must be rotated. If the rollers are advanced forward to facilitate the cleaning process, new webbing, previously unexposed because of its positioning on the web roll, will be exposed to possible contamination. Once the roll is retracted to its original position after the cleaning process, the contaminated portion of the web is rolled into the unexposed roll thereby introducing contaminants to previously unexposed portions of the web roll. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention may address one or more of the problems set forth above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Certain aspects commensurate in scope with the disclosed embodiments are set forth below. It should be understood that these aspects are presented merely to provide the reader with a brief summary of certain forms the invention might take and that these aspects are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Indeed, the invention may encompass a variety of aspects that may not be set forth below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a fluid spray bar is coupled to a frame assembly. The frame assembly can be coupled to an existing CMP system to provide a means of cleaning the web without having to advance the web from its present position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The fluid spray bar may include a plurality of fluid chambers. The fluid chambers may be filled with a web-cleaning fluid. A motor is coupled to the frame assembly. The motor facilitates the movement of the fluid spray bar along the length of the frame assembly. The fluid spray bar is positioned proximate to the web. After a CMP cycle, there are abrasive particles left on the web from the polishing of the wafer, as well as the chemical slurry used in the CMP process. In between planarization cycles, the web can be cleaned so that the same portion of the polishing web may be used to planarize another wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To clean the web after a wafer has been polished, the fluid spray bar traverses the area of the web to be cleaned. As the fluid spray bar moves along the frame assembly, a cleaning fluid is dispensed onto the web. The cleaning fluid is deposited with a force and trajectory which is sufficient to remove the abrasive particles and excess chemical slurry from the polishing web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This embodiment will facilitate reuse of web material without contaminating any of the pristine portions of the web. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> One or more specific embodiments of the present invention will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers&apos; specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic isometric view of an exemplary web-format planarizing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for planarizing a substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which may benefit from the present invention, although it will be understood that the machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may take other forms that may benefit as well. The planarizing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a table <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a rigid panel or plate to provide a flat, solid support surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for supporting a portion of a web-format planarizing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a planarizing zone &ldquo;A.&rdquo; The planarizing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also has a pad advancing mechanism including a plurality of rollers to guide, position, and hold the web-format pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> over the support surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The pad advancing mechanism generally includes a supply roller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, tensioning rollers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, idler rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a take-up roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As explained below, a motor (not shown) drives the take-up roller <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to advance the pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> across the support surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> along a travel axis T-T. The motor can also drive the supply roller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The idler rollers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>press an operative portion of the pad against the support surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to hold the pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> stationary during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The planarizing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also has a carrier assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to translate the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> across the pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the carrier assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to pick up, hold, and release the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at appropriate stages of the planarizing process. The head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may also be configured to rotate about the shaft <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The carrier assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also has a support gantry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a drive assembly <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> that can move along the gantry <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The drive assembly <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has an actuator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a drive shaft <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> coupled to the actuator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and an arm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> projecting from the drive shaft <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The arm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> carriers the head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via a second shaft <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The actuator <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> orbits the head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> about an axis B-B to move the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> across the pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. While the present embodiment provides a system which supports both rotation of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (about the shaft <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>) and orbiting (about an axis B-B), an alternate embodiment may provide a system which provides either rotation alone or orbiting alone. Further, some current systems use a planar vibration, rather than a rotation or orbit. The present invention may also be implemented in CMP systems which use planar vibration to provide differential motion between the positioning pad and the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be a non-abrasive polymeric pad (e.g., polyurethane), or it may be a fixed-abrasive polishing pad in which abrasive particles are fixedly dispersed in a resin or another type of suspension medium. A planarizing fluid is deposited onto the pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as part of the planarizing operation. While various techniques may be used for depositing this fluid, in this embodiment, the planarizing fluid <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> flows from a plurality of nozzles <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> during planarization of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The planarizing fluid <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be a conventional CMP slurry with abrasive particles and chemicals that etch and/or oxidize the surface of the substrate assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or the planarizing fluid <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; non-abrasive planarizing solution without abrasive particles. In most CMP applications, abrasive slurries with abrasive particles are used on nonabrasive polishing pads, and non-abrasive clean solutions without abrasive particles are used on fixed-abrasive polishing pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> During the operation of the planarizing machine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> moves across the support surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> along the pad travel path T-T either during or between planarizing cycles to change the particular portion of the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the planarizing zone A. For example, the supply and take-up rollers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can drive the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> between planarizing cycles such that a point P moves incrementally across the support surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to a number of intermediate locations I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, etc. Alternatively, the rollers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may drive the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> between planarizing cycles such that the point P moves all the way across the support surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to completely remove a used portion of the pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from the planarizing zone A. The rollers may also continuously drive the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at a slow rate during a planarizing cycle such that the point P moves continuously across the support surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Thus, the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> should be free to move axially over the length of the support surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> along the pad travel path T-T </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> To reuse a portion of polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be advanced along pad travel path T-T between planarizing cycles. The polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is advanced far enough to allow the portion of the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which was previously in the planarizing zone A to be clear of the planarizing zone A so that it may be cleaned. Once the previously used portion of the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is cleaned, the supply roller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is reversed, thereby placing the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in its previous position to allow reuse of the portion of the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which was used in the previous planarizing cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Disadvantageously, by advancing the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> along travel path T-T to facilitate cleaning, a previously unexposed portion of polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is exposed to possible contamination as it is advanced from the supply roller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As the polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is reversed to facilitate reuse of the cleaned area, the exposed portion of polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is reintroduced to the portion of polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is still on the supply roller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This introduces contaminants to the previously clean and unexposed portion of polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a perspective view of a web-format planarizing machine <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which includes an exemplary web-cleaning apparatus. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the planarizing machine <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and frame assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be comprised of a fluid chamber which permits a cleaning fluid to be dispensed on the surface of the web to facilitate cleaning. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is coupled to the frame assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in such a way as to allow the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to traverse path T-T between planarizing cycles. The fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may travel along rails <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> between planarizing cycles to dispense a web cleaning fluid. The fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be activated immediately after a polishing cycle to rinse any particles or fluids from the polishing web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be activated immediately prior to a polishing cycle to wet the polishing web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which may assist in the CMP process. However, it may not be desirable to activate the spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> between each polishing cycle. Instead, the polishing web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be activated intermittently between some fixed number of polishing cycles or at any time that the polishing web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> needs cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> dispenses the fluid at such an angle and with such force so as to remove polish refuse deposited during the planarizing process from the web surface. The polish refuse and cleaning fluid are then carried to the fluid depository <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the laminar flow of the cleaning fluid, as determined by the angle and positions of the spray nozzles (illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), can be adjusted such that no excess cleaning fluid is left on the polishing web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. However, it may be desirable to leave some amount of excess cleaning fluid on the polishing web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be adjusted to provide for this effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be used to dispense a cleaning agent onto the polishing web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> between polishing cycles. Generally, the wafer is removed from the planarizing machine <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> during the dispensing of the cleansing agent. It may also be desirable to use the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to dispense a corrosion inhibitor such as Benzine Tryazole (BTA). During the planarization process, slurry material may attach itself to the wafer. Because the wafer often includes metal traces on its surface, the traces and pads may begin to corrode due to the slurry deposition. To mitigate this effect, the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may dispense a corrosion inhibitor to rinse the wafer before the wafer is removed from the planarization machine <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The corrosion inhibitor may be dispensed for as little as 3 to 5 seconds to drive any remaining slurry from the surface of the wafer and passivate the wafer with the corrosion inhibitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An alternate embodiment may provide a means for removing excess cleaning fluid which has been dispensed on the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may comprise a squeegee <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>) to sweep the surface of web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> traverses path T-T in the direction opposite to the direction of motion of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> while it was dispensing the cleaning fluid. Alternately, the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may comprise air blowers to blow any excess cleaning fluid from the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> traverses path T-T in the direction opposite to the direction of motion of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as it was dispensing the cleaning fluid. The air blowers provide an alternate, non-contact means of removing the excess cleaning fluid from the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may also comprise an additional chamber <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which may be an air chamber through which air may flow to assist in removing the excess cleaning fluid form the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The air may enter through a hose (not shown) which may be attached to an opening <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> at the end of the additional chamber <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The air may be blown onto the web by a second set of nozzles <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> located on the back side of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> illustrate one exemplary embodiment of the frame assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with the understanding that various mechanisms may be used to cause the flow bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to move relative to the pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> during the cleaning operation. A motor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is coupled to frame assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to drive the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> along each of the rails <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, lead screws <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are mounted along rails <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The lead screws <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are connected by belt <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Motor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> drives the belt <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> so as to turn lead screws <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, thereby facilitating the movement of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> along pad travel path T-T. As the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> traverses travel path T-T, a web cleaning fluid may be dispensed from the spray bar assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> onto the web-format polishing pad <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the frame assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> will also permit variable travel speeds of approximately one quarter inch per second to three inches per second, for example, depending on the web material composition and the amount of cleaning required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an enlarged view of the embodiment disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As motor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> rotates the lead screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the belt <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> moves along travel path T-T. For the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to receive web cleaning fluid, a fluid hose <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is coupled to the fluid spray bar. As the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> moves along travel path T-T, the fluid hose <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may also travel along path T-T. To facilitate the movement of fluid hose <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, fluid hose slot <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be provided along the rails <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Here, the motor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will turn the single lead screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, there is no belt <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> because there is no lead screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on the side of frame assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which is opposite motor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Instead, a guide rod <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is provided to facilitate uniform movement of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> along the travel path T-T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> While the spray bar assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may take various suitable forms, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 10</cross-reference> illustrate one exemplary embodiment of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As can best be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> advantageously includes two members, illustrated by reference numerals <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a plan view of the first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates an exploded view of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, including first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> includes a primary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and a secondary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. The web cleaning fluid enters the primary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> through the inlet <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> which is attached to the fluid hose <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). The first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> utilizes mounting brackets <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> to facilitate attachment of the second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The mounting brackets <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> are configured to receive screws <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> that secure the second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to the first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and thus form the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> also advantageously includes a guiding member <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> that ensures uniform movement of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as it traverses the web. The guiding member is inserted in a rail slot on the side of the system opposite the fluid hose <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, as will be further illustrated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is best illustrated by referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a backside plan view of the second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> includes a fluid chamber <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and spray nozzles <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is coupled to the first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, in such a way as to allow the fluid chamber <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> of the second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to align with the secondary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is coupled to the second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> by screws <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, which pass through screw hole <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> in the second member. Fluid chamber <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is also fluidically coupled to spray nozzles <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. As the cleaning fluid enters the primary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> through inlet <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, the fluid fills the primary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and then flows into the secondary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. Because the second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is coupled to first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in such a way as to align fluid chamber <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> with the secondary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, fluid chamber <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> also fills with web cleaning fluid. Because the fluid spray nozzles <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are fluidically coupled to the fluid chamber <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, the web cleaning fluid is forced through the spray nozzles <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and onto the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> seal <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be used between the first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to provide an even contact and secure coupling in the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Seal ring <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may also be used to ensure no leakage of the cleaning fluid into the mounting brackets <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> illustrate a cross-sectional view of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> along lines <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, respectively. The only difference between <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a cross-section taken through screw <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a cross-section taken only through the fluid chambers <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Primary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> can be seen as the largest fluid reservoir. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> also show the fluid coupling between fluid chamber <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> in the second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and secondary fluid chamber <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> in the first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Once the first member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is coupled to the second member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the spray nozzles <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are formed to provide an outlet for the web cleaning fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> An alternate embodiment of the fluid spray bar may include only a single member. The single member may contain one or more fluid chambers, which are coupled to nozzles that dispense the cleaning fluid onto the web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> coupled to the web-format planarizing machine. As can be seen, the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> travels along rails <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> along the travel path T-T. After a planarizing cycle, polish refuse <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> will remain on the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The polish refuse <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is a result of the material removal on the polishing surface which has been deposited onto web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> traverses path T-T by means of frame assembly <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a web cleaning fluid is deposited onto web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to remove the polish refuse <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> from the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The polish refuse <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is swept by the cleaning fluid into the fluid depository <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> This process is better illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> which illustrates an enlarged view of the fluid spray bar coupled to the web-format planarizing machine <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Again, as the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> traverses travel path T-T along lead screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> deposits a web cleaning fluid <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> onto the web surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. After the polishing cycle, the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is held stationary while the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> travels the length of the polish area spraying a web cleaning fluid, such as deionized water, a ph-adjusted solution such as ammonia, or a surfactant. The spray stream of the web cleaning fluid <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is positioned approximately one quarter to one eighth of an inch above the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at a low angle (10&deg; to 30&deg;). This small distance and low angle cause the fluid <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to create a sweeping action on the surface of the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This sweeping action carries the polish refuse <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and excess chemicals off of the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and into the fluid depository <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (not shown) leaving the web surface puddle free. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> While the present embodiment discloses a fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which deposits a laminar flow onto the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through a series of spray nozzles <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in such a way as to permit complete spray coverage of the polishing region of web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> while the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> moves only in the T-T direction, it should be appreciated that alternate embodiments may be incorporated. One such embodiment may cause the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to oscillate in a direction which is perpendicular to travel path T-T. Structurally, this embodiment may be constructed using a cam <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and spring <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be mounted on guide blocks <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. A shaft <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> may be mounted through the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and guide blocks <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, to facilitate oscillation of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> when used in conjunction with a cam <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and spring <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The oscillation may allow fewer spray nozzles <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, or may allow the spray nozzles <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to be constructed to provide a spray flow having a narrower angle pattern, rather than the large angled spray flow used to clean the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a non-oscillating system. The oscillation motion provides complete coverage and, thus, complete cleaning of the polishing area on web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates a top view of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as it traverses the rails <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, along path T-T. Inlet <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and guiding member <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> are also illustrated. The fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is coupled between guide blocks <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, as illustrated more fully in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The guide blocks <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> facilitate the movement of the spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> along path T-T by the rotation of the lead screws <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. If the system is a non-belt system, as previously discussed, only one lead screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be used. In this case, a guide rod <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be used to better control the movement of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as it traverses path T-T on the guide blocks <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

For fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to slide along lead screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a guide block <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may be used. The guide block <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> holds fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in place. The guide block <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> includes screw threads <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> through which the lead screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be mounted. As the lead screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> rotates, screw threads <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> force the guide block <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> down the length of the lead screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is coupled to the guide block <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and, thus, traverses the length of the lead screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> along with the guide block <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The inlet <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is fed through opening <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> in the guide block <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. To ensure proper alignment of the spray nozzles <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with respect to the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (not shown), a guide pin <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is located on the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The guide pin <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> ensures that the spray nozzles <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> be angled with respect to the web <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (not shown). The fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is held in place in the guide block <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> by set screw <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The inlet <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> through which the cleaning fluid enters the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is long enough to run completely through the opening <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and out the other side of the guide block <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The excess length in the inlet <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is oriented in such a way as to facilitate the coupling of inlet <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> with fluid hose slot <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in rail <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. This configuration will allow the fluid spray bar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to traverse the length of the web in a stable and controlled manner. </paragraph>

This embodiment may eliminate the use of the carrier assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to deposit the planarizing fluid <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> While one advantageous use of the present invention may be in a web-based system, it should be appreciated that the current system may be modified for use in a non-web-based system. A cleaning system as described herein may be used in any system which implements a CMP process and reuses a polishing pad between planarization cycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> While the invention may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and have been described in detail herein.
