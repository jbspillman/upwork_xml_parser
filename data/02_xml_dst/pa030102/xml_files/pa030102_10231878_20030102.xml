<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to metal-gas cell batteries, such as metal-air cell batteries. More particularly, the present invention relates to mechanically rechargeable metal-air cell batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More powerful and longer-lasting batteries are a high priority item for all countries seeking to replace hydrocarbon-fueled vehicles with smogless electrically powered vehicles. A great deal of research is thus presently focused on metal-gas cell batteries, such as zinc-air batteries. Zinc-air batteries have the highest theoretical specific energy content of all known battery types. Many problems, however, must be overcome before vehicles powered by zinc-air batteries, which are regarded as acceptable alternatives to vehicles burning hydrocarbon fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> All metal-gas cell batteries comprise a plurality of cells. Each of the cells has at least a gas cathode and a metal anode separated by a quantity of alkaline electrolyte and some form of mechanical separator sheet. During the operation of metal-gas cell batteries, a reactant gas, such as oxygen, reacts at each gas cathode to form hydroxide ions, and these hydroxide ions, in the alkaline electrolyte, react with metal anode material at each metal anode. The process creates an electrical potential between each gas cathode and each metal anode. When the cells are connected in series, the combined electrical potential of all cells is considerable and can be used as a source of electrical power. As can be seen, however, the operation of the battery gradually depletes the available metal anode material. Therefore, the battery has to be periodically recharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Metal-gas cell batteries can be recharged either electrically or mechanically. Electrical recharging can be easily adapted to the existing power networks, but the service life of the electrically rechargeable metal-gas battery is markedly limited. Moreover, an electrically rechargeable metal-gas battery requires a bifunctional or an additional gas diffusion electrode. Due to the need for such a bifunctional or additional gas diffusion electrode, the battery is unduly heavy, bulky and complicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the current preferred recharging mode for metal-gas cell batteries is mechanical refueling, whereby the spent metal anode is physically replaced with a fresh metal anode. Mechanical refueling can be accomplished in two ways. When the metal anode comprises metallic pellets or powder suspended within the electrolyte, the spent metallic pellets or powder is pumped from the cell and fresh metallic pellets or powder is pumped into the cell. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,981,747, 5,006,424, 5,434,020 and 5,558,947 disclose attempts to use zinc particles or pellets as anodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An even simpler method of mechanical refueling is possible if the metal anode is a rigid structure, for example, made of a conductive support packed with zinc powder. The spent metal anode is removed and a fresh metal anode is reinstalled into the cell. This refueling method is generally employed because of its theoretical, construction, maintenance and operation simplicity. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,513,030, 5,208,526, 5,318,861, 5,366,822, 5,418,080, 5,447,805, 5,753,384, 5,904,999 and 6,057,052 all disclose various methods of mechanically refueling metal-gas cell batteries by replacing the spent rigid anode structure. Each of the patents listed is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One problem with such conventional metal-gas cell batteries is that the rigid anode structures are difficult to remove from and insert into the cell. In a conventional cell where the housing of the cell is wholly rigid, clearances for the removal and reinsertion of such anodes are generally very small. The gas cathodes and separator sheets are often abraded during the removal and reinsertion of the anodes. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,389,466 and 4,560,626 disclose an attempt to solve this problem. However, in these patents, the total contact area between the cone-shaped current collectors and the metal anodes of the metal-gas cell batteries is not sufficiently large for large currents. Moreover, pinpoints on the current collectors often make the insertion and extraction of the metal anodes very difficult. Another attempt to solve this problem is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,578. In this patent, a collapsible electrochemical cell made by &ldquo;a flexible plastic material&rdquo; is suggested to satisfy its collapsible design. No detail of the flexible plastic material is disclosed. However, such housing system is fragile and cannot withstand repeated refueling. Other wholly flexible housing systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,415,949 and 5,650,241. Such housing systems are unduly complex and are therefore expensive to manufacture, maintain and operate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,389,466 and 4,560,626 disclose a soft bladder to press the zinc anode against the multi-points and cone-shaped current collector. These designs have many problems and are not discussed here. In fact, no commercial product on the market comes even close to the designs described in these patents. Another problem with metal-gas cell batteries, which are mechanically refueled by physical replacement of a rigid anode structure, is the frequent leakage of the alkaline electrolyte. In most prior art designs, the housing of the metal-gas cell is usually opened at the top. The opening is sealed during operation by an elastic sealing element disposed between the cell housing and a protruding portion of the anode assembly. This protruding portion of the anode assembly is universally used in such designs for electrical connection to other battery electrodes. Moreover, it is common to provide one or two small breathing holes along the uppermost portion of the cell proximal to the protruding portion of the anode. However, alkaline electrolyte tends to creep up the anode and out of the cell along the protruding portion of the anode. Also, alkaline mist continuously escapes through the breathing holes. Such leakage and mist can cause rapid oxidation of the conductors of the anode and the air cathode. Oxidation dramatically increases the electrical resistance between the contact surfaces and therefore results in a marked loss of battery power. Moreover, the continual leakage of alkaline electrolyte and electrolyte mist makes the battery difficult to use in any kind of environment where oxidation of metallic items outside the battery is a problem. Finally, any upset of the battery during handling or operation will cause copious leakage of alkaline electrolyte out of the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As a matter of fact, secondary zinc-air fuel cells or batteries, no matter whether mechanically refuelable or electrically rechargeable, have not been manufactured on a large scale as a commercial product. Only primary zinc-air button cell and zinc-air battery, which are not rechargeable, for navigation lamps can be found on the market at present. This is because no one has yet solved the problem of the separator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> All the secondary zinc-air batteries having zinc electrode suffer from a short service life because the batteries are short-circuited by zinc dendrites growing from the zinc electrode during recharging. The sharp zinc dendrites stab the separator like needles and bridge the zinc anode to the air cathode. Therefore, short circuits often occur, Batteries like Ni&mdash;Zn battery, Ag&mdash;Zn battery and the electrical rechargeable zinc-air fuel cells have the same serious problems due to frequent recharging. Theoretically, the mechanically refuelable secondary zinc-air fuel cell should not suffer from this problem, as it is not electrically recharged. However, the mechanically refuelable zinc-air fuel cells do suffer this problem, although with lesser frequency. Even at a lesser frequency, it is still a serious problem, as when even one cell in a multi-cell module is short-circuited, the whole module fails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The principle by which unpredicted zinc dendrites occasionally grow and cause short circuits is not clear yet, but may be due to the following reason. During the discharge of the uneven density of the zinc powder distribution on the anode plate, the electrical potential is different on different location of the zinc electrode. As a result of reducing zincates in the alkaline electrolyte to deposit metal zinc on the zinc anode surface, the zinc dendrites are formed at lower potential locations of the zinc electrode. These dendrites rapidly span the narrow gap between the anode and the cathode to short the cell. Therefore, the previous art designs either cannot avoid occasional short circuits or sacrifice significantly the performance of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To avoid the zinc dendrites causing short circuits, in the traditional zinc-air battery used for powering a navigation lamp, the zinc electrode is usually wrapped in multiple layers of separator paper to enhance resistibility thereof stabbing by zinc dendrites. Additionally, the distance from the air cathode to the zinc anode is enlarged to about 10 mm or more, so that the zinc dendrites cannot grow long enough to reach the air cathode. As the result of increasing the electric resistance of the multiple layers of separator paper and the thickness of the electrolyte, the internal resistance of the cell is increased, too. Hence, this kind of zinc-air battery can only deliver low power; it is enough to power a navigation lamp or a communication equipment unit, but not adequate to power an electric vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Mechanically refuelable secondary zinc-air fuel cells are expected to have a service life that is a few hundred times longer than the disposable zinc-air fuel cells. The separator is too expensive to be renewed during every refueling; the separator has to be reusable over the whole service life of the zinc-air fuel cells. U.S. Pat. No. 5,418,080 discloses a 400-mesh fabric separator bag employed in a zinc-air fuel cell. This separator bag is made of polypropylene fabric or polymeric amide and is expected to be strong enough to work in an alkaline electrolyte for several years. But the separator bag needs to be slipped onto the zinc anode plate and has to be washed after every discharge. Otherwise, zinc oxide residue tends to block the pores of the fabric as well as the transfer of ions, which ions would otherwise penetrate the pores of the fabric to transfer electricity between the cathode and the anode. As a result, the output power is lowered from time to time. U.S. Pat. No. 5,431,823 also discloses a specially designed tool for washing the separator bag. Even with this specially designed washing tool, the separator bags have to be manually slipped onto and removed from the washing tools. Besides, the separator bags have to be manually slipped onto and removed from the zinc anodes as well. If the huge quantity of anodes and separator bags when hundreds of thousands of zinc-air fuel cells are in use is considered, this labor-intensive processing is obviously too expensive to be a real commercial solution, even in developing countries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, although by visual observation, the 400-mesh fabric is a fine and close texture, its openings are too large to prevent the zinc dendrites from passing through. Therefore, the short circuit caused by zinc dendrites cannot be avoided for sure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Kummrow&apos;s zinc-air battery uses fabric as the separator bag, too. Slightly differing from U.S. Pat. No. 5,418,080, it uses a thicker fabric. In order to prevent short circuits caused by zinc dendrites, a polypropylene box with big holes on its two major surfaces is used to envelop the zinc anode and its separator bag. Therefore, it entails not only the expensive, labor-intensive operation of changing and washing the separator bags, but also the additional changing and washing the polypropylene boxes. Furthermore, the gaps between the zinc anodes and the air cathodes are increased to about 10 mm. This construction may not suffer from short circuits caused by zinc dendrites, but the power output is significantly reduced. It may suitable for low power use, but definitely is not suitable for high power requirements, such as electric vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> From the commercial point of view, the expensive labor-intensive operation of changing and washing the separator bags has to be eliminated; the separator has to be installed permanently in the zinc-air fuel cell. Consequently, none of the existing constructions solves the problem caused by zinc dendrites short circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Another serious problem arises when the separator is permanently installed in the zinc-air fuel cell. The pores of the separator are passages for the hydroxide ions. If the pores are blocked by zinc oxide, the hydroxide ions are blocked, too. Hence the zinc anode will be hungry from lack of hydroxide ions, and the power output will decrease over time as the openings of the separator are increasingly blocked, Even when the discharging current is turned off, the pores of the micro-porous separator are plugged by the precipitation of zincates to zinc oxide from the electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The separator is one of the keys to the performance and durability of the secondary zinc-air fuel cells and batteries. The separator&apos;s ability to control the exchange of ions plays a limiting role in determining maximum power to weight ratio; this is especially important for the zinc-air fuel cells for powering electric vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Attempts to avoid the dendrite-shorting problem using metal or metal oxide as barrier layers are illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,539,396 and 4,298,666. Nickel powder is commonly used in these patents because it reacts with the zinc dendrites as a micro cell to prevent the continuous growing of the dendrites. Separators selected from the above patents could be the solution to the separator problem for zinc-air rechargeable battery, although they are expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> For mechanically refuelable zinc-air fuel cells, no matter whether its discharged anode has to be replaced or recharged in another recharging cell, the separators with metal or metal oxide barrier layer are not necessary. Separators selected from the following patents may be good enough for mechanically refuelable zinc-air fuel cells. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,154,912, 4,272,470 and 6,033,806 disclose a graft polyvinyl alcohol separator, which may be effective to avoid dendrite short-circuiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 4,359,510, a novel structure of separator is disclosed. A hydrophobic micro-porous non-woven web is first treated with a wet agent and then coated with cellulose on both sides. This manufactured separator has a low ionic resistance, good hydrophilic ability, dendrite-shorting resistance, and pore-plug resistance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is another objective of the present invention to provide a metal-gas cell battery that can eliminate the expensive and labor-intensive operation of changing and washing the separator bags. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the foregoing and other objectives of the present invention, the invention describes a metal-gas cell battery comprising at least one metal-gas cell. Each metal-gas cell comprises the following. A first gas cathode is disposed within a rigid planar first retaining structure, The first gas cathode is permeable to air but impermeable to liquids and allows the passage of gases into the cell. A second gas cathode is disposed within a rigid planar second retaining structure. The second gas cathode is permeable to air but impermeable to liquids and allows the passage of gases into the cell. The second retaining structure is moveable with respect to the first retaining structure between a first retaining structure position, in which the second retaining structure is proximal to the first retaining structure, and a second retaining structure position, in which the second retaining structure is spaced apart from the first retaining structure. The second gas cathode is electrically connected to the first gas cathode. A soft pocket is disposed between the first gas cathode and the second gas cathode.

The first retaining structure, the first gas cathode, the first wall, the second wall, the second retaining structure and the second gas cathode together define a liquid retaining soft pocket chamber having a lower portion, an upper portion and a top opening defined between the top edges of the first and the second walls. The top opening of the soft pocket chamber is open when the first and the second retaining structures are in the second retaining structure position and tightly closed when the first and the second retaining structures are in the first retaining structure position. Finally, a soft pocket closing mechanism for securing the first and the second retaining structures is located in the first retaining structure position. A metal anode is disposed within the soft pocket chamber, and two separator sheets are permanently and respectively installed between the gas cathodes and protective meshes thereof, no matter whether a discharged anode has to be replaced or recharged in separated recharging cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The cell further comprises a positive battery terminal electrically connected to the first and the second gas cathodes and a negative battery terminal electrically connected to the metal anode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In a typical embodiment of the invention, the first and the second gas cathodes are air cathodes and the metal anode is substantially made of metallic zinc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the metal anode is wholly disposed within the soft pocket chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the metal-gas cell battery further comprises a second semi-permeable membrane disposed within the upper portion of the soft pocket chamber to reduce the pressure difference between the soft pocket chamber and the outside atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the invention, the soft pocket can be made of any elastic material which resists deterioration from the electrolyte. These materials include neoprene, ethylene propylene diene monomer, butyl rubber, ethylene propylene copolymer, and chlorosulfonated polyethylene. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. This discussion should not be construed, however, as limiting the invention to those particular embodiments. Practitioners skilled in the art will recognize numerous other embodiments as well. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The function of a separator for commercial secondary zinc-air fuel cell should mechanically separate the gas cathode and the metal anode and also have the following characteristics: (1) The separators have to be absorptive and readily allow the transport of hydroxide ions to reduce the electrical resistance of the zinc-air fuel cell. (2) The separators have to be impermeable to zincates. (3) The separators have to be chemically stable in the alkaline electrolyte environment. (4) The separators have to be resistant to penetration by zinc dendrites. (5) The pores of the separators must avoid blockage by precipitation of zinc oxide. (6) The separators must last for the whole service life of the zinc-air fuel cells. (7) The separators must as cheap as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the foregoing and other needs, the invention provides a metal-gas cell battery. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a metal-gas cell battery according to one preferred embodiment of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> metal-gas cell battery <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of metal-gas cells <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connected in series, a positive battery terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a negative battery terminal (not shown). A reactive gas used for the cathode is oxygen, such as from air, and the anode material is zinc or similar metal. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, air for providing cooling and reactive oxygen to the metal-gas cell battery <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> flows through gaps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> between the metal-gas cells <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The number of metal-gas cells <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the metal-gas cell battery <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> depends upon what voltage is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the metal-gas cell battery <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a front cover plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a rear cover plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The front cover plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> protects the outermost first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the first metal-gas cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the rear cover plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> protects the outermost second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the last metal-gas cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a metal-gas cell useable in the metal-gas cell battery of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the metal-gas cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and a soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> disposed between the first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> defines a soft pocket chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Each metal-gas cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> further comprises a metal anode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> disposed within the soft pocket chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the metal anode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is wholly disposed within the soft pocket chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an exploded view of the metal-gas cell (without anode) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed within a first retaining structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which is rigid and planar. The first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> permeable to the reactive gas but impermeable to liquids. When the reactive gas is atmospheric oxygen, the first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> allows the passage of oxygen from the atmosphere into the metal-gas cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is disposed within a second retaining structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which is also rigid and planar. The second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also is permeable to the reactive gas but impermeable to liquids. When the reactive gas is atmospheric oxygen, the second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> allows the passage of oxygen from the atmosphere into the cell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The second retaining structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is moveable with respect to the first retaining structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> between a first retaining structure position and a second retaining structure position. The second retaining structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is proximal to the first retaining structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> when the first and the second retaining structures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are in the first retaining structure position. The second retaining structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is spaced apart from the first retaining structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> when the first and the second retaining structures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are in the second retaining structure position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Both the first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprise a supporting lattice structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which allows sufficient air flows through the first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view taken along DD of the unfolded soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a top opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The top opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is open when the first and the second retaining structures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are in the second retaining structure position. The top opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is tightly closed when the first and the second retaining structures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are in the first retaining structure position. &ldquo;Be tightly closed&rdquo; means that the top opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is sufficiently sealed to prevent the leakage of electrolyte or electrolyte fumes from the soft pocket chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> again, the soft pockets <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the series connected metal-gas cells <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be closed for securing the first and the second retaining structures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the first retaining structure position. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the soft pocket closing mechanism can be nuts <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and screws <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extending from the front cover plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the rear cover plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the two outmost pi-shaped reinforced metal fittings <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the positive battery terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be a male cone-shaped or cylindrical shaped structure disposed in the front cover plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The negative battery terminal (not shown) can be a corresponding female cone-shaped or cylindrical shaped structure disposed in the rear cover plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The positive battery terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to the first and second gas cathodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The negative battery terminal is electrically connected to the metal anode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the metal anode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is wholly disposed within the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The metal anode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comprises a support structure <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> having a support base portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and a tab portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> above the support base portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The support base portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the tab portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be made of any conductive material. Therefore, the support structure <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is electrically conductive. Copper is preferably used for the support structure <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> because of its low cost, rigidity and high conductivity. The support base portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> should be rigid enough to minimize damage or distortion during recycling and provide a large cross-sectional area to allow high current flow with minimal voltage drop. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, openings <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on the support base portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> reduce the weight of the support structure <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and are packed with the metal powder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> on both sides of the support base portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> into an integral whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Metal powder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, such as zinc powder, is pressed onto the base portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to form an anode base portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the openings <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the support base portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are located and configured such that the electrical resistance between all the metal powder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the support base portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is nearly identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The anode base portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is preferably planar and shaped to provide a large surface area. To facilitate the installation of the metal anode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, it is also preferable that the length of the lowermost edge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the anode base portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> be shorter than that of the uppermost edge <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the anode base portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Thus, in a typical embodiment, the anode base portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is trapezoidal in shape with the lowermost edge <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the anode base portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> being slightly shorter in length than the uppermost edge <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the anode base portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. In such embodiments, it is also typical, but not necessary, for the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to have equivalent shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The tab portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the support structure <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> provides a convenient handle which is useful in the installation and removal of the metal anode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The tab portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> further provides an electrical connection means for the metal anode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as described below. In the preferred embodiments where the metal anode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is wholly disposed within the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> during operation, the tab portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> needs no sealing elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there are a few extended pieces <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> located at the inner periphery of the first and the second retaining structures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. These extended pieces <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> are used to keep the metal anode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the right position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> separator sheet <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is permanently installed between the first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the protective mesh <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>; a separator sheet <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is permanently installed between the second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the protective mesh <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In order to show clearly the construction of the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, cross-sectional views DD, EE and FF are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. The M-shaped cross section shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is designed to ensure sufficient flexibility of the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a flexible and planar first wall <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and a flexible and planar second wall <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The periphery of the first wall <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> has a top edge <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, and the periphery of the second wall <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> has a top edge <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. The periphery of the first wall <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is connected to the periphery of the second wall <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> except along the respective top edges <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. The periphery of the first wall <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is attached to the first retaining structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and the periphery of the second wall <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is attached to the second retaining structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the first retaining structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the first wall <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, the second wall <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, the second retaining structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> define a soft pocket chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 9</cross-reference>) for retaining liquid. The soft pocket chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has a lower portion <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, an upper portion <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) and a top opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The top opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is defined between the top edges <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of the first wall <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and the second wall <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The top opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is open when the first and the second retaining structures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are in the second retaining structure position and tightly closed when the first and the second retaining structures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are in the first retaining structure position. Any elastic material capable of resisting the electrolyte deterioration can be used to make the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. These materials include neoprene, PVC, ethylene propylene diene monomer, butyl rubber, ethylene propylene copolymer, and chlorosulfonated polyethylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The grooves <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> on the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> fit onto the periphery <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the first retaining structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the periphery <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the second retaining structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), respectively. The four edges of both grooves <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> securely fit onto the four edges of the periphery <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and periphery <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and are sealed by tightly pressing the metal-fittings <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) onto the outer surfaces <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the grooves <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the contact surfaces between the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the first retaining structures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as well as the second retaining structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are reliably sealed by mechanical force created by the deformation of the metal-fittings <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and do not rely on any kind of glue Further, as the natural state of the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is to be open, the only compression force occurs during operation. The pi-shaped reinforced metal-fittings <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are provided to create not only the contacting forces between electrical contacts <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the first gas cathode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the second gas cathode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the contacting force of the tab portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the support structure <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to the conducting surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the anode conductor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, but also to distribute evenly the tightening force along the whole length of the top opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so that a more reliable seal is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A rubber sealing element <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is provided to avoid leakage of the electrolyte because the anode conductor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> should be installed through the first retaining structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Another elastic element <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is provided to create a force to ensure good contact of the anode conductor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the cathode conductor <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the next cell, as will be explained later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is the enlarged view of encircled area &ldquo;H&rdquo; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Elastic elements <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are seated in the second retaining structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to press tightly the tab portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) against the conducting surface <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the anode conductor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to ensure good electrical conductivity. Elastic elements <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be made with any elastic and alkaline-resist material, and preferably from the same material as the soft pocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
