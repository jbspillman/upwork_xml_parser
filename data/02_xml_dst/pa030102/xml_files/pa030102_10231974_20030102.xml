<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Programmable memory devices and methods for fabricating the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Typical memory applications include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static random access memory (SRAM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), and electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Solid state memory devices typically employ micro-electronic circuit elements for each memory bit (e.g., one to four transistors per bit) in memory applications. Since one or more electronic circuit elements are required for each memory bit, these devices may consume considerable chip &ldquo;real estate&rdquo; to store a bit of information, which limits the density of a memory chip. The primary &ldquo;non-volatile&rdquo; memory element of these devices, such as an EEPROM, typically employ a floating gate field effect transistor device that has limited re-programmability and which holds a charge on the gate of field effect transistor to store each memory bit. These classes of memory devices are also relatively slow to program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Phase change memory devices use phase change materials, i.e., materials that can be electrically switched between a generally amorphous and a generally crystalline state, for electronic memory application. One type of memory element developed by Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. of Troy, Michigan utilizes a phase change material that can be, in one application, electrically switched between a structural state of generally amorphous and generally crystalline local order or between different detectable states of local order across the entire spectrum between completely amorphous and completely crystalline states. Typical materials suitable for such application include those utilizing various chalcogenide elements. These electrical memory devices typically do not require field effect transistor select devices, and comprise, in the electrical context, a monolithic body of thin film chalcogenide material. As a result, very little chip real estate is required to store a bit of information, thereby providing for inherently high density memory chips. The state change materials are also truly non-volatile in that, when set in either a crystalline, semi-crystalline, amorphous, or semi-amorphous state representing a resistance value, that value is retained as that value represents a physical state of the material (e.g., crystalline or amorphous). Thus, phase change memory materials represent a significant improvement in non-volatile memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One characteristic common to solid state and phase change memory devices is significant power consumption particularly in setting or resetting memory elements. Power consumption is significant, particularly in portable devices that rely on power cells (e.g., batteries). It would be desirable to decrease the power consumption of a memory device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another characteristic common to solid state and phase-change memory devices is that they are formed on or in the top surface of a substrate. Solid state transistors formed in or on the top surface of a substrate have addressing circuitry overlying the top of the transistor. These devices generally require the use of the top surface of the substrate and are formed in a two dimensional array over the substrate surface.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a memory array comprised of a plurality of memory elements. Memory array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be incorporated for example, in a dedicated memory chip or as a memory component of a microprocessor. In this example, the circuit of memory array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an xyz grid with memory elements (representatively memory element <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) electrically interconnected in series with isolation devices (representatively isolation device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) in multiple layers (e.g., multiple planes) on a portion of a substrate such as a chip. Representatively, memory element <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and isolation device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are associated with layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a portion of a chip. Address lines <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (e.g., columns) and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (e.g., rows) for layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are connected, in one embodiment, to addressing circuitry external to the array to address respective ones of memory elements (e.g., memory element <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) of layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to, for example, read or write to the memory elements. The isolation devices (e.g., isolation device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) serve in one aspect to restrict electrical access to the memory elements. Layers <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be similarly arranged as layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with respective address lines <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> connected to the addressing circuitry. Additional memory elements, isolation elements and layers can be added in other embodiments. One purpose of the xyz grid array of memory elements in combination with isolation devices is to enable each discrete memory element to be read and written without interfering with the information stored in adjacent or remote memory elements of the array. Memory elements with different z coordinates (memory elements in different layers) are read from and written to by selecting row and column address lines from the appropriate layer (e.g. to select memory element <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> the x&plus;1 row of rows <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the y&plus;1 column of columns <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> are asserted). The addressing circuitry is connected to each layer and is configured to select the appropriate layer to access a given memory element. It is appreciated and it will become clearer later that each layer or plane (e.g., layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, layer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>), although represented in an xz plane, may have a y-dimension component as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-E illustrate the fabrication of representative memory element <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and isolation device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows a portion of substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> that is, for example, a semiconductor substrate. A typical substrate includes a semiconductor substrate such as a silicon substrate. In one embodiment, silicon substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has a thickness of 10 to 50 mils, for example 25 mils. Other substrates including, but not limited to, substrates that contain ceramic material, organic material, or glass material as part of the infrastructure are also suitable. Alternatively, substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be an insulator layer composed of an oxide (e.g., SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), nitride (e.g., Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), polymer (e.g., polymide), undoped polycrystalline silicon, undoped epitaxial silicon or other similar material. Memory array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be fabricated over an area of the substrate at the wafer level and then the wafer reduced through singulation into discrete die or chips, some or all of the die or chips having a memory array formed thereon. Additional addressing circuitry (e.g., decoders, etc.) may also be formed on a portion of substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, an overlying insulation layer may be formed on the substrate. The insulating film may have a thickness of 200-20,000 angstroms (&angst;), for example 5,000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a low resistivity conductor is formed as a layer on substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and is patterned to form row line conductors such as row line conductor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Row line conductor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be composed of patterned strips of polycrystalline silicon or polycrystalline silicon strapped with tungsten silicide (WSi<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>), cobalt silicide (CoSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), titanium silicide (T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>Si<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or similar low resistivity conductors. In one embodiment, the thickness of strapped polycrystalline silicon <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is 25 to 10,000 &angst;, for example, approximately 1500 &angst;. In one embodiment, polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is deposited at a temperature of approximately 600&deg; C. Deposition at this temperature should not affect other structures on substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> such as field effect transistors (e.g., NFETs and PFETs). The polycrystalline silicide strapping process is designed for low temperatures such as the 600&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> formed in a dielectric material on conductor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> serve to isolate individual memory elements from one another. In one embodiment, insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> are formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of an insulating layer such as an oxide over conductor layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and subsequently etched to create, in one embodiment, roughly cylindrical recesses in the layer using a chemical mechanical polish (CMP), photolithography and dry etching process or by using only photolithography and dry etching processes. In one embodiment, the thickness of the insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is in the range of 200 to 20,000 &angst;, 5,000 &angst;. The width of insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is 0.01-1 micrometers (&mgr;m), for example 0.20 &mgr;m. A representative aspect ratio of the insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is 2.5:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> shows the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> after a further fabrication operation in memory cell regions between insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Overlying conductor or signal line material <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is an isolation device (e.g., isolation device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). In one example, the isolation device is a diode formed by depositing polycrystalline silicon between insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> can be further recessed by CMP and dry etching or other suitable techniques. In one example, isolation device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is PN diode <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> formed of N-type silicon portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> (dopant concentration on the order of about 10<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>-10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>) and P-type silicon portion <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> (dopant concentration on the order of about 10<highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>-10<highlight><superscript>20 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>). Although a PN diode <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is shown, it is to be appreciated that other isolation structures are similarly suitable. Such devices include, but are not limited to, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices or metal-insulator-metal (MIM) devices. In one embodiment, the polycrystalline silicon layer of isolation device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is deposited by low pressure CVD at a temperature of 600&deg; C. using a SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas. In one embodiment, the leakage tolerance levels for the isolation device are sufficiently low to allow a distinctive read of the highest resistance state. To minimize effects of diode leakage, an array architecture may be optimized that partitions diode leakage in such a way that the leakage is sufficiently low to allow a distinctive read of the highest resistance state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>D, overlying the isolation device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In one example, electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is polycrystalline semiconductor material such as polycrystalline silicon. Other suitable materials include carbon and semi-metals such as transition metals including, but not limited to, titanium, titanium-tungsten (TiW), titanium nitride (TiN) and titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN). The introduction is conformal in the sense that electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is introduced along the side walls of insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and overlying isolation structure <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the example where electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is semiconductor material such as polycrystalline silicon, following or during the introduction of electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a dopant is introduced into the polycrystalline silicon to, in one aspect, lower the resistance of the material. In this example, a suitable dopant is a P-typed dopant such as boron introduced to a concentration on the order of about 10<highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>-10<highlight><superscript>20 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. In one embodiment, the dopant is introduced at an angle such that electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> along only a portion of the sidewalls of insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> (a first sidewall portion) is primarily exposed to the dopant while electrode material along another portion of the sidewall (a second sidewall portion) is exposed to little or no dopant. The sidewalls of the insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> define a cylindrical opening. In this manner, the resistance of electrode material along the first sidewall portion may be reduced below the resistance of electrode material along the second sidewall portion. In the case of polycrystalline silicon, in one example, electrode material along the second sidewall portion is substantially intrinsic silicon. Dopant introduction, such as an implantation, is done at an angle, &agr;, of approximately 60&deg; from horizontal to introduce a dopant (e.g., P-typed dopant) into electrode material along the first sidewall portion to the significant exclusion of electrode material along the second sidewall portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, electrode material along the first sidewall portion is counter-doped. A first dopant introduced along a portion of electrode material on the first sidewall portion (again at an angle) adjacent isolation structure <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is of a first type (e.g., P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type). A second dopant may be introduced at the top portion of electrode material along the first sidewall portion of a second type (e.g., N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type). In the example of P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type and N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type counter-doping, the different portions of electrode material along the first sidewall portion have different levels of charge carriers (e.g., N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type portion&gt;P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type portion). The difference in charge carriers generally modifies the resistance of the electrode so that the resistance of the electrode can be increased near that portion adjacent a volume of phase-change material. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/620,318, filed Jul. 22, 2000, titled &ldquo;Electrically Programmable Memory Element Having Sidewall Contact and Method for Making Same&rdquo; describes a counter-doped electrode material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> also shows the structure after the introduction of insulator material <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> overlaying the electrode material between insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and a planarization of electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, insulator material <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Suitable planarization techniques include those known to those of skill in the art, such as dry etching or CMP techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment a modifying species is introduced into a portion of electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> at the first sidewall portion. In one example, the modifying species is a chemical modifier that combines or reacts with electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to modify at least the resistivity of the electrode material. In the example where electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is polycrystalline silicon, the modifying species includes a chemical agent that reacts or combines with silicon such as carbon, nitrogen or oxygen. In one embodiment, the modification is an increase of the resistivity of the electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in the local region near the top of the sidewall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</cross-reference> shows the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> after the introduction of a volume of programmable material (represented as memory element <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) on electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> along the first sidewall portion of insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. In one example, programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is a phase change material. In a more specific example, programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> includes chalcogenides, examples of which include, but are not limited to, compositions of the class of tellurium-germanium-antimony (Te<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ge<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>Sb<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>) material. The volume of programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, in one example according to current technology, is introduced with a thickness on the order of about 600 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Overlying programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is signal line material that along with programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are patterned into strips representing reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as column lines. In one embodiment, the programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is patterned into strips that act as signal lines <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for the array. Programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> has a thickness in the range of 50 to 2000 &angst;, for example 600 &angst; thick. Signal lines <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are 50-20,000 &angst; wide, for example 1800 &angst; wide. A representative aspect ratio for programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and signal lines <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is 0.33. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a layer of programmable material is deposited on the insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and electrode material <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The layer is subsequently patterned such that the volume of programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> overlies (as viewed) or is on the modified portion of electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> along the first sidewall portion of insulating structures <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. A conductive material layer formed over programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and patterned to form a column address line or signal line <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, this column signal line is patterned to be generally orthogonal to row address line <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Column address or signal line <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may be composed of tungsten (W), aluminum (Al), an aluminum alloy or other similar conductive material. It is to be appreciated at this point that programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> may be patterned contiguously with second conductor or signal line material <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> such that programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is itself strips (like second conductor or signal line material <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>) or is in a cellular form (achieved by patterning prior to patterning second conductor or signal line material <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). The components of a memory element such as memory element <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</cross-reference> with a dotted line <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As used herein the terminology &ldquo;area of contact&rdquo; is the portion of the surface of an electrical contact through which the electrical contact electrically communicates with programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, substantially all electrical communication between programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> occurs through all or a portion of an edge of electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Hence, the area of contact between electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is an edge of electrode or a portion of an edge of the electrode. That is, the area of contact between electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is an &ldquo;edge portion&rdquo; of electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. It is noted that electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> need not actually physically contact programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. It is sufficient that electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is in electrical communication with programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The area of contact, being only an edge portion (i.e., an edge or a portion of an edge) of electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, is thus very small and is proportional to the thickness of electrode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Insulator material <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is, for example, SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or other suitable material that surrounds second conductor or signal line material <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and programmable material <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> to electronically isolate such structure. In one embodiment, following introduction, insulator material <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> is planarized. Techniques for introducing insulator material <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and planarizing are known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the above description of forming a memory element such as memory element <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an electrode is described between a programmable material and conductors or signal lines (e.g., row lines and column lines). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The discussion detailed the formation of one memory element of memory array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Other memory elements of memory array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be fabricated in the same manner. It is to be appreciated that many, and possibly all, memory elements of memory array <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, along with other integrated circuit circuitry, may be fabricated simultaneously on an initial layer. This sequence likewise can be repeated to form additional memory cell layers overlying this initial layer using insulation layer <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> as the base layer for the overlying layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, programming memory element <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (addressed by column line y&plus;1 of columns <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and row line x&plus;1 of rows x in layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) involves, in one example, supplying a voltage to column line y&plus;1 to introduce a current into the volume of memory material <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The current causes a temperature increase at the volume of memory material <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. To amorphize a volume of memory material, the volume of memory material is heated to a temperature beyond the amorphisizing temperature, T<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>(e.g., beyond the melting point of the memory material). A representative amorphisizing temperature for a Te<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ge<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>Sb<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>material is on the order of about 600-650&deg; C. Once a temperature beyond T<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>is reached, the volume of memory material is quenched or cooled rapidly (by removing the current flow). The quenching is accomplished at a rate, t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, that is faster than the rate at which the volume of memory material <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can crystallize so that the volume of memory material <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> retains its amorphous state. To crystallize a volume of memory material <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the temperature is raised by current flow to the crystallization temperature for the material (representatively a temperature between the glass transition temperature of the material and the melting point) and retained at that temperature for a sufficient time to crystallize the material. After such time, the volume of memory material is quenched (by removing the current flow). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a read operation is performed similar to a write operation at reduced energy levels to avoid changing stored data values with continuous read cycles. A small current or voltage is formed on the selected column with the selected row brought to a low voltage level. The voltage or current, respectively that develops is a measure of the memory element resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the preceding example, the volume of memory material <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> was heated to a high temperature to amorphisize the material and reset the memory element (e.g., program <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>). Heating the volume of memory material to a lower crystallization temperature crystallizes the material and sets the memory element (e.g., program <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). It is to be appreciated that the association of reset and set with amorphous and crystalline material, respectively, is a convention and that at least an opposite convention may be adopted. It is also to be appreciated from this example that the volume of memory material <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be partially set or reset by varying the current flow and duration through the volume of memory material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a cross section of a portion of one embodiment of memory device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> with multiple stacked layers <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>D.
