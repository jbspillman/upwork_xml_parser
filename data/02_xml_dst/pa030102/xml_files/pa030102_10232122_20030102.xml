<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. co-pending patent application entitled TIRE INFLATION ASSISTANCE MONITORING SYSTEM, Ser. No. 09/513,941, filed Feb. 28, 2000 (Attorney Docket DON01 P-801), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to vehicular function monitoring and display systems. More particularly, the invention is related to a system for assisting the manual inflating of tires while mounted on the wheels of a vehicle. Most particularly, this invention is related to a system for assisting the manual inflating of tires of the vehicle that includes an indicator assembly positioned on an exterior vehicle portion such as an exterior mirror assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Remote tire pressure sensors have been developed which sense tire pressure and transmit, such as via a radio frequency link, the tire pressure to a vehicle-based controller. The information regarding tire pressure may be used to control vehicle safety-based devices, such as ride and comfort control systems, road-handling systems, braking systems, and the like. It is also known to utilize such sensors in combination with tires that can run without inflation in order to warn the driver that the tire is operating in an emergency mode and should be driven at a limited speed for a limited distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is known to utilize various gauges and displays in view of the driver. For example, it is known to place a display of vehicle tire pressure within the interior cabin of the vehicle in view of the driver. This includes displaying the vehicle tire pressure in an interior mirror-based display. Typically, such displays mounted in the interior cabin provide a read-out of the inflation status of individual tires on the vehicle, such as an alphanumerical read-out of tire pressure or an icon indicative of tire pressure status. For example, a read-out or an icon indicative of the individual tire pressures at the four wheels on an automobile can be displayed at the reflective element of the interior rearview mirror assembly. While such displays alert the driver of the vehicle sitting in the interior vehicular cabin when the vehicle is operating as to the inflation status of individual tires present on the vehicle, they are little to no aid to a driver or other person while actually pumping air into or bleeding air from an individual tire in response to recognition of an undesired tire inflation pressure. While pumping air into or bleeding air from a tire mounted on a vehicle (such as commonly occurs at service stations and the like), a person typically uses an air line connected to an air compressor. The air line is manually connected to an inflation valve provided at the vehicular tire; the person presses the air line to a nipple of the tire valve, and, by so doing, pressurized air is allowed pass through the tire valve, or escape from the tire valve, to inflate or deflate tire pressure to the desired pressure value. To so do, typically the engine is turned off and the driver exits the vehicle, and crouches down at a particular wheel on a side of the vehicle in order to adjust the tire pressure at that particular wheel. While so doing, the driver typically does not have a view of the vehicle interior, and typically relies on a hand-held tire pressure gauge or on a gauge provided on the air line used for tire pressure adjustment. Thus, even though the vehicle tire may be equipped with a sensor for measuring the air pressure in the tire, in systems known to date, this tire pressure monitoring sensor does not provide a readily readable indication of correct or incorrect tire inflation pressure to the person external to the vehicle who is adjusting the tire pressure in that tire on the vehicle, and especially while that person is in the act of adjusting that tire pressure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a new and useful system that provides an indicator external of the vehicle to indicate the inflation condition of the vehicle tires. The present invention provides a readily interpretable indication of correct or incorrect tire inflation pressure to a person external to the vehicle who is adjusting the tire pressure in that tire on the vehicle, and especially while that person is in the act of adjusting that tire pressure. Preferably, the indicator is positioned at an exterior vehicle portion, such as a vehicle exterior rearview mirror assembly, where the indicator can be observed by a user inflating or deflating the vehicle tires located at the vehicle side of that exterior vehicle portion. However, the present invention may also be used as a convenient indicator to the driver or passenger entering a vehicle that one or more of the vehicle tires are in an under-pressure or over-pressure condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a tire inflation monitoring system suitable for use on a vehicle is provided that comprises at least one tire inflation indicator assembly positioned at an exterior vehicle portion at a side of the vehicle and visible exterior the vehicle. The at least one tire inflation indicator assembly provides an indication of the inflation condition of at least one vehicle tire positioned at that side of the vehicle, and wherein the tire inflation monitoring system includes a control receiving at least one input from at least one tire pressure sensor sensing pressure of the at least one vehicle tire, and the control producing an output to illuminate the at least one tire inflation indicator assembly in response to a tire pressure condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A vehicle exterior rearview mirror system, according to an aspect of the invention, includes at least one exterior rearview mirror assembly mounted on a side of the vehicle. The exterior rearview mirror assembly includes a reflective element and a support for the reflective element. The system further includes a tire inflation monitor including at least one tire inflation indicator assembly positioned at the exterior rearview mirror assembly and visible exterior of the vehicle. The at least one indicator assembly provides an indication of the inflation condition of at least one of the vehicle tires mounted to wheels of the vehicle on the side of the vehicle to which the exterior mirror assembly is mounted. The tire inflation monitor includes a control receiving at least one input from at least one tire pressure sensor sensing pressure of at least one of the vehicle tires. The tire inflation monitor further includes a control producing an output to illuminate the at least one tire inflation indicator assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> By providing a tire inflation monitor visible exterior of the vehicle, the present invention provides an indication to a vehicle user at a desirable location that provides a useful assistance to the user, or an attendant, inflating the vehicle tires. This is accomplished by providing a tire inflation indicator at the exterior rearview mirror assembly in order to be visible at the vehicle tires. As the vehicle tires are inflated from an under-pressure to an operating pressure range, the indicator provides an indication of this change. The indicator may also provide an indication when the tires are inflated to an over-inflated condition. The invention also provides a useful indication as the driver enters the vehicle or exits the vehicle that attention to the tires is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, advantages, and features of this invention will become apparent upon review of the following specification in conjunction with the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring now specifically to the drawings, and the illustrative embodiments depicted therein, a vehicle exterior rearview mirror system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use with vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes one or more exterior rearview mirror assemblies <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a tire inflation monitoring system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). Tire inflation monitoring system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes at least one tire pressure indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> positioned at exterior rearview mirror assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and one or more tire pressure sensors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, each associated with one of the vehicle tires. Each tire pressure sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected wirelessly with control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by a wireless communication link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that, in the illustrated embodiment, is a radio frequency (RF) link. Tire pressure sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is commercially available from several sources and conventionally includes a wireless communication link <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a vehicle controller. Control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is an electronic control, and is preferably a microprocessor-based electronic control, but may, alternatively, be a digital logic controller, an analog controller, or the like. Preferably, control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> performs additional vehicle functions. Most preferably, control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is interconnected with a vehicle serial bus system such as of the type disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,959,367, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Exterior rearview mirror assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a reflective element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a support <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> supporting the reflective element by vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). As is conventional, support <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a fixed portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> attached to vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a movable portion (not shown) which movably supports reflective element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the movable portion is an electrically controlled actuator of the type disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/228,348, filed Jan. 11, 1999, by Schnell et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Reflective element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be any of several reflectors such as glass coated on its first or second surface with a suitable reflective layer or layers, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,179,471, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, or, preferably, an electro-optic reflective element, and, most preferably, an electrochromic mirror element. However, the invention applies to all forms of reflective element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Electrochromic reflective elements <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be of any type such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,108 issued to Byker; commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,663 issued to Varaprasad et al.; commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,187 issued to Varaprasad et al; commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,002,511 issued to Varaprasad et al.; commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,140,455 issued to Varaprasad et al.; commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,910,854 issued to Varaprasad et al. and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/429,643, filed Apr. 27, 1995, by Varaprasad et al., entitled ELECTROCHROMIC MIRRORS AND DEVICES, the disclosures of which are hereby all incorporated herein by reference. Electrochromic reflective elements <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> include electrochromic units, or cells, that decrease in transmissivity in response to a drive signal applied thereto. Most preferably, reflective element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises a front substrate and a rear substrate with an electrochromic medium disposed between, such as a solid polymer matrix electrochromic medium such as is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/350,930, filed Jul. 12, 1999, entitled ELECTROCHROMIC POLYMERIC SOLID FILMS, MANUFACTURING ELECTROCHROMIC DEVICES USING SUCH FILMS, AND PROCESSES FOR MAKING SUCH SOLID FILMS AND DEVICES, to Desaraju V. Varaprasad et al., the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Most preferably, the front substrate comprises a glass plate of thickness less than about 1.6 mm, most preferably about 1.1 mm thickness or lower, and the rear substrate comprises a glass plate of thickness equal to or greater than about 1.6 mm, more preferably greater than about 1.8 mm thickness, most preferably equal to or greater than about 2.0 mm thickness. The rearmost surface of the rear substrate (the fourth surface as known in the mirror art) is reflector coated with a high reflecting metal film such as of aluminum or silver, or an alloy of aluminum or silver. Most preferably, the frontmost surface of the rear substrate (the third surface as known in the mirror art) is reflector coated with a high reflecting metal film such as of aluminum or silver, or an alloy of aluminum or silver, optionally overcoated with a transparent electronic conductor coating such as of indium tin oxide or of doped tin oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Exterior rearview mirror assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may include other elements and functions as disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,475; 5,371,659; 5,971,552; and 5,497,306, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> preferably generates a pattern of light P viewable from the location of the tires of the vehicle on the side of the vehicle with which tire pressure sensors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are associated. In this manner, a user of the vehicle or an attendant or mechanic may inflate the vehicle tires while observing the pattern of light P generated by the tire pressure indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. This may be accomplished by mounting tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to a lower surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the portion of exterior rearview mirror assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that houses the mirror reflector. In addition to producing a pattern of light P, which is visible at the tires on the side of the vehicle with which the associated tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is located, the pattern of light P preferably will not be substantially visible to the driver of the vehicle. This avoids any distraction to the driver from the tire inflation indicator assembly while the driver is in the vehicle. Furthermore, there is less wind noise below the exterior rearview mirror assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, the presence of the tire pressure indicator assembly there does not substantially contribute to wind noise generated by the exterior rearview mirror assembly. Furthermore, the bottom portion of exterior rearview mirror assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is typically hollow and provides a convenient attachment point for the tire inflation indicator assembly. Because the exterior mirror assembly protrudes outwardly from the vehicle body, locating the tire inflation indicator assembly at the exterior mirror assembly, and especially at a lower portion of the part of the exterior mirror assembly that houses the mirror reflector element, is advantageous. This is because such a location renders the indicator of the tire inflation indicator assembly readily visible to a person positioned at either or both of the front wheel tire and the rear wheel tire of the vehicle who is inflating/deflating a tire, and especially when the person adjusting the tire pressure is crouched down at a vehicle wheel tire while manually adjusting its tire pressure. For example, a tire inflation indicator assembly that includes a light source, such as a light-emitting diode, can protrude from the underside of the casing part of the exterior mirror assembly that houses the mirror reflector element. Thus, whether the user adjusting tire pressure is located at a front wheel tire or a rear wheel tire at one of the driver side or the passenger side of the vehicle, the user can see a single indicator of the tire inflation indicator assembly that is positioned below the casing of the exterior mirror assembly on that side, and that preferably protrudes therefrom (for example, as a pendant element), as he or she crouches down at that particular wheel tire on that particular vehicle side. It is preferable, for economy, that a single tire inflation indicator assembly be provided on an exterior vehicle portion of a side of the vehicle at a location visible to a person inflating either a front wheel tire of that side or a rear wheel tire of that side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, a tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be positioned at fixed portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of support <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is illustrated on a surface directed rearwardly of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> where it would generate a pattern of light visible at a rear tire of the vehicle on the side of the vehicle on which tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is located. Another tire inflation indicator assembly (not shown) may be positioned on a forward-facing portion of fixed portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, thereby being visible at the area around the forward tire on the same side of the vehicle on which the tire inflation assembly is located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In another alternative embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is positioned with the movable portion of support <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, such as on reflective element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Preferably, tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is positioned behind reflective element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, thereby protected from environmental elements such as road splash, car washes, and the like. This is accomplished by removing a portion of a reflective coating on reflective element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such that tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is viewable through reflective element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (or by using a semitransparent mirror reflector such a dichroic mirror element such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,361,190, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein). Tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be joined with reflective element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> according to the principles disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,313, entitled DISPLAY FOR AUTOMATIC REARVIEW MIRROR, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Other mountings for tire inflation indicator assembly, according to the invention, may be apparent to the skilled artisan. For example, the tire inflation indicator assembly may be mounted at the sail portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of exterior rearview member assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or a portion of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adjacent to exterior rearview mirror assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Also, the tire inflation indicator assembly can be located at an exterior vehicle portion other than at the exterior mirror assembly. For example, a tire inflation indicator assembly can be located at a vehicle body side panel, such as at or part of a side marker assembly, or as part of a door panel assembly. Optionally, a tire inflation indicator assembly can be located at each wheel tire location, so that a person inflating or deflating a particular tire can see the indicator of tire pressure local to the particular wheel tire being inflated/deflated. Other elements may be combined with the tire inflation indicator assembly. For example, a temperature sensor for sensing the exterior temperature surrounding the vehicle may be positioned in a common housing with the tire inflation indicator assembly. Furthermore, the tire inflation indicator assembly may be positioned at a side-mounted camera assembly for a rearview camera vision system of the type disclosed in commonly assigned International Publication WO 96/38319, published Dec. 5, 1996, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Tire inflation indicator system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> optionally comprises a lockout <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> that prevents inadvertent actuation of tire inflation indicator assemblies <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> during operation of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Such lockouts are conventional and preferably comprise a circuit that is responsive to the vehicle being placed in gear to the vehicle reaching a determined speed (such as at least 5 miles per hour), or to turning an ignition switch to operate the engine. When the lockout circuit senses that the vehicle is operating or in a condition to operate, operation of tire inflation indicator assemblies <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is optionally disabled. Thus, receipt of an input indicative of operation of the vehicle by tire pressure monitoring controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from lockout <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> would disable operation of tire inflation indicator assemblies <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Thus, and optionally, control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> processes the input <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in order to lock out illumination of tire inflation indicator assemblies <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> during operation of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This further reduces the likelihood of the tire inflation monitoring system providing a distraction not only to the driver of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during normal driving of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but also to operators of vehicles in the vicinity of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Tire inflation monitoring system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may additionally receive an input <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> indicative of the locked state of the vehicle doors. Preferably, control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides outputs to illuminate tire inflation indicator assemblies <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> only when the vehicle doors are in an unlocked state, which is likely when the tires of the vehicle are being inflated. Most preferably, control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is capable of illuminating tire inflation indicator assemblies <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in response to a sensed tire inflation condition only for a predetermined period of time after door lock input <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> indicates that the vehicle doors have changed to an unlocked state and, optionally and preferably, after ignition sensing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> indicates that the vehicle ignition is not operating (i.e., the engine is off). This period of time, which is determined by timeout <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, may be less than or equal to about two hours and, preferably, less than or equal to about 30 minutes. Most preferably, this predetermined period of time is less than or equal to about 15 minutes. Control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may additionally produce outputs to illuminate tire inflation indicator assemblies <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in response to a tire pressure sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> sensing commencement of a manual tire pressure adjust event such as by sensing a change in pressure of its associated tire indicative of a user of the vehicle inflating/deflating that tire, or sensing depression of the close-out nipple provided in the tire valve stem to allow connection to an air hose/to allow bleed off of tire pressure. In this manner, the tire inflation indicator assembly is illuminated when it is of assistance to the manual inflation of the tires. The tire inflation assembly may stay capable of illumination after a given event (such as unlocking a door, opening a door, turning off the vehicle ignition, detection of an indication of a manual tire pressure adjust event) for a predetermined period of time which, for example, is less than or equal to about two hours and, preferably, is less than or equal to about 30 minutes and, most preferably, is less than or equal to about 15 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Provision of door lock input <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and/or ignition sensing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or timeout <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is advantageous towards ensuring that the tire inflation indicator system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> remains armed and powered for a sufficient time period to allow the driver to pull up to a service station to service tire pressures, but not so that the tire inflation indicator system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> would remain powered and armed all the time a vehicle is parked (and thus risk depleting the vehicle battery which typically operates at 12 volts nominal). Since sensors <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and other electronic elements of system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> require electric power to operate, and since when stopped at a service station it is usual and safest to turn off the vehicle ignition while attending to the tire pressures, tire inflation indicator system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> typically will operate on vehicle battery power while the driver is inflating/deflating tires on wheels mounted to the vehicle, and so system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a battery depletion protection to obviate running down the battery when the vehicle is normally parked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Tire inflation indicator system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> optionally comprises a tire pressure adjust sensor <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> that provides an input to controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> alerting that a manual tire pressure adjust event is beginning. Thus, for example, when the vehicle is parked, tire inflation indicator system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> optionally remains in a quiescent, armed mode (that draws very little current from the vehicle battery, with a current draw of less than about 15 milliamps preferred, a current draw of less than about 10 milliamps more preferred, and a current draw of less than about 5 milliamps most preferred). Thus, even when prolonged parked, tire inflation indicator system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is powered but active only in a monitoring, low-current state, and with controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> monitoring an input from tire pressure adjust sensor <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. When a manual tire pressure adjust event is detected by tire pressure adjust sensor <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> (such as by detection of depression of the close-off nipple in the valve stem at the particular wheel tire at a side of the vehicle a person is manually inflating from a compressed air line, or by detection of a change in tire pressure indicative of a user-actuated tire inflate/deflate event), controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> activates the appropriate tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> on that particular vehicle side in order to indicate to the person attending to the tire, who typically is crouching down at the wheel tire, the tire pressure status in that particular tire. Since significant current consumption is typically only required by the indicator light sources themselves, use of tire pressure adjust sensor <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> can allow system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be in an armed but low power state continually and with the vehicle parked and the vehicle ignition turned off so that vehicle battery power alone is provided to system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Once tire pressure adjust sensor <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> detects that the tire adjust event is complete and/or timeout <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> times-out, any illumination of indicator(s) <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can cease, and system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can revert to its quiescent, low current consumption state (and so minimize depletion of vehicle battery charge). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Note also that an interior cabin display of tire pressure status (such as via a display at a location within the vehicle interior cabin such as at or on the interior rearview mirror assembly) can optionally be provided as part of system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, most preferably though only when ignition sensing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> indicates that the vehicle ignition is operational and the engine is running. Thus, when operating the vehicle while driving on the highway, or when stopped with the engine running, the driver can view a display located in the interior cabin that alerts as to tire pressure status at the individual vehicle wheels. When the driver determines that the tire pressure at a particular wheel needs adjustment, he or she can drive to a service station or the like, stop at an air compressor, preferably (for safety) turn off the engine, and exit the vehicle to manually inflate/deflate the particular tire, while aided by the tire inflation assistance monitoring system of this present invention. Alternately, the driver can remain in the vehicle, and have a service attendant manually inflate/deflate the particular tire, while aided by the tire inflation assistance monitoring system of this present invention. Provision of the tire inflation assistance monitoring system of this present invention as an additional feature to an interior vehicle cabin tire pressure status displaying system is a significant enhancement to such a system, and it can be added economically, given that many of the components, such as tire pressure sensors, wireless transmission transmitter/receivers and the like, are already existing in the interior vehicle cabin tire pressure status displaying system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of different colored indicators or lamps in order to indicate various inflation conditions of the tires of vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Such indicators can be coded (such as by color coding, intensity coding, frequency of flash coding, sequence coding, positional coding or the like) in order to signal to the driver when the tire pressure is below, at, or above the desired tire pressure. For example, one such indicator may be a green indicator which indicates that the pressure of the monitored tire or tires is within an acceptable pressure range, such as recommended by the manufacturer of the vehicle. A red indicator may illuminate when the pressure monitored by pressure sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is less than that recommended by the vehicle operator. The red indicator may flash when the pressure sensed by a pressure sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is greater than the range of pressures recommended by the vehicle manufacturer. Preferably, tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> includes a single color indicator in order to reduce the cost thereof. The single color indicator may, for example, be a green indicator which is illuminated in a steady fashion when the pressure sensed by tire pressure sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is within an acceptable range recommended by the vehicle manufacturer and flashing when outside of that range. Preferably, the indicator may flash at a first rate, such as at a relatively slow rate, when the pressure sensed by the pressure sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is less than the range recommended by the vehicle manufacturer and at a faster rate when the pressure sensed by sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is above the range recommended by the vehicle manufacturer. This single color indicator could be in an OFF condition during inflation of the tire until the inflation condition reaches the normal operating range recommended by the vehicle manufacturer. Other lamp operation protocols may suggest themselves to the skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Preferably, tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> includes one or more light-emitting light sources, such as solid-state light emitting diodes (LED), available from numerous sources. Various colors of LED can be used (or combined) such as blue, white, orange, yellow, red, amber and red-orange. Alternatively, the tire inflation indicator may be supplied as a conventional incandescent light source, a halogen light source, a fluorescent light source such as a vacuum fluorescent lamp, a light pipe such as fiber-optic bundle forming a light pipe, and the like. Most preferably, illumination by the tire inflation indicator is achieved using non-incandescent light sources, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), organic light-emitting material, electroluminescent sources (both organic and inorganic), and the like, and most preferably such non-incandescent sources are low power and are directed sources, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,938,321 and co-pending application entitled INTERIOR MIRROR ASSEMBLY FOR A VEHICLE INCORPORATING A SOLID-STATE LIGHT SOURCE, Ser. No. 09/287,926, filed Apr. 7, 1999, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, and in such as is disclosed in co-pending and co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/466,010, filed Dec. 17, 1999, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, and in co-pending and co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/449,121, filed Nov. 24, 1999, entitled REARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY WITH UTILITY FUNCTIONS, by Barry W. Hutzel et al. of Donnelly Corporation, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The light source of tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can include a lens, which may be supplied as a segmented lens, a prismatic lens, or a Fresnel lens, which may be clear or tinted, and may be provided over such light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Other modifications may include providing an input <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from a vehicle keyless entry system. Control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may respond to input <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by providing outputs to illuminate tire inflation indicators <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> upon the user operating the keyless entry system to unlock the doors. The control <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> would preferably illuminate tire inflation indicator assemblies <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> upon actuation of the keyless entry system until the outputs to the tire inflation indicator assemblies are locked out by receiving an input <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> indicating that the vehicle is operating and/or until after a predetermined time interval, determined by timeout <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, has elapsed. Although the invention is illustrated in use with an exterior vehicle portion such as exterior rearview mirror assemblies, a tire inflation indicator assembly, according to the invention, could also be positioned within the interior cabin of the vehicle, such as at a vehicle interior rearview mirror assembly <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), or at an inner cabin roof portion such as a header console <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight>, or at an instrumentation panel <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, or the like. However, this is less preferred as an interior cabin portion such as the interior mirror assembly is not as readily visible to a person inflating a tire mounted on a vehicular wheel (as compared to mounting the indicator of the tire inflation indicator assembly on an exterior vehicle portion such as an exterior side view mirror assembly, or at/on a side marker turn indicator, or at/on an exterior side body panel such as a door panel, wheel well, fender portion or at/on a door handle assembly or the like). Also, the tire inflation indicator assembly can optionally be provided as part of the vehicle wheel assembly itself. For example, the valve provided at the wheel tire to inflate the tire can include a tire inflation indicator assembly (such as a non-incandescent light emitting source such as an electroluminescent source (organic or inorganic) or a light-emitting diode) which has a light emission coded to the inflation status of the tire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Also, the tire inflation indicator assembly, according to the invention, can be mounted at, or combined with, a light assembly already present on an exterior vehicle portion such as a mirror-mounted turn signal or a side marker turn signal or an exterior mirror-mounted security light. Thus, for example, a side marker turn signal light source present on the side body panel for the purpose of signaling a lane change when a turn signal stalk in the interior vehicle cabin is actuated can also serve the dual purpose of acting as the tire inflation indicator for the tire inflation indicator assembly, according to the invention, and with the inflation status being indicated to the person inflating a tire on the side of the vehicle on which the side marker turn signal is mounted by flashing the turn signal to a code pattern determined and understood to signal a below-desired tire pressure state, a desired tire pressure state, and/or an overly inflated tire pressure state. Likewise, a mirror-mounted signal light or a security light, such as are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,669,704, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, can be similarly used for dual-purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Optionally, an audible tire inflation indicator can be provided in addition to (or as an alternate to) the visible tire inflation indicators described above for the tire inflation monitoring systems of the present invention. Thus, and referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, tire inflation indicator system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is similar to tire inflation indicator system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> described above. Thus, tire inflation indicator system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> includes a tire pressure monitoring controller <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (that typically includes an antenna, a microprocessor and associated electronic circuitry and that preferably includes user actuation/manual input elements such as switches or buttons or voice actuated input elements that allow a driver select, for example, a particular tire for display of its tire pressure or change the display from Imperial units to Metric units or enter a &ldquo;training&rdquo; mode whereby the driver can identify to the controller the location of a tire sensor on a particular wheel of the vehicle so that, during, for example, a tire rotation, the controller can learn which sensor is on what wheel such as by, for example, the driver &ldquo;burping&rdquo; tire pressure on a particular identified wheel such as the front passenger-side wheel when the system is in &ldquo;learning&rdquo; mode so that the controller can associate that particular wireless broadcast signal with that particular wheel) that receives tire pressure level input signals <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(preferably via short-range RF wireless transmission and most preferably in accordance with the BLUETOOTH protocol) from tire pressure sensors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>located, respectively, within the pressurized cavity of the front passenger-side tire, the front driver-side tire, the rear passenger-side tire and the rear driver-side tire (said tires mounted onto the respective wheels of a vehicle). System <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is optionally, and preferably provided with at least one of lockout <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, door lock status input <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, ignition sensing circuit <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, timeout <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, and tire pressure adjust sensor <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> (preferably, one such tire pressure adjust sensors at each wheel of the vehicle). System <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> also preferably includes visible exterior passenger-side mounted tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> (preferably a passenger-side exterior side view mirror-mounted visible mounted tire inflation indicator) and visible exterior driver-side mounted tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>&prime; (preferably a driver-side exterior side view mirror-mounted visible mounted tire inflation indicator) that operates as described above. System <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> also includes audible tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. Audible tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> can be of several types. For example, audible tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> can comprise a sound-generating microchip or similar solid-state sound or audible tone generating element that is part of tire pressure sensors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and that &ldquo;chirps&rdquo; or sounds or otherwise gives an audible sound coded to the state of inflation of the tire while air is being pumped in or bled out by a driver or service attendant during a tire inflation/deflation event such as at an air pump at a service station. The tone or audible signature of audible tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> can signal to the driver or service attendant, while that person is in the act of adjusting air pressure of a particular tire on a vehicle such as at a service station, whether the instantaneous tire pressure of the particular tire being serviced is at, below or above the tire pressure recommended for that particular tire on that particular model vehicle (and optionally, at the particular ambient temperature and/or vehicle load at which the tire pressure adjust event is occurring). Note that where a solid-state sound generator is used as audible tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, and where it is incorporated as part of a tire pressure sensor that is located within the pressurized-air tire cavity of a vehicular wheel, then audible tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> can optionally, and preferably, operate as part of the tire pressure sensor itself without a need for wireless transmission to and from an interior cabin-mounted controller <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the tire sensor, the audible tire inflation indicator and the controller are collocated as part of the same tire cavity-mounted tire pressure sensing module. Alternately, audible tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> can comprise the vehicle horn. In such an embodiment, and while the person is actually adjusting the tire pressure on a particular tire when external to the vehicle (and typically crouched down at that particular wheel being serviced and preferably with the vehicle ignition turned off), a wheel-mounted tire pressure sensor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(taking the example where the person is outside the vehicle adjusting the tire pressure of the front passenger-side wheel) transmits a wireless signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is received at vehicle tire pressure monitoring controller <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that is preferably located within the interior cabin of the vehicle (preferably at, on, or within an interior rearview mirror assembly or at, on or within a display assembly such as a flip-down video display assembly, as described below). Controller <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> processes signal <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and determines whether the tire pressure being sensed by tire sensor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is below, at, or above the tire pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer/tire manufacturer for that particular model/type of tire on that particular model vehicle (optionally taking into account the ambient temperature the vehicle is operating in and the load in the vehicle, such as might be determined by sensors associated with and sensing the vehicle suspension system). Dependent on the tire pressure sensed, controller <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> causes the circuitry controlling the vehicle horn to cause the horn to sound an audible signal or pattern of sounds that signal to the person adjusting the front passenger-side tire pressure that that tire is below, above and/or at the desired tire pressure recommended for that particular tire, and that audibly guide or prompt that person to pump more air in or bleed air out in order to adjust that tire&apos;s pressure to the correct pressure level, for example, 35 psi (pounds per square inch). In addition, and optionally and preferably, visual passenger-side tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can visually signal the instantaneous tire pressure being sensed at the front passenger-side wheel as its tire pressure is being adjusted. To avoid distracting or perturbing others in the vicinity, the sound level emitted by the car horn when functioning as an audible tire pressure indicator can be reduced in level from that normal for the horn, and it can also be of a sound pattern distinctive to a particular brand of vehicle/automaker so that a person adjusting tire pressure on his or her vehicle can identify and distinguish the audible tire pressure adjust signal of that person&apos;s vehicle from other audible signals from other vehicles, including from any other audible tire pressure indicator device-equipped vehicle that happens to be undergoing a tire pressure adjust in the immediate vicinity (a relatively rare/unlikely event given that most service stations have only one air hose provide to pump air into customers&apos; tires). Other locations for audible tire inflation indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> are possible on a vehicle such as a sound/tone generator located in either of, or both of, the driver-side and passenger-side exterior side view mirror assemblies and/or in any of the door handle assemblies of the vehicle or in an engine compartment or in a trunk compartment or in a side door panel or in a wheel well or in a body panel of the vehicle. Note that in the context of the present invention, an audible tire pressure indicator comprises a sound device that generates a sound pattern audible to a person outside the vehicle while that person is undertaking a tire pressure adjustment of a tire on a wheel mounted on the vehicle (such as with an air hose from a pressurized air pump such as at a service station), and such that the audible sound indicator encompasses generating an audible sound that indicates to the person adjusting the tire pressure that the tire pressure is at, below and/or above a recommended level for that tire on that vehicle, and as known to the vehicle tire pressure monitoring controller (typically stored in an electronic storage element thereof) of the vehicle tire pressure monitoring system. Note also that in the context of the present invention, a visible or visual tire pressure indicator comprises a light emitting light source (such as a light emitting diode or an incandescent source or a fluorescent source or an electroluminescent source) that, when powered, emits a light pattern visible to a person outside the vehicle while that person is undertaking a tire pressure adjustment of a tire on a wheel mounted on the vehicle (such as with an air hose from a pressurized air pump such as at a service station), and such that the visual or visible tire pressure indicator encompasses generating a light that indicates to the person adjusting the tire pressure that the tire pressure is at, below and/or above a recommended level for that tire on that vehicle, and as known to the vehicle tire pressure monitoring controller (typically stored in an electronic storage element thereof) of the vehicle tire pressure monitoring system. An audible tire pressure indicator device can be located anywhere in the vehicle such as in the vehicle interior cabin, in an engine compartment, in a trunk compartment, in a body panel, or in a vehicular accessory (such as an interior mirror assembly or an exterior mirror assembly or a door handle assembly or a console assembly), but is preferably located exterior to the interior cabin of the vehicle (so as to be more readily audible to a person outside the vehicle in the act of adjusting tire pressure). A visible or visual tire pressure indicator device can be located in an interior portion of the vehicle (such as at, on, within or adjacent an interior mirror assembly or a header console assembly or a dome light assembly) or at an exterior portion of the vehicle (such as at, within or adjacent an exterior side view mirror assembly or a door handle assembly), but preferably at a location readily visible to a person outside crouched at a wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Also, in any of the above embodiments, a tire pressure sensor can be located in a spare tire of the vehicle, and the spare tire pressure can be adjusted aided by the audible and/or visible and/or tactile tire pressure inflation status indicators of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Also, optionally, the tire pressure sensor located in each tire on the vehicle can include a solid-state vibrator or trembler (such as the vibration devices common on pagers and cell phones that provide a vibration indication of receipt of a call or of a message, as known in the art). Thus, when, for example, a tire pressure sensor at a particular wheel senses that the tire pressure in that particular tire is at (or close to) the recommended or desired tire pressure, then the air inlet/outlet valve or stalk or valve stem to which an air hose connects is caused to vibrate, by (referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) vibrator elements <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(that are respectively associated with the tire pressure sensor/air inlet valve of the front wheel tires and the rear wheel tires), and thus indicate to a person in the act of a tire pressure adjust that the tire pressure is at (or close to at) the desired tire pressure. Such trembler or vibrator can be configured only to operate when an actual tire pressure adjust event is occurring (such as only being active when tire pressure is rapidly changing such as might indicate (and be characteristic of) a tire pressure adjust event occurring, or when the nipple in the valve stem is depressed). Thus for example, should an air hose be connected to the valve stem that allows inflation/deflation of a tire on a wheel equipped with a tire sensor of this invention that includes a vibrator element, then, upon recognition that a tire adjust event is occurring (such as by detection or depression of the tire inlet nipple and/or by detection of a rapid rate of change of air pressure), the tire pressure sensor determines whether the instantaneous tire pressure is above or below the desired, pre-determined tire pressure level recommended for that tire on that vehicle, and upon detecting (for example) that tire pressure is higher than desired, the tire pressure sensor causes its in-built vibrator to vibrate or tremble which in turn causes the valve stem to tremble. Since the person adjusting the tire pressure is holding the nozzle of an air hose to that tire valve stem, that person will feel these vibrations, and knowing from the vehicle owner&apos;s manual that &ldquo;vibration&rdquo; means that &ldquo;tire pressure is too great&rdquo;, is instructed by the tactile feel of the nozzle on the nipple to deflate the tires. Once the correct tire pressure is reached, the vibrations cease, and upon feeling that the vibrations have ceased, the person can cease deflating the tire. If however the valve stem is not trembling or vibrating when the person first initiates a tire pressure adjust, the person knows (again from the vehicle owner&apos;s manual) that this signifies that the tire is under-inflated, and so the person is prompted to pump air in to inflate the tire, but to cease once a vibration or tremble in the valve stem is first felt, as this signifies that the air pressure in the tire has now reached the recommended pressure level. Different tactile codes can be envisaged that are indicative of tire pressure level in a tire while that tire is being inflated or deflated using an air hose from an air pump at a service station. The advantages of a tactile tire pressure indicator as described herein include that a module comprising the tire pressure sensing transducer, a tire pressure processor (preferably a microprocessor-based tire pressure monitor), a battery, associated circuitry, the inlet valve (including its stem and nipple), and the vibrator or tremble-generator can be provided as a sealed (preferred), unitary package that can be placed onto a wide variety of tire cavities on wheels, and without the necessity and/or expense of providing a wireless link to an in-cabin controller (although such is preferable when there is a desire to provide a vehicle tire pressure display to the driver while the driver is driving). Further, a tactile tire pressure indicator such as described herein such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> can be used in conjunction with a tire pressure display system that senses states of tire inflation or deflation by monitoring a performance characteristic of an ABS braking system on the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As described above, it is preferable that a display of tire pressure status be provided in the interior cabin of the vehicle (such as interior cabin tire pressure status display <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> of system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>) so that the driver, when operating the vehicle such as when driving down the highway, can check/be made aware of the tire pressure at any of the wheels on the vehicle. Note, and as described above, such interior cabin tire pressure displays are intended for use while driving the vehicle on a highway, and are normally not intended for use when the vehicle is stopped and with its ignition turned off, and are not normally adapted to be visible or useful to a person outside a vehicle and crouched down at a wheel in the act of making a tire pressure adjustment using an air hose as typically provided at a service station or the like. As described above, a preferred location for such an interior cabin tire pressure status display is at, on or within an interior mirror assembly of the vehicle.

For example, display element <highlight><bold>6849</bold></highlight> can display, in response to GPS system <highlight><bold>6854</bold></highlight>, the name of the next street or junction or highway entry/exit ramp being approached by the vehicle equipped with video mirror system <highlight><bold>6800</bold></highlight>. Accessory module <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight> is also equipped with a video camera <highlight><bold>6843</bold></highlight> for viewing a portion of the interior cabin (such as, for example, viewing a front passenger seat so as to function as a seat occupancy detector) and/or for viewing an occupant of the vehicle (such as a driver&apos;s head/face portion). Optionally, near-IR and/or visible light sources, as described previously, can be positioned at housing <highlight><bold>6859</bold></highlight> so as to illuminate the target area being viewed by camera <highlight><bold>6843</bold></highlight>. A forward facing camera <highlight><bold>6821</bold></highlight> is also provided at or within accessory module <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight> with a field of view through the front windshield (for automatic headlamp control and/or collision avoidance and/or windshield fogging detection and/or rain sensing and/or smart headlamp control). User actuatable controls <highlight><bold>6875</bold></highlight> are provided on the front portion of accessory housing <highlight><bold>6859</bold></highlight> to allow user actuation of a variety of vehicle functions and/or accessories (such as actuation of or color/tint control of video screen <highlight><bold>6831</bold></highlight>). A photo sensor <highlight><bold>6811</bold></highlight> (such as a photo diode, or a photo transistor, or a photo resistor) is provided to allow measurement of cabin ambient lighting for a variety of purposes, such as automatic intensity control of the video image displayed on video screen <highlight><bold>6831</bold></highlight>. An instrument panel/floor console/gear shift console illuminating light source <highlight><bold>6801</bold></highlight> (preferably an LED) is provided at the lower surface of accessory housing <highlight><bold>6859</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As seen in video mirror system <highlight><bold>6800</bold></highlight>, a stand-alone GPS and/or cellular phone and/or telematic system, including voice operated and voice recognizing systems, as well as other vehicle functions such as a keyless entry receiver, a map/reading light, an intrusion detector, a seat occupancy detector, a trainable/universal garage door opener, a rain sensor, a compass sensor, a headlamp controller, a twilight sentinel, a tool transceiver, a remote transaction transceiver, a windshield fogging detector as well as any other vehicle accessory described above, can be provided in a module assembly that attaches local to or at the attachment point in the vehicle where the interior mirror attaches (such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,930,742, entitled REARVIEW MIRROR AND ACCESSORY MOUNT FOR VEHICLES, to Kenneth Schofield et al., issued Jun. 5, 1990, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein) and in a manner that use can be made of the microphones and/or control buttons and/or other accessories in the accessory assembly without effecting the position of the mirror housing of the interior mirror assembly (and thereby the field of view of its reflective element), and preferably in a manner and at a location such that at least a portion, and preferably at least a substantial portion, of the accessory module is disposed behind the rear of the interior mirror housing of the interior rearview mirror assembly (and so in a region that minimizes obstruction of the driver&apos;s forward field of view through the front windshield). Thus, for example, a driver can dial a phone number or actuate a telematic control button in video mirror system <highlight><bold>6800</bold></highlight> without effecting the position of the mirror housing or otherwise perturbing the interior mirror assembly (the interior mirror assembly being separate from and independent of the accessory assembly). Also, the weight of the accessories, controls, microphones, antennae, circuitry, and the like in the accessory assembly is supported by the windshield mounting button/header mounting plate (or alternately, by a separate windshield attachment member/header attachment member as previously described) and not by the interior mirror assembly so that vibration of the mirror reflective element is unaffected. Also, by mounting the accessory assembly as in video mirror system <highlight><bold>6800</bold></highlight>, provision of a stand-alone telematic system and/or telecommunication/phone system (including a video phone system) and/or a GPS navigational system as an aftermarket/dealership option/OEM option item is facilitated. Note that variants of video mirror system <highlight><bold>6800</bold></highlight> are possible, such as where the accessory assembly is provided with pivot joints, as previously described, in order to allow positioning at a position and/or viewing angle desirable to a driver and/or occupant. Thus, for example, accessory housing <highlight><bold>6859</bold></highlight> of accessory module assembly <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight> can be movable about accessory module attachment portion <highlight><bold>6851</bold></highlight> so that the position of accessory module housing <highlight><bold>6859</bold></highlight> can be adjusted (about at least one axis, preferably about at least two axes, more preferably, about at least three axes) to position the user access/control buttons, information display and the like at the accessory housing <highlight><bold>6859</bold></highlight> at a location and/or a viewing angle desired/preferred by an occupant of the vehicle such as a driver or front seat passenger. Also, optionally and preferably, accessory module housing <highlight><bold>6859</bold></highlight> can be stowed as previously described when viewing of its information display and/or access to its control inputs is not desired. Thus, accessory module <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight> can comprise a flip-down accessory housing <highlight><bold>6859</bold></highlight> that is articulatable left to right and up and down. Also, when a cellular phone and/or a telematic device and/or a PDA and/or personal computing device is docked in or included in the accessory assembly <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight>, accessory assembly <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight> can include a loudspeaker (as described above) and associated sound amplification circuitry so that accessory module assembly <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight> functions as a stand-alone in-vehicle sound system, thus providing, for example, a speaker-phone function. Also, a passenger side inflatable restraint indicator display that indicates the state of activation/deactivation of an air bag or similar inflatable occupant restraint in the vehicle cabin (such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,953 to Jonathan E. DeLine et al., entitled REARVIEW MIRROR SUPPORT INCORPORATING VEHICLE INFORMATION DISPLAY, issued Jul. 11, 2000, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein) can be included in accessory assembly <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight> such as at information display <highlight><bold>6848</bold></highlight>. Also, accessory assembly <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight> can include various accessories and devices such as a seat occupancy detector (visible detector, ultrasound detector, radar detector, microwave detector, thermal detector (including a pyrodetector), infra red detector) and/or a keyless entry receiver and/or a cabin occupancy detector (such as a pyrodetector or an infra red detector or an ultrasound detector or an infra red detector) and/or a map light/reading light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of a video mirror system <highlight><bold>6800</bold></highlight>&prime; that includes components of (such as a controller that includes an antenna, a microprocessor, user-input controls, and/or allied electronic circuitry) and/or an information display of a tire pressure monitoring system and/or a tire pressure display system is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</cross-reference>. Video mirror system <highlight><bold>6800</bold></highlight>&prime; is similar in features and content to video mirror system <highlight><bold>6800</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, and comprises an interior mirror assembly <highlight><bold>6810</bold></highlight>&prime; and an accessory module assembly <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight>&prime;. Accessory module attachment portion <highlight><bold>6851</bold></highlight>&prime; of accessory module assembly <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight>&prime; attaches to windshield-mounted attachment member <highlight><bold>6820</bold></highlight>&prime; via a break-away mount that detaches when an impact at above a pre-determined impact force is experienced. Preferably, attachment member <highlight><bold>6820</bold></highlight>&prime; consists of a mirror mounting button such as is commonly found on the inner surface of vehicular windshields of MY00 vehicles such as from Ford Motor Company, Toyota Motors, BMW, General Motors Corporation, Volkswagen, Mazda, Daimler Chrysler Corporation, Nissan, Renault, Volvo, Audi and the like. Also, preferably, the receiving portion of accessory module attachment portion <highlight><bold>6851</bold></highlight>&prime; that attaches to windshield-mounted attachment member <highlight><bold>6820</bold></highlight>&prime; is the same as would be found on the mounting portion of an interior rearview mirror assembly that would attach to the windshield mounting button on the windshield of that particular vehicle model. This has several advantages. By making the mounting-to-the-windshield-button portion of accessory module assembly <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight>&prime; the same as that of the interior rearview mirror assembly that would normally attach to that particular type/construction of windshield-mounted mirror button, an automaker can supply an interior rearview mirror assembly and/or an accessory module assembly (with an interior mirror assembly mounting thereto) in accordance with the option(s) selected by a consumer ordering an individual vehicle. Also, dealership and after-market installation of an accessory module assembly is greatly facilitated. Only one mirror button need be mounted on the windshield (typically by the windshield manufacturer), although, optionally more than one attachment member can be adhered to the glass inner surface of the windshield, preferably with a substantially opaque black-out frit to mask the presence of such members when viewed from outside the vehicle through the front windshield. Also, because a mirror mount design is used for the attachment of accessory module attachment portion <highlight><bold>6851</bold></highlight>&prime; to the windshield-mounted attachment member <highlight><bold>6820</bold></highlight>&prime;, such attachment can be a break-away/detachable mounting that passes automaker and governmental safety standards and specifications for head impact, air-bag deployment, and the like, as well as being easy to install (such as at a vehicle assembly line) and/or to remove (such as during a service repair or the like) while maintaining a secure, reliable attachment during normal use for the vehicle lifetime. Also, a pivot joint <highlight><bold>6803</bold></highlight>&prime; (such as a ball joint similar to that commonly used on interior mirror assembly support arms, as described above) is provided on accessory module attachment portion <highlight><bold>6851</bold></highlight>&prime; so that should accessory module housing <highlight><bold>6859</bold></highlight>&prime; be impacted, such as in an accident, the housing moves away from the impacting body (such as an occupant&apos;s head), thus reducing potential injury. Thus, accessory module <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight>&prime; is adapted to meet automaker and regulatory head impact standards and specifications. Pivot joint <highlight><bold>6803</bold></highlight>&prime; also allows positioning of accessory housing <highlight><bold>6859</bold></highlight>&prime; to suit a driver&apos;s and/or occupant&apos;s needs, such as, for example, to position information display element <highlight><bold>6849</bold></highlight>&prime; for view by the driver and/or controls <highlight><bold>6876</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>6874</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>6875</bold></highlight>&prime; for ready access by the driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Also, and optionally, the accessory module assembly <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight> and the other flip-down, articulatable video display assemblies described above can be supported by an attachment member separate from the windshield-mounted or header-mounted mirror attachment button or plate. Examples of such separate mounting members are described above. A preferred adhesive to attach windshield mirror mounting buttons and/or windshield mounting attachment members for supporting an accessory module assembly or a video display assembly is a structural adhesive such as a modified epoxy structural bonding tape available from 3M of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn. under the trade names SBT9214, SBT9263 and SBT9270. Alternately, a silicone adhesive, such the silicone adhesive available from Dow Corning of Midland, Mich. under the trade name SOTEFA can be used or a polyvinyl butyral adhesive such as available from Solutia is can be used. For heavier video mirror systems/accessory module assemblies, such as those weighing in excess of 500 g and particularly in excess of 750 g, use of a structural bonding tape such as described above to bond the attachment member (such as the windshield mirror button) to the inner surface of the windshield is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Also, the video display in any of the video mirror/video display assemblies above, such as video mirror system <highlight><bold>6800</bold></highlight>, can function as the display screen for a portable computer device, a portable cellular phone, and/or a portable personal digital assistant device (PDA) such as a PalmPilot&reg; or other personal digital assistant. When serving as the display screen of a PDA, the PDA/in-vehicle display screen can optionally operate in combination with a cellular phone or as a stand-alone device. Also, any of the video display screens above, such as video display screen <highlight><bold>6831</bold></highlight>, can serve multiple purposes such as a video screen for an on-board vehicular camera and/or as the video monitor screen for a portable computing/PDA/cellular phone/telecommunication device in addition to, or as an alternative to, functioning as a display of a tire pressure display/monitoring system. For example, a removable telecommunication and/or computing accessory <highlight><bold>6827</bold></highlight> can be removably docked into docking station <highlight><bold>6828</bold></highlight> of accessory module <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight>. For example, and as described in disclosed in co-pending U.S. Pat. application entitled REARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY WITH UTILITY FUNCTIONS, filed by Barry W. Hutzel et al., on Jun. 1, 2000, which is incorporated herein in its entirety and in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/449,121, filed Nov. 24, 1999, entitled REARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY WITH UTILITY FUNCTIONS, by Barry W. Hutzel et al. of Donnelly Corporation, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, a cellular phone or a personal digital assistant device such as a PalmPilot&reg; or a pager or a hand-held communication device and the like can be removably attached to accessory module <highlight><bold>6812</bold></highlight>. Also, note that, optionally, any of the display assemblies (such as the flip down displays described above) of the present invention and/or the camera assemblies of the present invention can be detached and used remote from the vehicle (or hand-held in the vehicle) as part of a portable video device, portable computer monitor, portable PDA or portable navigation device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is seen that the present invention provides a tire inflation monitoring system which provides a useful adjunct to the inflation of the vehicle tires. Because the visible tire inflation indicator assembly is positioned at or on an exterior vehicle portion such as a body side panel or on an exterior rearview mirror assembly where it is readily visible from the area surrounding each of the vehicle tires, it facilitates rapid adjustment of the inflation condition of the tires, thus increasing the safe operation of the vehicle. Also, preferably, the tire inflation indicator assembly is positioned on the exterior body portion at a location readily visible to a person crouching down at a wheel tire to inflate. The present invention includes provision of audible and/or tactile tire pressure indicators, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a tire inflation monitoring system, according to the invention, provides a useful indication to the vehicle user when the user is entering or leaving the vehicle that the tire pressure monitored by each of the tire inflation indicator assemblies is within a range of pressure as recommended by the manufacturer or outside of that range, thus alerting the user to take action to bring the pressure of the tire within the range specified by the manufacturer preferably before operating the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Other modifications may suggest themselves to the skilled artisan. For example, a single tire inflation indicator assembly <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may include one color indicator for the rear tire on that side of the vehicle and a different color indicator for the front tire on that side of the vehicle. Alternatively, one tire inflation indicator assembly may be provided for indicating the tire inflation condition of the rear tire assembly, and a different tire inflation indicator assembly may indicate the direct inflation condition of the front tire on that side of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Also, communication between components of the tire inflation assistance monitoring system of this present invention can be by wire (such as a direct wire connection or via an optical fiber link) or via a bus system (such as a CAN or LIN system, as known in the arts) or wirelessly such as by IR or RF communication (such as using a local area RF broadcast network such as the BLUETOOTH protocol from Motorola of Schaumberg, Ill.), such as is disclosed in co-pending and co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/466,010, filed Dec. 17, 1999, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, and in co-pending and co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/449,121, filed Nov. 24, 1999, and entitled REARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY WITH UTILITY FUNCTIONS, by Barry W. Hutzel et al. of Donnelly Corporation, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Note also, while it is preferable to position the visible tire pressure indicator (such as a high intensity LED light source) on an exterior portion of the vehicle, it may optionally be located at an interior cabin portion (such as at a rearview mirror assembly (preferably at its mount to a header or windshield portion, or at a lower/underside portion of the mirror housing), or as part of an interior roof portion such as a headliner region or a dome light or as part of a door panel/frame/assembly (inside the vehicle but visible via a side window)). However, preferably it is mounted at an interior portion that is visible to a person crouching down to pump air into a tire on the vehicle. Use of an audible tire pressure indicator (such as a horn of the vehicle or another sound generator that momentarily sounds or &ldquo;chirps&rdquo; when the correct tire pressure is reached) in conjunction with a visible tire pressure indicator (and especially an interior cabin-mounted visible tire pressure indicator) is most preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Also, it may be advantageous to mount a controller for the passenger-side wheel tire sensors (or at least the antenna thereof) in or at the passenger-side exterior side view mirror assembly (such as in the mirror casing thereof) so that a passenger-side tire adjust event is readily recognized. Also, it may be advantageous to mount a controller for the driver-side wheel tire sensors (or at least the antenna thereof) in or at the driver-side exterior side view mirror assembly (such as in the mirror casing thereof) so that a driver-side tire adjust event is readily recognized. Also, it may be advantageous to mount a controller for the driver-side wheel tire sensors (or at least the antenna thereof) in or at the driver-side door handle assembly(s) (such as in the casing thereof) so that a driver-side tire adjust event is readily recognized. Also, it may be advantageous to mount a controller for the passenger-side wheel tire sensors (or at least the antenna thereof) in or at the passenger-side door handle assembly(s) (such as in the casing thereof) so that a passenger-side tire adjust event is readily recognized Also, any of the displays or video displays above can display tire pressure status, as described above, and further can optionally, occasionally, or frequently display other types of information, such as temperature, compass headings, messages, including pager status, pager messages, E-mail messages, images from an interior cabin surveillance system or back-up system, or the like, in addition to or alternately to the tire pressure status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Other displays are possible, such as of a night-vision camera (preferably a multi-pixel pyrodetection array) that views forward of the vehicle (or rearward) when driving/parking at night. Location at or within an exterior side view mirror assembly is a desired location. Also, preferably, either or both of the night vision camera and the video display screen it displays on is removable from the vehicle. Thus, for example, a vehicle can be equipped with a night vision camera assembly (such as available from Raytheon) and with the night vision camera assembly detachably mounted to the vehicle (such as to a door of the vehicle such that the imaging surface/lens of the camera assembly is outside the vehicle. The field of view of the night vision camera is in the direction of the vehicle&apos;s forward direction of travel. A displays screen for this camera can be provided in the interior cabin (such as at, on or adjacent to the interior rearview mirror assembly). The display screen is included in a display assembly that is also detachably mounted in the vehicle. Then, for example, when a driver drives to a dark site (such as a field or woods while out hunting) using and guided by the vehicle-mounted night vision camera/display system, the driver can optionally detach the camera from its mount on the vehicle and detach the display from its mount on the vehicle, and then remount the night vision camera and the display assembly onto a portable, battery-powered module that the driver can then use as a portable night vision system that allows the driver &ldquo;see&rdquo; in the dark by using viewing the image generated by the night vision camera on the display screen of the display device. This provides a night vision &ldquo;flashlight&rdquo; utility. Upon return to the vehicle, the driver demounts the camera and display assemblies from the portable module, remounts them on the vehicle, and recommences in-vehicle use while driving home. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Also, tire pressure monitoring systems of the type which include at each wheel, within the pressurized cavity of the tire, a pressure transducer, preferably also a temperature transducer, a microcontroller or control circuit, and a radio frequency transmitter, in many cases do not have any external source of power. A small battery must support the continuous transmission of data for many years, 10 years being typical of automotive component required lifetimes. It is, therefore, essential that the wheel based measuring and transmitting units consume as little power as possible. In order to achieve minimum power consumption, pressure and temperature conditions are measured and transmitted on a regular but relatively infrequent basis. Typically, the measurement and transmission periods may be in the order of micro or milliseconds, while the delay between these periods may be in the order of seconds or tens of seconds. While, since generally tire pressures and temperatures change relatively slowly, these frequencies of transmission are sufficient for normal communication of tire conditions. However, they are not sufficient to monitor the rapid changes associated with typical inflation rates, or deflation rates resulting from severe tire damage. It is preferable, therefore, to increase the rate of data transmission, to the order of several transmissions per second, during periods of rapid tire pressure change, to provide timely feedback to the operator during the tire inflation process during a tire pressure adjust event such as at a service station, or to provide timely warning of a relatively rapid tire deflation due to tire damage to a driver while driving the vehicle (such as via any of the in-cabin tire pressure/status displays described above. While the tire pressure monitoring system may be put into tire inflation mode by a user operated switch (or by detection of depression of a tire valve nipple or the like), it may preferably be selected automatically when the central control unit detects the increased frequency of transmissions from a particular wheel mounted unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the above described system to aid the tire inflation process may be applied to tire pressure monitoring systems which do not rely on battery powered transmissions such as wireless induction systems or systems which incorporate mechanically generated power based on wheel rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The temperature of the air within a tire cavity varies significantly over time due to varying ambient temperature, road surface temperature, and heat generation due to tire wall flexing while driving. Since the air within the tire obeys Boyle&apos;s Law, the pressure and tire volume vary with varying temperature according to the formula: P&times;V/T&equals;a constant. Typically the desired tire air pressure is specified at a nominal ambient temperature, but in a typical tire inflation situation in which the vehicle has been driven to a service station or suitable source of compressed air, the tires on the wheels on that vehicle are typically at temperatures other than (and higher than) the nominal ambient value (for example, if parked for a prolonged period so that tire temperature matched ambient temperature), depending on the recent driving history or current ambient conditions. It is undesirable to wait such as at a service station for sufficient time for the tires to cool to ambient temperatures before inflation. It is, therefore, preferable that the tire pressure monitoring system includes an algorithm based on Boyle&apos;s Law (or another gas pressure/temperature relationship), which corrects for the effect of temperature, and with the tire pressure monitoring system determining the appropriate pressure set point on the basis of the desired pressure at ambient temperature and the temperature of the air in the tire, and a pressure volume relationship for the particular tire and wheel rim combination. It is reasonable to ignore the volume variable since this will be approximately constant for a particular pressure for a particular wheel rim and tire combination. Thus a tire pressure indicator provided such as at an outside side view mirror assembly, or by use of a horn chirp or similar momentary sounding of the car horn, by flashing of the turn signal lamps, or by other means can provide a signal to the operator at a temperature compensated pressure such that on return to nominal ambient temperature the pressure will return to the desired set point. By this means the vehicle operator does not have to be concerned with absolute pressure values, or with the effects of temperature. This same algorithm may be used for continuous monitoring such that out of adjustment pressure warnings are only initiated after temperature compensations have been made. Thus, on setting up the system, it is only necessary to input the manufacturer&apos;s recommended pressure at nominal temperatures for each tire on the vehicle. If the system requires wheel position training, the appropriate action such as a slight inflation or deflation of tires in sequence can be taken. Thereafter the tire condition indication merely requires a system-active status and a low or high pressure condition (if present) input, and wheel position identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> It is known to provide a system with a receiver local to each wheel on the vehicle, for instance located in the wheel well, such that the system does not require the wheel position training step described above. For economic reasons, however, a single omni-directional receiver is more typically used. However, it is practical to combine the described tire monitoring system with two directional antennae in a central location such that one antenna is responsive to transmission sources to the left and right hand sides of the vehicle, the second responsive to transmission sources to the rear and front of the vehicle. Combination of the two antennae responses allows the economic determination, such as by a triangulation algorithm, of each wheel transmitter position without the need for local antennae, thus avoiding the need for the above described position training step, and retraining after tire rotation, and allowing an automatic identification of from what wheel type (front or rear; passenger-side or driver-side) an individual wireless broadcast of tire pressure data received at a central controller is being broadcast from. Such an autosensing tire pressure system (that automatically identifies the particular wheel on the vehicle from which a received wireless signal is being broadcast from so that it can distinguish that, for example, a tire sensor broadcasting is located on a rear driver&apos;s side wheel rather than any other wheel) has many advantages. Preferably, such an autosensing tire pressure system includes two spaced antennae (either spaced apart on a common assembly in the vehicle or at different locations in the vehicle, such as one antenna on a driver side, such as at a driver side exterior rearview mirror assembly, with the other on a passenger side, such as at a passenger side exterior rearview mirror assembly or with one located at an interior rearview mirror assembly and the other in a header console or other roof portion of the vehicle). By the receiving antennae of the tire pressure display/monitoring system being spaced apart but in known locations within or at the vehicle, a control or processor, such as within the tire pressure monitoring controller, can identify the location of a given tire sensor in a given wheel by analyzing the differences in the respective signals using, for example, triangulation techniques, which triangulation techniques are known in the art. Thus, the driver can rotate or change the position of tires on the vehicle and the tire monitoring system will &ldquo;learn&rdquo; or automatically identify the location of each tire sensor broadcasting, and will then be able to inform the driver, for example, that &ldquo;Tire pressure for Front Passenger-Side Tire is 32 psi&rdquo;. Thus, an automatic vehicle wheel identification function is provided for the tire pressure display/monitoring system of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method of assisting manual tire inflation by a person whereby, for example, a driver can pull up to an air compressor station at a service station, turn off the vehicle engine and exit the vehicle, and crouch down at a particular wheel tire to inflate using the air hose provided at the service center. Upon connecting the air hose to the valve stem of that tire, the driver can view a visible indicator provided at an exterior vehicle portion such as on the underside of the casing that houses the exterior mirror reflector in the exterior side view mirror assembly on that side of the vehicle, and/or hear an audible tire pressure indicator such as can be provided via a sound pattern produced by the horn on the vehicle that is coded to/indicative of the tire pressure condition being sensed in a particular tire that is having its tire pressure adjusted, and/or experience actuation of a tactile tire pressure indicator while pumping air into a tire. Upon commencing the tire pressure adjust event, the driver can view the indicator, whose illumination is coded to indicate the tire pressure status (whether it be in an under pressure condition, a correct pressure condition or an over pressure condition) and/or listen for/to the sound generated by the audible tire pressure indicator, and/or experience actuation of a tactile tire pressure indicator while pumping air into a tire. Guided by the coded illumination of the indicator(s) and/or audible sounds provided external the vehicle and/or tactile feedback from the tactile tire pressure sensor, and while still crouched in the act of adjusting tire pressure, the driver can inflate/deflate that tire&apos;s pressure to the recommended, desired pressure level (a pressure level preferably stored in a memory of the vehicle). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Other changes and modifications in the specifically described embodiments can be carried out without departing from the principles of the invention which is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims, as interpreted according to the principles of patent law including the doctrine of equivalents. </paragraph>
