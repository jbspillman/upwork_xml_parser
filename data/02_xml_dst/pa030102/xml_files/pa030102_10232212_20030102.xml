<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to modular display systems and workstations and, more particularly, to modular display systems and workstations featuring a gravity feed dispenser. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Gravity feed dispensers are known in the art. Such dispensers may be used to store and dispense a wide variety of items, such as empty containers, bottles or vials, and find use in a wide variety of environments. In general, such dispensers comprise one or more side-by-side elongate, generally vertical chutes, each having an opening at its top end for loading and a dispensing receptacle that opens at the bottom end of the chute. Items to be stored in the dispenser are loaded into the chute through the top opening and are thereby stacked within the chute, with the bottommost item or items being available for removal from the dispensing receptacle on a first-in-first-out basis. When an item is removed from the dispenser via the dispensing receptacle, the items stored above the removed item will move downward under the force of gravity and refill the dispensing receptacle. In this manner, so long as there is a supply of items within the dispenser, the dispensing receptacle is automatically refilled whenever an item is removed. Examples of prior art gravity feed dispensers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,692,053 (Calhoun et al.), 3,194,433 (Heselov), 4,479,583 (Franklin et al.), and 5,361,937 (Weise). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Gravity feed dispensers are utilized in a variety of different ways. For example, retailers often use gravity feed dispensers to display merchandise, such as cigarette packages, batteries, candy, or clothespins. (See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,194,433 and 5,361,937.) Gravity feed dispensers are also used to store items in a manner that provides convenient access to such items. For example, pharmacists are constantly filling vials with pills and the like when filling prescriptions. Therefore, pharmacists require a steady supply of empty prescription vials of different sizes. To meet this need, pharmacies often store a variety of empty vials (and the caps therefor) in drawers, on shelves and in gravity feed dispensers, giving pharmacists ready access to a supply of vials and caps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, gravity feed dispensers were generally fixed directly to a wall or the front face of a display rack. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,479,583 and 5,361,937 show gravity feed dispensers which are mounted to a wall for purposes of displaying a variety of items for sale. While such dispensers may present an attractive and easy-to-use sales display, mounting a dispenser in this fashion takes up a considerable amount of valuable space and makes it difficult to mount fixtures such as shelves, racks, hanger rods, storage bins, drawers, hooks and the like in front of the dispenser. Because access to the gravity feed dispenser is typically only required at the top loading opening and bottom dispensing receptacle (so that items can be loaded and removed from the dispenser), the space taken up by the height of the dispenser between the bottom and top can be considered dead or wasted space in the prior art applications. Thus, in situations where space is at a premium, there is a need for a system for mounting a gravity feed dispenser that allows a variety of fixtures to be mounted in front of the dispenser, yet still allows easy access to the dispenser&apos;s top loading opening and bottom dispensing receptacle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, the present invention solves the foregoing shortcomings of conventionally mounted gravity feed dispensers by providing a system for mounting a gravity feed dispenser that allows one or more fixtures to be mounted in front of, and in working relationship with, the dispenser. The invention can therefore be used to create a display or storage device that maximizes space utilization by mounting shelving, hangers, rods, or other storage and display fixtures in front of the dispenser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Likewise, the invention can also be used to create a workstation featuring one or more gravity feed dispensers by mounting a work area and shelves in front of and in working relationship with the dispensers. Such a workstation is particularly suitable for use in a pharmacy where empty vials (and lids) used for filling prescriptions can be stored in dispensers integrated directly into the pharmacist&apos;s workstation, thereby eliminating the need for the pharmacist to leave the workstation to retrieve the necessary empty vials and lids. Such a workstation provides a pharmacist with additional storage and work surfaces in spaces that would otherwise be wasted.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first embodiment of the present invention comprises a support structure <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to which one or more gravity feed dispensers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are mounted. As is well known in the art, support structure <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be designed and configured so that a variety of different fixtures&mdash;such as shelves, racks, hanger rods, storage bins, drawers, hooks and the like&mdash;can be mounted on the support structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, support structure <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of vertical standards or posts <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> mounted to a base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Vertical posts <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are aligned on base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the front surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of each vertical post <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> lies in the same front plane. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, each vertical post <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has a front surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> featuring a series of vertical slots <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As described in more detail below, slots <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are sized and shaped to receive mounting brackets, thereby allowing a variety of different fixtures to be mounted to the vertical posts <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the support structure is approximately 84 inches in height, and the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is about 40 inches long, 24 inches deep and 6 inches in height. Preferably, the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a modular unit so that it can be combined with other like bases to create a row or aisle of display or shelving units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Support structures of the type illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (excluding gravity feed dispensers) are well known in the art and need not be described in detail here. Such support structures are commercially available from a number of different sources, including Dann Dee Display Fixtures of Niles, Ill., and Syndicate Systems of Middlebury, Ind. Examples of support structures like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,991,889, 4,046,083, 4,919,282, 5,605,238 and 5,697,507, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,991,889 shows a support structure comprising a base with slotted vertical posts for mounting shelving and other fixtures in a variety of configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the support structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is shown for illustrative purposes only, and is not meant to limit the scope of the present invention. Any type of suitable support structure can be used in the present invention. Likewise, as shown in the prior art patents mentioned above, there are a large variety of gravity feed dispensers known in the art for applications quite different than disclosed here&mdash;gravity feed dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is for illustrative purposes only, and is not meant to limit the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As best seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, illustrative gravity feed dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises one or more side-by-side storage means such as elongate chutes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, each chute <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> having a top loading end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a bottom dispensing receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and a front face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extending between the loading end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the dispensing receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the elongate chutes are preferably provided in varying widths so that the dispenser can accommodate a variety of different sized items, such as a variety of different sized and shaped vials and lids (not shown). While the dimensions of the gravity feed dispenser can vary greatly and without restriction depending on the particular application, in a preferred embodiment the dispenser is about 42 inches in height, 14 &frac12; inches in width, and 11 inches deep. In a preferred embodiment, the individual chutes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are about 6 &frac12; inches deep and range in width from about 2 inches to almost 4 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the top loading end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of each chute <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> features a loading opening <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> through which items can be loaded into the chute <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Likewise, each bottom dispensing receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> features a dispensing opening <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> through which one or more items stored within the dispenser can be removed. In the preferred embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, dispensing receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> projects outwardly from chute <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to provide easy access to items stored therein, but this receptacle configuration is not required and a variety of other configurations may be used to fit the needs of different environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The gravity feed dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably made from a clear plastic (so that the contents of the dispenser can be viewed from the outside), but any suitable material can be used. In addition, although the preferred dispenser shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is of solid construction (i.e., is made up of a series of solid walls), the dispenser can also be of an open design. For example, an alternate gravity feed dispenser <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and described below comprises a chute defined by wire rods <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, rather than solid walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Returning to the preferred embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, gravity feed dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprises mounting brackets <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for mounting the dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to support structure <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As best seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, mounting bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises a generally L-shaped member formed by a side wall <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and a front wall <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the length of the bracket is about 4 inches and the height is about three inches. One or more hooked tongues <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> extend rearwardly from the front wall <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> parallel to, and in the same direction as, the side wall <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Hooked tongues <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are sized and shaped to fit within and removably engage vertical slots <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or other appropriate apertures provided on vertical post <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, two mounting brackets <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are attached on each side of the dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, one pair near the top and the other pair near the bottom. For illustrative purposes, the side wall <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is shown attached to the side of the dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by screws <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. However, any suitable means can be used to attach mounting brackets <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As best shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, mounting bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is sized and shaped to fit around a corner <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the post <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> when the bracket tongues <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> are inserted into the slots <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the front surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of vertical post <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The corner <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of vertical post <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> fits within the inner corner x (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) formed by side wall <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and front wall <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Thus, when mounting bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> engages the vertical post <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the inner surface <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the front wall <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the bracket is juxtaposed against the front surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the post, and side wall <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> extends along the side wall of the post. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The mounting brackets <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> should be secured to the dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that when the dispenser is mounted to the vertical posts <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, shelving or other fixtures can be secured to the posts in front of the dispenser. Preferably, each mounting bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is positioned on the gravity feed dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the inner surface <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the bracket front wall <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is aligned with the front face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the dispenser (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>). Accordingly, when the dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted to the support structure <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> via mounting brackets <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the front face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the dispenser is flush with, and does not extend forward of, the front surfaces <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of vertical posts <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> This positioning of the gravity feed dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on support structure <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> makes it easy to mount one or more additional fixtures&mdash;such as shelves, racks, hanger rods, storage bins, drawers, hooks and the like&mdash;in front of or in working relationship with the dispenser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> number of fixtures&mdash;including shelves <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and slat wall section <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>&mdash;are mounted in front of the gravity feed dispensers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These fixtures can be mounted to the support structure <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by any suitable means known in the art, such as, for example, the conventional mounting brackets <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, which brackets are sized and shaped to engage the elongate slots <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of vertical posts <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</cross-reference>, conventional brackets <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> can also be used to mount a work surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a drawer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in working relation with, such as below or level with, the dispensing receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the gravity feed dispensers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This configuration creates a workstation in which the dispensers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are fully accessible, yet out of the way. And, because the dispensers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are located out of the way, the workstation can further include numerous configurations of shelves, drawers, hooks and other fixtures attached to the vertical posts. The invention can thus be configured to form a wide variety of display units and workstations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> For example, the workstation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is particularly well suited for use in a pharmacy as a workstation for filling prescriptions. Empty vials of various sizes (and their lids) used to hold medicine (not shown) can easily be loaded into the dispensers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the loading openings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at the rear of the work-station. Once the vials and lids are loaded into the dispensers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, they are easily accessed via the dispensing receptacles <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> by a pharmacist working at surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Shelves <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and drawer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> provide valuable storage space for medicines, supplies and documents which may be necessary for filling prescriptions. Slat wall <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> provides additional space to support a wide variety of accessories and fixtures, such as, for example, paper and folder trays, pen and pencil holders, telephone holders, and receptacles for other office or pharmacy supplies and equipment. By providing a central and easily accessible location for all the supplies that a pharmacist would need to fill prescriptions, the invention provides an efficient and time-saving pharmacy workstation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Similarly, various fixtures can be mounted on the support structure <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and arranged in any number of configurations in relation to the dispensers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to create a wide variety of free-standing modular workstations to meet the needs of different applications. In addition to work surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the workstation may include some or all of the fixtures described above, including shelves <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, drawer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, slat wall <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and dispensers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Mounting work surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a free-standing modular support structure, like structure <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, provides a work-station that can be used in spaces and locations where it was not convenient to use prior art structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> While the present invention is described above in connection with specific embodiments, the invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications or equivalents that may be included within its sphere and scope, as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
