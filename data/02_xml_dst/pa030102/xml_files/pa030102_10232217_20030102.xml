<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The technical field relates generally to semiconductor integrated circuits. More particularly, it pertains to capacitors in semiconductor integrated circuits. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A capacitor is composed of two layers of a material that is electrically conductive (hereinafter, electrode) brought near to one another and separated by a material that is electrically nonconductive. Suppose the capacitor is connected to a battery with a certain voltage level (hereinafter, energy level). Charges will flow from the battery to be stored in the capacitor until the capacitor exhibits the energy level of the battery. Then, suppose further that the capacitor is disconnected from the battery. The capacitor will indefinitely exhibit the energy level of the battery until the charges stored in the capacitor are removed either by design or by accident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This ability of the capacitor to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; an energy level is valuable to the operation of semiconductor integrated circuits. Often, the operation of such circuits may require that data be stored and retrieved as desired. Because of its ability to remember, the capacitor is a major component of a semiconductor memory cell. One memory cell may store one bit of data. A system of memory cells is a semiconductor memory array where information can be randomly stored or retrieved from each memory cell. Such a system is also known as a random-access memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One type of random-access memory is dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The charges stored in DRAM tend to leak away over a short time. It is thus necessary to periodically refresh the charges stored in the DRAM by the use of additional circuitry. Even with the refresh burden, DRAM is a popular type of memory because it can occupy a very small space on a semiconductor surface. This is desirable because of the need to maximize storage capacity on the limited surface area of an integrated circuit </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One type of capacitor that supports an increase in storage capacity uses an electrically nonconductive material that has a high dielectric constant. The processing of such a capacitor occurs in an environment that may not be completely contaminant-proof. Such contaminants may act to degrade the electrically nonconductive material. That act compromises the ability of the capacitor to maintain the charges. This is detrimental to the storage ability of a capacitor and would render a memory cell defective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, what is needed are systems, devices, structures, and methods to inhibit the described effect so as to enhance capacitors with a high dielectric constant in the presence of contaminants. </paragraph>

The variables x and y are indicative of a desired number of atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another illustrative embodiment includes a method of enhancing a semiconductor structure so as to inhibit dielectric degradation. The method includes forming at least one inhibiting layer to define a chamber having an aperture and at least two sidewalls that extend outwardly from the aperture. The inhibiting layer includes a nitride compound.

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor structure according to one embodiment of the present invention. The semiconductor structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may illustrate an example of a single DRAM cell. The semiconductor structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, field isolators <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, transistor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, insulation layers <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, another semiconductor structure such as a capacitor <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, and a metallization layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the metallization layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be considered a conductive plug. In another embodiment, the conductive plug includes polysilicon. The transistor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> includes source/drain regions <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, silicide region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, spacers <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, gate oxide <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and gate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The source/drain regions <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>include lightly doped source/drain regions <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The capacitor <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> includes an electrode <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a dielectric layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, another electrode <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and at least one inhibiting layer that comprises <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The dielectric layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is coupled to the electrodes <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. In various embodiments, the dielectric <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> includes (Ba,Sr)TiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, SrTiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, BaTiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Pb(Zr,Ti)O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, (Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, SrBi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, SrBi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Nb<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, SrBi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(NbTa)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, doped Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, Ti-doped Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, ZrO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, HfO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SiO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Charges can be transferred into or removed from the capacitor <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> by turning on the transistor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The transistor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is turned on by an appropriate voltage level and polarity placed at the gate <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> so that a depletion region and conducting channel are formed between the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. If charges are to be transferred into the capacitor <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, these charges are introduced at the source/drain region <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>by a buried bit line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, so that they may travel across the conducting channel into the source/drain region <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>,, conduct through the metallization layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and enter the electrode <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The charges cannot go any further because the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is electrically nonconductive. However, these charges will attract opposite polarity charges to appear at electrode <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Hence, an electric field is set up between the electrodes <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Energy is stored in this electric field. This electric field is the phenomenon that allows the capacitor to &ldquo;remember.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> There exists an industry-wide drive to smaller memory cells to increase storage density on the limited surface area of an integrated circuit. This has motivated the use of a thin film nonconductive material for use as a dielectric <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of the capacitor <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Contaminants may be present in the processing of the semiconductor structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Such contaminants include moisture and diatomic substances, such as hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Moisture may come from the de-ionized water that is used to rinse and clean the semiconductor structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Diatomic substances exists in a gaseous form during an annealing process. In one embodiment, such a gaseous form occurs at about <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> degrees Celsius. Without at least one of the inhibiting layers <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, the contaminants may undesirably act with a portion of the semiconductor structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, such as the dielectric <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of the capacitor <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Such act may degrade the properties of the dielectric <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to cause the capacitor <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to become defective over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> At least four types of dielectric property are affected by the presence of contaminants. First, dielectric loss may undesirably have a dependent relationship with the operating frequency of the system in the presence of contaminants. Such a dependent relationship may be caused by the dispersion of the permittivity. Thus, as the frequency of the system is increased, the dielectric loss is increased thereby causing the capacitor <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to become defective. This degradation is especially pernicious since there is a need to move data at a speed in the gigahertz range. At this speed, with this degradation, the capacitor loses its valuable ability to remember. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A second type of dielectric property that is degraded in the presence of contaminants includes a decrease in the permittivity. A capacitor with a small permittivity does not store as many charges. This degradation defeats the ability of reducing the sizes of capacitor while increasing the ability of the capacitor to store more charges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Third, contaminants may cause the dielectric to leak stored charges and thereby cause a loss of stored data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> And fourth, a decrease in dielectric lifetime is seen in the presence of contaminants. Contaminants have a significant impact on the dielectric lifetime compared to other properties of the dielectric. In many instances, the lifetime of the dielectric is decreased by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the lifetime of the dielectric may be decreased while no apparent degradation can be observed with other properties of the dielectric.

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A formation of a hydroxide compound due to moisture may be a cause of the degradation. Another cause of the degradation due to hydrogen may be attributed by a formation of shallow donor levels in the dielectric material, or from changes in the stoichiometry of the dielectric and in the dielectric&apos;s surrounding films (such as the electrodes). For films containing oxygen, change in stoichiometry generally occurs by reduction of oxygen content in those films by hydrogen. </paragraph>
