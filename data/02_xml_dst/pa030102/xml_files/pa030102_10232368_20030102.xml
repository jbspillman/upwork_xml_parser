<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an apparatus for sampling and analysis of thermally-labile species, such as mercury, arsenic, selenium, sulfur, lead, carbon, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, n-alkanes and the like, as may be associated with a variety of solid matrices (e.g., airborne particulate matter, suspended particles, soil materials, colloids). The invention also relates to a method of carrying out such sampling and analysis. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various technologies exist for either collecting or separating particulate material from a fluid flow such as a gaseous stream. Such devices include filter packs which collect the material(s) of interest and the filter(s) then being treated as, for example, by using one or more acids or oxidation reagents, with the resulting final solution then being analyzed. In another example, a quartz wool stationary phase is used to retain particulate material on a manually-loaded plug contained in a quartz tube. The tube, along with the collected sample, are heated to an elevated temperature and the released elements of interest are detected and quantified. Yet another example is a miniaturized device using a quartz fiber filter disc. Particulate material, suspended in one or more gases or liquids, is trapped on the filter disc, following which the device is heated and the released elements detected and quantified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When using filter packs, &ldquo;clean hands&rdquo; techniques and a clean-room facility are necessary for accurate results. Furthermore, ultra pure reagents, which are expensive, are required in those procedures involving sample treatment prior to analysis. This mode of operation is, therefore, time consuming and costly. Quartz wool plugs are difficult, if not impossible, to prepare uniformly. Hence, collection efficiency may vary from plug to plug. More importantly, sorption of gaseous species, for example elemental mercury vapor by the quartz wool, may generate erroneously high results in the determination of &ldquo;particulate-phase mercury&rdquo; in air. Miniaturized devices with a quartz fiber disc overcome the disadvantages of quartz wool plugs, but the filter disc becomes brittle after being heated at a high temperature, for example over 900&deg; C. A fresh filter disc is therefore required for each sample. Hence it is difficult to automate the whole measurement procedure, including sampling and sample analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With prior art technologies, e.g. quartz wool plugs, it is a major problem to collect particles of sub-micron size in such a way that uniform and consistent sampling is obtained. It is a further problem to provide an efficient automated and economical procedure. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a novel apparatus, and a method, which is efficient, economical and which can be easily automated. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a device for trapping particulate material in a fluid (usually/generally gaseous) stream, such as ambient air, or other fluid media, together with a pyrolyzer for sample pre-treatment prior to analysis. Thus, the present invention is suitable for sampling and analyzing mercury, for example, as well as other thermally-labile species. Broadly, a device of the present invention comprises a quartz housing with a filter member having a quartz bead plug and bead retainers such as quartz frits positioned on either side of the quartz beads. The housing, preferably in the form of a tube, is variable in length and in width. The porosity of the bead plugs may vary, as desired, depending on the size range of the particulate matter to be collected. The dimensions of the plug can vary as can the pore size of the quartz frits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the method in accordance with the inventions, a filter member comprising a quartz bead plug having quartz frits on either side thereof is loaded into a quartz housing e.g. a tube. A flow of fluid gas, for example air containing airborne particulate material, is passed through the tube with particulate material being collected in the quartz bead plug. After passage of the fluid, the whole unit may be positioned in a heating chamber where the tube and filter member are heated to a high temperature, for example up to 900&deg; C. or up to 1200&deg; C., for thermal desorption and subsequent analysis of the collected material by an analyzer located downstream of the sampling unit.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an apparatus comprises a quartz tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, having an inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an outlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Centrally positioned in the tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a filter member or element designated generally as <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, having a central plug <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of quartz beads with a layer quartz frit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on each side. Thus, fluid flow enters at inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as indicated, exiting at <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. During passage through the member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, particulate material in the gas (or liquid) is retained on the quartz beads. After a predetermined volume of fluid flows through the filter member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the flow is cut off. The tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and contained member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is then heated to, to a selected temperature for example, 1200&deg; C. The chemical species of interest, which are associated with the particulate material on the beads, are thermally desorbed (either slowly or rapidly depending upon the rate of heating of the apparatus). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is normally connected to an analyzer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the tube itself can be positioned in a heating enclosure, for example, a suitable housing as indicated at <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, for the heating thereof. To this end, any suitable heating device may be employed; preferably, the means of heating is a heater which surrounds the quartz housing or tube and may be in the form of heating wires, an infrared heating device, or a suitable microwave oven or cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The diameter and length of the tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will vary depending upon the specific application. The larger the tube, the higher the flow rate, but too large a tube can result in insufficient heating, particularly at the center of the filter member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as well as reducing the rate at which the tube is heated. In one example, the tube has a bore of between 10 and 20 mm., with the filter member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a length of about 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the size of the quartz beads can vary depending upon the specific application. As a general rule, the smaller the particle size of the particulate matter to be collected, the smaller the size of the beads. The length of the quartz bead plug <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> should be long enough to retain all particulate material in the desired size range. Typically, the particulate filtration medium <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be in the form of quartz or ceramic beads which have a size of from about 8 to about 170 mesh, and more desirably from about 40 mesh to about 120; or between 80 and 170 mesh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Also, the porosity of the quartz frits can vary depending upon the specific application. As a general rule, the pore size of the quartz frits <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> should be smaller than the size of the quartz beads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Typically, the porosity of the quartz frits will vary from a porosity value in the range of 00 to 4. Suitable quartz frits are commercially available from Heraeus Amersil Inc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, where the quartz frits are in a quartz housing, the quartz frits may be sintered to the quartz housing. The frits are fused to the interior bore of the housing, with a space there between within which quartz or ceramic beads are packed. The bead plug is thus effectively integrated with the quartz housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The method of operation according to the present invention is generally as follows (with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). A fluid, for example, air containing suspended particulate matter is drawn (with a suitable pump or other flow creating device) through the tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with the particulate matter being retained on the quartz of beads. After a predetermined volume of air, or other fluid medium, has been sampled, the flow is shut off. The tube and filter member now containing the sample, is connected to an analyzer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and is then heated to thermally desorb the material collected on the quartz or ceramic filter media. The species released are then passed through the analyzer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for the purpose of qualitative and/or quantitative chemical analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a system for collecting particulate matter suspended in a fluid medium. Ambient air, as an example, is drawn through the filter device, the flow being produced by a pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and passed through a flow meter/controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to measure/regulate the flow rate of the fluid medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> After collection, the filter device is connected (in reverse) to an analytical system, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The filter device, including the collected sample, has a carrier gas supply, for example from a cylinder <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> through a detection device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Any suitable detector may be employed for quantifying and/or identifying the species to be analyzed. For example, a detector for mercury can be a commercially available cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometer (CVAFS). A heater <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> surrounds the filter device. The heater is controlled by a variable transformer (Variac) <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A suitable carrier gas for mercury is, for example, argon, and a suitable detector would be a conventional CVAFS tuned to 253.7 nm in the case of mercury. On heating, the sample on the filter device will be thermally released and detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In a manual approach for the determination of particulate-phase mercury in ambient air, airborne particulate matter is collected on the precleaned quartz medium at a flow rate ranging from 3 to 5 L/min. After twelve hours of sampling, the device, along with the sample, is connected to an analytical train, similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The device is then heated to 900&deg; C. for 5 minutes and the released mercury species are carried downstream by argon gas at a flow rate of 200 ml per min. to a TEKRAN&reg; mercury vapor analyzer, where the mercury (and/or other constituents) in the sample is/are quantified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The systems of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> can be combined, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Air is drawn through the filter device and the flow meters of <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> via a pump <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Particulate matter is collected or retained on the filter member. After collection of a sample, the valve <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is actuated to close off direct connection to the flow meter, and thus permit flow through the detector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and flow restrictor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Carrier gas is supplied from a gas cylinder or other source, at inlet <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The filter device is heated by heater <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the released species are detected/determined by the detector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Such a system as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> can be operated manually or automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The apparatus described herein can be used for sampling and analysis of not only particulate-phase mercury but also any thermally-labile particulate species (chemical substance/element or compound) that can be thermally desorbed at, or below, a temperature of 1200&deg; C. Typical of such species are those identified above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> For example, a suitable commercial mercury analyzer can be used for fully automated monitoring of mercury associated with airborne particulate matter. Likewise, any suitable commercial carbon (or multi-element) analyzer can be used for determination of the total carbon (as well as other elemental or molecular species) associated with airborne particulate matter. Similarly, any commercial detector with proper interfacing can be used for determination of thermally-labile species associated with particulate matter in ambient air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The invention provides for both sampling and analysis of thermally-labile species associated with airborne particulate matter (i.e., the sample) without direct handling, transfer and preparation of the sample. The actual filtering device, that is the tube with the filter member supported by quarts frits, is entirely reusable. This makes possible the automated monitoring of mercury and other thermally-labile species associated with airborne particulate matter, for example, by connecting the apparatus of the present invention as a front-end device on a TEKRAN&reg; automated mercury analyzer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The use of quartz or ceramic beads and frits of this invention, instead of conventional filter packs and quartz wool plugs according to the prior art, thus provides numerous distinct and significant advantages including the fact that the device is entirely reusable, easily cleaned, and sampling and analysis procedures are less time-consuming as well as being less costly. Automation (of sampling and/or analysis) is also possible and the sample collection apparatus is chemically inert and can withstand high temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The sampling apparatus of this invention has an all quartz construction and no corrosive parts or components, thus making it chemically inert. It is, therefore, resistant to organic or inorganic acids and many other normally reactive chemicals. It is thus also suitable for filtration of corrosive gases and liquids containing suspended solids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The apparatus of the present invention is quickly assembled and easily decontaminated by thermal means and other types of treatment, thus avoiding the use of toxic or environmentally unfriendly cleaning agents/reagents/hazardous solutions or the like. Thus, the method and apparatus of the present invention can achieve ultra-trace analytical detection limits and extremely low (sub-ppt) operational analytical blanks. Furthermore, the sampling device is suitable for high temperature applications and the quartz tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is of a transparent nature, allowing easy visual inspection and direct observation of the sample at all stages. The beads (uniform in diameter) give a precise pore size distribution and function as a good heat diffuser by having a large surface area conducive to heat distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the generally known existing techniques (a) filter packs, (b) quartz wool plugs and (c) fiber discs or mats. Filter packs generally contain one or more membrane filter(s) of 47 mm diameter or larger, which are precleaned using acid solutions, or heating, depending upon the filter medium. The filters are then manually loaded into the filter holder. After sampling, the sample collected on the filter medium (e.g. cellulose (filter paper), polyethylene, &ldquo;Teflon&rdquo;, glass fiber or quartz fiber) is transferred, along with the filter, into either a container where it is extracted or digested using acids or mixtures of activation reagents (with or without ultrasonication) followed by analysis, or alternatively a chamber for thermal desorption, followed by identification and quantification. For accurate results, when using a conventional or traditional trace or ultra-trace measurement procedure, a &ldquo;clean hands&rdquo; technique and a clean-room facility are essential. Ultra-pure reagents, a necessity for traditional approaches are costly. The conventional procedure is time consuming and expensive to operate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For quartz wool plugs, the particulate matter is retained (at an unknown collection efficiency) by the quartz wool plug and then the apparatus is heated to a high temperature, the released elements detected and quantified. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to prepare wool plugs uniformly and thus collection efficiency can vary from plug to plug. Absorption of gaseous forms of the element(s) of interest (e.g. Hg&deg; vapor in the case of determining particulate&mdash;phase mercury) by the quartz wool during the sample collection step can generate erroneously high results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Other devices, such as those employing a quartz fiber disc, trap particulate material on the disc. The disc, with collected sample, is heated to a high temperature and released elements detected and quantified. Although overcoming the disadvantages of quartz wool plugs, the quartz fiber filter disc will become brittle after heating and therefore a fresh disc is required for each sample, making it difficult to automate the whole procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus the invention provides for a reusable member, having a consistent bead size for consistent trapping. It is not detrimentally affected by heat or by other extraction/desorption steps, for example, such as corrosive acids or other hazardous reagents. The bead size can be optimized for any particulate material to be collected. The easy and effective cleaning feature and reusability provide for an economical system capable of complete automation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention, when using quartz beads, provides the flexibility to adjust bead size to suit the particulate matter to be collected, thus ensuring high efficiency of retention during the sampling step. </paragraph>
