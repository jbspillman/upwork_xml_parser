<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a dynamic RAM used in semiconductor memory systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, the width of circuits in semiconductor devices has decreased. This reduction in circuit width has increased the capacity of semiconductor memory. As memory capacity increases, the memory is referred to as large scaled. As memory size increases, memory efficiency is a desired quality. Logic-hybrid memory includes a logic block that functions beyond merely controlling reading and writing to specific memory cells. Logic blocks also control a signal called an I/F signal that performs an interface (I/F) between the logic block and the memory block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An example of this type of semiconductor where the semiconductor chip includes a logic circuit and a memory is described in &ldquo;A 500-Megabyte/n Data-Rate 4.5 M DRAM&rdquo; Kushiyama et al., <highlight><italic>IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits Vol. </italic></highlight>28, No. 4, April 1993. This article illustrates in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 10</cross-reference> and describes a memory block (DRAM CORE) and a logic block (INTERFACE LOGIC) in a chip. Signals, such as /RAS, /CAS, and an address signal are control signals from the exterior of the chip, or in a conventional memory chip are the interface (I/F) signals sent between the logic block and the memory block. The I/F signals are basic signals for control of the logic block and operations of the memory block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Usually, the logic block controls the I/F signal so that the memory block can operate normally. However, problems occur when the logic block does not operate normally. This may be due to abnormal signals generated by the logic block operating in an unstable state. Often these unstable states occur immediately after power is turned on. Other events causing abnormal signals are temporary, unexpected wave forms from the logic block due to various external factors, such as a changing power source or a change in temperature during a bum-in examination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When memory block receives the an abnormal signal, dangerous, large currents can be generated damaging the internal circuit of the memory block. This event may cause latch up and can fatally damage the semiconductor package or circuit board. If the memory block is not initialized correctly, the reading and writing operations normally performed when the power source is turned on cannot be performed. The problem of conventional logic-hybrid memory is the logic block and the memory block are connected to each other only through the I/F signal. No mechanism protects the memory block against abnormal signals generated by the logic block. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This invention provides semiconductor protection for memory that is susceptible to abnormal and damaging signals from the logic block. An objection of the invention is the interruption of abnormal signals from the logic block. This is accomplished by the semiconductor memory having a first control signal line controlling a selection from row addresses, a second control signal line controlling a selection from column addresses, a first voltage control system cutting off the first control signal line in case a predetermined number of control signals are abnormal, and a second voltage control system cutting off the second control signal line in case a predetermined number of control signals are abnormal, preventing these abnormal signals from reaching the memory cell array. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> This invention is described with four embodiments. FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> though <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrate the first embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) illustrate a schematic view of the logic-hybrid memory and a circuit structure of the memory and control blocks. The first voltage control circuit is arranged in an interface block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in the logic-hybrid memory <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) illustrates the circuit&apos;s overall operational aspects in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The memory cell array has row addresses and column addresses used by the row decoder and column decoder, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The first voltage control circuit is partially illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The first voltage control circuit comprises NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and PMOS transistors <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are transfer gates. The gate electrode of the PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to a reset signal line of inner circuit INRST, and the gate electrode of the NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to signal line BINRST (reversal signal of INRST). The input of this transfer gate is connected to signal line RASBx, and the output is connected to RASBi. RASB is the reverse signal of the Row Address Strobe signal. RASBx is the external signal line of RASB, and RASBi is the internal signal line of RASB. Therefore, RASBi is connected to the word line and memory cell array through a row decoder illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). RASBx is connected to the circuit in the logic block in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). A source of the PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the high voltage power source VDD and a drain is connected to RASBi. A gate is connected to signal line BINRST. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The second voltage control circuit is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The circuit diagram for the second voltage control circuit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is similar to the circuit diagram for the first voltage control circuit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The difference between the two circuits is the circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is coupled between CASBi and CASBx instead of RASBx and RASBi. CASB is the reversal signal of the Column Address Strobe Signal. CASBx is the external signal line of CASB and CASBi is the internal signal line of CASB. Therefore, CASBI is connected to the bit line through the column decoder in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). CASBx is connected to the circuit in the logic block in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates another view of the first voltage control circuit and the second voltage control circuit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the circuit has NAND gates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and an inverter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. RASBx, CASBx, and BPRST are connected to the input leads of NAND gate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. BPRST is generated from the power on signal generator and keeps the circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in reset state by the time the memory in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) turns on. When BPRST is &ldquo;L,&rdquo; the circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is in a reset state. When BPRST is &ldquo;H&rdquo; the circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is in the activated state. The output of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and the power on signal generator are connected to the input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The outputs of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are coupled to the input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is connected to the output power on signal generator and the NAND gate <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The output of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is connected to the signal line INRST and the input of the inverter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The output of the inverter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is connected to the signal line BINRST illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The circuits in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference> illustrate the first voltage control systems while the circuits in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> illustrate the second voltage control systems. Operation of the first and second voltage control systems is illustrated in the timing chart depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the signal generator for the power on generates a predetermines voltage during the time period between a predetermined time and the time when the power is turned on. The control signal BPRST, generated from the power on signal generator, is &ldquo;L&rdquo; from the time the power source turns on until time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. After time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the BPRST is &ldquo;H,&rdquo; as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> (1) The case when the control signal BPRST is &ldquo;L&rdquo;(to time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The operation of the circuit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is split into two parts, when the control signal BPRST is &ldquo;L&rdquo; and when it is &ldquo;H.&rdquo; Since one input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is set to &ldquo;L,&rdquo; node <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> serves as the &ldquo;H.&rdquo; The control signal INRST serves as a &ldquo;H&rdquo; and the control signal BINRST serves as &ldquo;L.&rdquo; The transfer gate shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> is set to the off position. Consequently, RASBi is disconnected to RASBx and CASBi is disconnected to CASBx. Therefore, RASBx is disconnected to the memory block in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the memory block is unable to perform normal operations (e.g., reading and writing modes). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> (2) The case when the BPRST is &ldquo;H&rdquo;(After time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One of the input leads of NAND gate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is set to &ldquo;H.&rdquo; When RASBx and CASBi are &ldquo;H,&rdquo; node <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> serves an &ldquo;H.&rdquo; Accordingly, node <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> serves as &ldquo;L,&rdquo; and the transfer gate in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> are set to the on position. Consequently, RASBi is connected to RASBx and CASBi is connected to CASBx. Therefore, the memory block carries out normal operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Usually, at the time power is turned on an electronic circuit experiences a high possibility that noise is added to the input signal. If noise does occur and reaches the memory block through a control signal line such as CASBx, and RASBx, latch-up can occur. However, using the circuits described in this invention, from the time the power source turns on, to the predetermined time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the control signal BPRST is &ldquo;L.&rdquo; The transfer gate is turned off as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. Therefore, this invention prevents abnormal signals generated at the time the power source turns on, from reaching the memory block. Therefore, an abnormal signal never reaches the sensitive memory block. An internal circuit in the memory block would be destroyed if an abnormal signal, such as when the power source turns on, reaches the sensitive memory circuitry. This invention prevents the abnormal signal from reaching the memory block and reduces the cost of logic-hybrid memory systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment. The circuit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</cross-reference> show the first voltage control system, while the circuit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference> show the second voltage control system. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the first voltage control circuit and the second voltage control circuit as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> the circuit comprises a series of NAND gates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and an inverter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> A predetermined number of control signal lines IF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and IF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected to the input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These control signals correspond to the control signal line of the logic block in the logic-hybrid memory in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The output of NAND gate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the input of the NAND gates <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The output of RASBx, CASBx, and the NAND gate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are connected to the input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The output of the NAND gates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are connected to the input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The output of the NAND gates <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are connected to the input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the output of the NAND gates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the output of NAND gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the INRST shown in, and to the input of the inverter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The output of the inverter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is connected to the BINRST in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment, like first embodiment, prevents an abnormal signal from being sent as input to the semiconductor memory and prevents damaging the semiconductor memory.

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The third embodiment of voltage control is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This circuit is similar to the circuit illustrated as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. However, it differs from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> where the three inputs of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are RASBx&prime;, CASBx and the output from NAND gate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The signal of RASBx&prime; is generated by inputting RASBx into the circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The circuit illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is used to shape (wide or narrow) the width of the signal pulse. The circuit contains an inverter <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> receiving the signal RASBx. The output of the inverter <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> is split with one path becoming one of the input leads to NOR gate <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. The second path passes through the inverter chain <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> and also becomes one of the leads to the NOR gate <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. NOR gate <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> provides the output signal RASBx&prime; and becomes the RASBx&prime; signal input into NAND gate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates the timing chart of the circuit disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>.

The signal passing through node B is slightly delayed compared with the signal passing through node A. The amount of delay is defined as delay. A width of signal pulse RASBx is defined as tpulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) illustrates a waveform representing the case when tdelay&lt;tpulse which occurs when the memory block is operating normally. The waveform represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is the waveform of mode A synchronized to RASBx. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) illustrates the waveform representing the case where tdelay&gt;tpulse. This event occurs when the circuit in the logic block operates abnormally and produces a narrow width of signal pulse RASBx. The level of node A when compared to the level of node B does not produce an &ldquo;L&rdquo; simultaneously. Therefore, RASBx&prime; is fixed as &ldquo;L.&rdquo; Consequently, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is provided a signal fixed &ldquo;L&rdquo; when the width of the signal pulse of RASBx is very narrow. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, when the control signal lines IF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and IF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are &ldquo;H,&rdquo; simultaneously, an abnormal signal is assumed generated. </paragraph>

Consequently, RASBx is disconnected to RASBi. Since PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on, RASBi is connected to the predetermined potential VDD as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Also, CASBx is disconnected to CASBi. Since the PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on, CASBi is connected to the predetermined potential VDD as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. When the control signal lines IF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and IF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are simultaneously set to &ldquo;H&rdquo; CASBi and RASBi serve as &ldquo;H,&rdquo; and the memory block enters the standby state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> (2) During the time period t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> until t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>: </paragraph>

The abnormal signal is also prevented from passing through the transfer gates between t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> (3) After time period t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The third embodiment, the abnormal signal continues to be prevented from passing through the transfer gates illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> until the width of the signal pulse of RASBx returns to a normal value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When an abnormal signal is prevented from passing through RASBi and CASBi respectively, RASBi and CASBi can be made into the precharged potential VDD. When the PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> turns on, this causes the semiconductor memory to be in a stand-by state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the fourth embodiment, a voltage control circuit is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. This circuit comprises NAND gates <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and inverter <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The control signal lines IF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and IF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are input into NAND gate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. NAND gate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> acts as the abnormal signal detection circuit. An inverted signal of a control signal line RASBx, and the output of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are connected to the input terminal of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The output of NAND gate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is connected to the control signal line RASBi. An inverted signal of a control signal line CASBx, and the output of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are connected to the input terminal of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The output terminal of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is connected to the control signal line CASBi. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Since at least one of the control signal lines IF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and IF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are &ldquo;L,&rdquo; node <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> serves as &ldquo;H.&rdquo; Since one input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> serves as &ldquo;L,&rdquo; when RASBx is &ldquo;H,&rdquo; RASBi serves as &ldquo;H.&rdquo; Since one input of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> serves as &ldquo;H&rdquo; when RASBx is &ldquo;L,&rdquo; RASBi serves as &ldquo;L.&rdquo; When considering NAND gate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the timing chart of CASBi is similar to that of CASBx. Therefore, the state of RASBi and CASBi follow the states of RASBx and CASBx, regardless of the state of a control signal line (equal to the node <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>), respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> (2) The case IF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;&ldquo;H,&rdquo; IF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;&ldquo;H,&rdquo; and IF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&equals;&ldquo;H&rdquo; simultaneously, an abnormal signal is generated </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Since the potential of the node <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> serves as &ldquo;L,&rdquo; RASBi and CASBi serve as &ldquo;H&rdquo; (precharge potential), regardless of the states of RASBx and CASBx. When an abnormal signal is generated, RASBi and CASBi serve as &ldquo;H,&rdquo; and the semiconductor memory is in a standby state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A timing chart about the operation of the circuit is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows when all of the control signals IF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and IF<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are set to &ldquo;H,&rdquo; the RASBi and the CASBi serve as &ldquo;H,&rdquo; then the memory will be in a standby state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The circuit described in the fourth embodiment is simplified when compared to the first to third embodiments because the transfer gates illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> are not necessary. The memory block is disconnected to the logic block and the memory block maintains a precharge state until an external circuit (e.g., the logic block) operates correctly from immediately after the power source turns on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Although both RASB and CASB are intercepted in the middle, this intercept is permitted. However, since there are usually many elements connected to a word line than that connected to a bit line, therefore the fourth embodiment only applies to RASB. In logic-hybrid memory, since a logic circuit (e.g., NAND gate, or inverter) in the logic block requires a power source, it is often influenced by noise. This noise can produce abnormal signals that can damage various circuits. Therefore, all embodiments described in this invention apply to logic-hybrid memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Please note that while the specification in this invention has been described in relation to certain preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is capable of alternative embodiments and that certain embodiments described in this invention can be varied considerably without departing from the basic scope and principles of the invention. </paragraph>
