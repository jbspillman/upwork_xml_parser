<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a web processing system for slitting a wider web into a plurality of narrower webs for use as photographic photosensitive webs (films), and winding the narrower webs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, web processing systems have a web slitting device for slitting a wider web of film, paper, metal foil, or the like into a plurality of narrower webs, and a winding device for winding the narrower webs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The web processing systems also have a side edge delivery device for delivering side edges that are severed off the wider web when it is slit. Heretofore, the side edge delivery device comprises delivery rollers and nip rollers for nipping and delivering the side edges. For details, reference should be made to Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 8-257990, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the wider web is slit into the narrower webs by rotary blades, it is necessary for the side edge delivery device to apply a predetermined level of tension to the side edges in order to give highly accurate transverse dimensions to the narrower webs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> If the side edges were not tensioned or were tensioned excessively, then the wider web that reaches the rotary blades would be flexed, resulting in a reduction in the accuracy of the transverse dimensions of the narrower webs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One conventional side edge delivery device which is capable of applying tension to side edges (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;conventional side edge delivery device&rdquo;) is disclosed in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 10-6126, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The conventional side edge delivery device comprises nip rollers that are pressed against delivery rollers under a constant pressure by cylinders, and motors operatively coupled to the delivery rollers by respective clutches. The clutches are supplied with exciting currents that are variable to apply a desired tension to the side edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As described above, for imparting a desired tension to the side edges, the cylinders are connected to the respective nip rollers and the clutches are operatively coupled between the delivery rollers and the motors. However, the clutches are responsible for an increase in the manufacturing cost of the conventional side edge delivery device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The motors are rotated at a constant speed at all times, and the exciting currents of the clutches are controlled to set the side edge tension to a desired value. Therefore, while the slitting process is being suspended, the clutches slip at an increased speed, and hence tend to generate an increased amount of heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Winding devices that are in practical use for winding narrow webs having a small thickness ranging from 10 to 20 &mgr;m, e.g., &frac12;-inch and 8 mm magnetic tapes, have a tension fluctuation ratio of &plusmn;5% or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, winding devices for winding wide webs having a large thickness ranging from 100 to 150 &mgr;m, e.g., photographic photosensitive webs (films), with a low tension fluctuation ratio, have not yet been developed in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings, a conventional film winding device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> comprises a drive shaft <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> with an air tube <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> disposed therein, and a winding core <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> by bearings <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, for winding a film <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> therearound. The conventional film winding device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> also includes a displacement transmitting member <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> disposed around the air tube <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> within the winding core <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and having a felt pad <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> mounted on a radially outer surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When compressed air is introduced into the air tube <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, the air tube <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is expanded to displace the displacement transmitting member <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> radially outwardly for thereby pressing the felt pad <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> against an inner wall surface of the winding core <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> for slipping contact therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The torque that is generated when the felt pad <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> slips against the winding core <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is used as a tension applied to the film <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> when the film <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is wound around the winding core <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional film winding device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is disadvantageous in that the tension applied to the film <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is not stable and the tension fluctuation ratio can only be lowered to about &plusmn;15% even if the conventional film winding device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is well conditioned. Furthermore, the conventional film winding device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is unable to produce large tension because of its principles of operation. The maximum tension that can be generated by the conventional film winding device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is about 10 N at the most, when the width of a narrow web to be wound is 35 mm, for example. If more tension is produced, then the film <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> that is wound tends to be deformed due to the heat. Moreover, since the air tube <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is mounted in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the felt pad <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is attached to the radially outer surface of the displacement transmitting member <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, the conventional film winding device <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is complex in structure and its maintenance needs to be carried out by skillful operators. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a web processing system for winding relatively wide webs having a large thickness ranging from 100 to 150 &mgr;m, e.g., photographic photosensitive webs (films), with a low tension fluctuation ratio of &plusmn;5% or less, while producing large tension easily and stably, the web processing system being constructed for easy maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a web processing system which can be manufactured inexpensively and is capable of slitting a wider web into a plurality of narrower webs having highly accurate transverse dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of the present invention, a winding device of a web processing system has a drive shaft having a flange, and a holder rotatably mounted on the drive shaft in covering relation to the flange, for winding the web therearound, the holder comprising a first torque adjustment unit rotatably mounted on the drive shaft and having a surface disposed in facing relation to a surface of the flange, the first torque adjustment unit supporting a plurality of magnets on the surface thereof, and a second torque adjustment unit rotatably mounted on the drive shaft and having a surface disposed in facing relation to an opposite surface of the flange, the second torque adjustment unit supporting a plurality of magnets on the surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When the relative position of the first and second torque adjustment units is varied, the density of magnetic fluxes produced between the first and second torque adjustment units is varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When the drive shaft is rotated about its own axis, the flange positioned between the first and second torque adjustment units cuts the magnetic fluxes produced between the first and second torque adjustment units, generating eddy currents in the flange. Secondary magnetic fluxes produced in the flange by the eddy currents and the magnetic fluxes produced between the first and second torque adjustment units attract each other, producing a torque substantially proportional to a slipping speed, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a winding device of a web processing system comprises a drive shaft having a ring, an annular conductor pressed against and secured to an outer circumferential surface of the ring, and a holder rotatably mounted on the drive shaft in covering relation to the ring, for winding the web therearound, the holder supporting on an inner circumferential surface thereof a magnet row of a plurality of magnets, the magnet row facing the annular conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When the drive shaft is rotated about its own axis, the annular conductor cuts the magnetic fluxes produced between magnet rows, generating eddy currents in the annular conductor. Secondary magnetic fluxes produced in the flange by the eddy currents and the magnetic fluxes produced between the magnet rows attract each other, producing a torque substantially proportional to a slipping speed, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to still another aspect of the present invention, a winding device of a web processing system comprises a drive shaft having a torque transmitter, a support fixed to the torque transmitter, an annular conductor pressed against and secured to an outer circumferential surface of the support, and a holder rotatably mounted on the drive shaft in covering relation to the support, for winding the web therearound, the holder supporting on an inner circumferential surface thereof a magnet row of a plurality of magnets with a magnet holder, the magnet row facing the annular conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When the drive shaft is rotated about its own axis, the annular conductor cuts the magnetic fluxes produced between magnet rows, generating eddy currents in the annular conductor. Secondary magnetic fluxes produced in the flange by the eddy currents and the magnetic fluxes produced between the magnet rows attract each other, producing a torque substantially proportional to a slipping speed, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The number of magnets on the inner circumferential surface of the holder may be increased, and the magnets may be arranged in a plurality of magnet rows for changing the density of the magnetic fluxes generated between the magnet rows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the magnets be spaced at a constant pitch on the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Before the magnets are mounted in place, all the magnets may be measured for the strength of magnetic forces, and those magnets whose magnetic forces are weaker and those permanent magnets whose magnetic forces are stronger may be alternately arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Since the torque can be generated on the holder without contacting the holder, even when a wide web having a large thickness ranging from 100 to 150 &mgr;m, e.g., a photographic photosensitive web (film), is to be wound, a tension fluctuation ratio may be set to &plusmn;5% or less. Therefore, the winding device can produce large tensions easily and stably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Since any contact members such as felt pads are not present, and no air tube is mounted in the drive shaft, it is not necessary to take into account the service life of wearable components, and hence the maintenance of the winding device is facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is preferable to provide cooling means for cooling at least the drive shaft and the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> If a narrow web having a small thickness ranging from 10 to 20 &mgr;m is to be wound, then since any tension required to be applied thereto may be small, the amount of heat generated in the winding process is small, and the web can be cooled by natural air cooling. However, if a wide web having a large thickness ranging from 100 to 150 &mgr;m, e.g., a photographic photosensitive web (film), is to be wound, then since the amount of heat generated in the winding process is large, the wound web may tend to be deformed due to the heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The cooling means is capable of effectively dissipating the heat generated in the winding process. Therefore, the winding device is effective to prevent the wound web from being deformed due to the heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The drive shaft may have a hollow space defined therein, and the cooling means may have cooling air introducing means for introducing cooling air from outside of the holder into the holder and the hollow space in the drive shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The cooling means may have cooling fins mounted on a surface of the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The cooling air introducing means may comprise a first cooling air passage for guiding the cooling air into the holder, and a second cooling air passage disposed in a portion of the drive shaft covered by the holder for guiding the cooling air introduced into the holder into the hollow space in the drive shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a web processing system has at least a web slitting device for slitting a wider web into a plurality of narrower webs, the web slitting device comprising a rotary blade assembly for slitting a wider web which is being fed, along the direction of feed into a plurality of narrower webs, and side edge delivery means for delivering side edges produced from the wider web when the wider web is slit into the narrower webs, the side edge delivery means comprising a side edge delivery roller rotatable in a direction to deliver the side edges, a nip roller rotatable with the side edge delivery roller while gripping the side edges between the side edge delivery roller and the nip roller, and a nip roller pressing mechanism for pressing the nip roller against the side edge delivery roller under a predetermined pressure, the side edge delivery roller being rotatable at a peripheral speed higher than a peripheral speed of the rotary blade assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The nip roller pressing mechanism may comprises a cylinder for displacing the nip roller in a direction toward the side edge delivery roller or a direction away from the side edge delivery roller, and a regulator for regulating an air pressure supplied to the cylinder to control the pressure under which the nip roller is pressed against the side edge delivery roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The peripheral speed of the side edge delivery roller may be higher than the peripheral speed of the rotary blade assembly by a value ranging from 0.5% to 5%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The pressure applied from the nip roller to the side edge delivery roller is adjusted to apply a predetermined tension to the side edges. Consequently, the narrower webs are prevented from suffering an error in their transverse dimensions as when the tension applied to the side edges is released or the tension applied to the side edges becomes greater than the tension applied to the narrower webs. Therefore, if the narrower webs are used as movie films or photographic negative films, then they assure high image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The web processing system may further comprise a motor and a pair of speed reducer mechanisms, the rotary blade assembly and the side edge delivery roller being operatively coupled to the motor via the speed reducer mechanisms, respectively. This arrangement allows the web slitting device to be manufactured relatively inexpensively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Tension adjustment devices (not shown) are positioned upstream and downstream of the web slitting device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for applying a predetermined tension to the wider web <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> introduced into the web slitting device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> discharged from the web slitting device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The web slitting device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a rotary blade assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprising a lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> has a plurality of annular grooves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> axially spaced at intervals that are selected to meet transverse dimensions of web products to be obtained. The upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are in the form of disks and fixedly mounted on a shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> at respective positions vertically aligned with the respective grooves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A pulley <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is fixed to an end of the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and operatively coupled by a belt <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> to a pulley <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> which is operatively coupled by a belt <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> to a pulley <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> that is fixedly mounted on a drive shaft <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of a motor <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>. When the motor <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> is energized to rotate the drive shaft <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, the rotation of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is transmitted via the belt <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, the pulley <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, the belt <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, and the pulley <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, which is rotated. The belt <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, the pulley <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, the belt <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, and the pulley <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> jointly make up a first speed reducer mechanism <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the motor <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> is energized by a current supplied from a driver <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> to which a control signal is supplied from a controller <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> rotates to generate a torque depending on the current supplied from the driver <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> based on the control signal from the controller <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> gear <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is mounted on the other end of the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and held in mesh with a gear <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> mounted on an end of the shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> on which the upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are fixedly mounted. Therefore, the rotation of the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> causes the meshing gears <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> to rotate the shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and hence the upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> in unison with the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> have respective outer circumferential edges entering the respective grooves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> in the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, thereby slitting the wider web <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> whose widths correspond to the respective spacings between the grooves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and the upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an upper blade pressing mechanism <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> is connected to the shaft <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> for pressing the upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> into the grooves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> in the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> can be displaced toward and away from the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> by the upper blade pressing mechanism <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> web feed roller <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> is disposed upstream of the rotary blade assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A side edge delivery device (side edge delivery means) <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is disposed downstream of the rotary blade assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at opposite ends of the wider web <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The side edge delivery device <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> serves to deliver side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> which are left from the wider web <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when the wider web <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is slit into the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, to a side edge processing device (not shown). The side edge delivery device <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> has a side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> having a shaft <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> on which a pulley <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is mounted. The pulley <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is operatively coupled by a belt <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> to a pulley <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of the motor <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>. When the motor <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> is energized, the rotation of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is transmitted via the pulley <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, the belt <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight>, and the pulley <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> to the shaft <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, which rotates the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. The pulley <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight>, the belt <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight>, and the pulley <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> jointly make up a third speed reducer mechanism <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The ratio of the diameters of the pulleys <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, i.e., the pulley ratio, is selected such that the peripheral speed of the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> is higher than the peripheral speed of the upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> by a value ranging from 0.5% to 5.0%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The side edge delivery device <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> has a pair of nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> rotatable in unison with the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> while the side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> are being gripped between the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> and the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. Each of the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> has a shaft <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> rotatably supported on a pair of spaced arms <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>angularly movable about a pivot shaft <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. A rod <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> extends between and is fixed to the arms <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at ends thereof remote from the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>. A cylinder <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> has a rod <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> fixed to a substantially central portion of the rod <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> regulator <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> is connected to the cylinders <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> for supplying air from a pump <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to the cylinders <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight>. The air supplied from the regulator <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> actuates the cylinders <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> to angularly displace the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> toward or away from the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The regulator <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> regulates the pressure of air supplied to the cylinder <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> based on a control signal from the controller <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The pressure applied to the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> by the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> is controlled by the air pressure regulated by the regulator <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight>. Depending on the pressure thus controlled, the tension applied to the side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> upstream of the side edge delivery device <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is controlled so as to be substantially equal to the tension applied to the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, for example. The tension applied to the side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> is controlled because the frictional forces generated between the side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> and the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> vary depending on the pressure applied to the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> by the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>. The side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> is made of a metal material, for example, and the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> are made of a synthetic resin or rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The web slitting device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> according to the embodiment of the present invention is basically constructed as described above. Operation and advantages of the web slitting device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> When the motor <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> is energized with the upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> inserted in the respective grooves <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> in the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> by the upper blade pressing mechanism <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>, the rotary blade assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the web feed roller <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>, and the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> are rotated respectively by the first speed reducer mechanism <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>, the second speed reducer mechanism <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, and the third speed reducer mechanism <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>. The wider web <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> supplied to the rotary blade assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by the web feed roller <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> is slit into the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, and the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are delivered to the winding devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> which are left from the wider web <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when the wider web <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is slit into the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are delivered by the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> to the side edge processing device (not shown). At this time, the side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> are gripped under a predetermined pressure between the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> and the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. The pressure applied to the side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> is controlled when the air pressure supplied to the cylinders <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> connected to the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> is regulated by the regulator <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The peripheral speed of the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> is selected to be higher than the peripheral speed of the upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> by a value ranging from 0.5% to 5.0%. Therefore, the pressure applied from the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> to the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> can be regulated to control the tension applied to the side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the peripheral speed of the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> is selected to be higher than the peripheral speed of the upper blades <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and the lower blade <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> by a value ranging from 0.5% to 5.0%. The pressure applied from the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> to the side edge delivery roller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> is controlled when the air pressure supplied to the cylinders <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> connected to the nip rollers <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> is regulated by the regulator <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are prevented from suffering an error in their transverse dimensions as when the tension applied to the side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> is released or the tension applied to the side edges <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> becomes greater than the tension applied to the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Therefore, if the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are used as movie films or photographic negative films, then they assure high image quality. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment comprises a drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> having a flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in covering relation to the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, for winding the narrower web <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> therearound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has an axially extending hollow space <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> defined therein. The flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is made of metal, or more specifically has a central portion made of sheet steel and a surrounding portion of copper or copper alloy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has a first torque adjustment plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by a first bearing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on one side of the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a second torque adjustment plate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by a second bearing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> on the other side of the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a winding core <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> by which the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are fixed to each other at any arbitrary relative position and which winds the narrower web <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> therearound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The first torque adjustment plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has a surface disposed in facing relation to a surface of the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and supports a plurality of permanent magnets <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on the surface thereof that are spaced at a constant pitch. The second torque adjustment plate <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has a surface disposed in facing relation to an opposite surface of the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and supports a plurality of permanent magnets <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> on the surface thereof that are spaced at a constant pitch. The first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are supported in the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> such that the distances L between the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be varied as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment also has a cooling means <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for cooling at least the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The cooling means <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> comprises first cooling holes <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> defined in the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, second cooling holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> defined in a portion of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> covered by the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and a suction device (not shown) connected to an end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> When the suction device is actuated, ambient cooling air is introduced via the first cooling holes <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> into the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and then introduced via the second cooling holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> into the hollow space <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The cooling means <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> thus functions to introduce cooling air from outside of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> into the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the hollow space <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment is basically constructed as described above. Operation and advantages of the winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> When the relative position of the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is varied, the density of magnetic fluxes produced between the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> When the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is rotated about its own axis, the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> positioned between the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> cuts the magnetic fluxes produced between the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, generating eddy currents in the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Secondary magnetic fluxes produced in the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by the eddy currents and the magnetic fluxes produced between the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> attract each other, producing a torque substantially proportional to a slipping speed, for example. The slipping speed represents the difference between the rotational speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the rotational speed of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Since the torque can be generated on the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> without contacting the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, even when a wide web having a large thickness ranging from 100 to 150 &mgr;m, e.g., a photographic photosensitive web (film), is to be wound, a tension fluctuation ratio may be set to &plusmn;5% or less with respect to a tension of 2 kg, for example. Therefore, the winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can produce large tensions easily and stably. For example, the winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can produce large tensions ranging from 500 g to 3 kg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Inasmuch as the winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can produce stable winding tensions, the wound web suffers a relatively small transverse displacement. For example, the transverse displacement of the wound web can be reduced from a conventional value of 3 mm to a value ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 mm. As a result, the wound web has a neatly coiled appearance free of appearance defects. The winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is suitable for use in winding a narrow web having a relatively large thickness ranging from 50 to 300 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The torque is determined depending on the strength of the magnetic fields produced by the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> on the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the distances between the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and the speed of the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which cuts the magnetic fluxes generated between the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The torque can easily be set to a desired value by changing these parameters, i.e., the strength of the magnetic fields, the distances, and the speed of the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, since any contact members such as felt pads are not present, and no air tube is mounted in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, it is not necessary to take into account the service life of wearable components, and hence the maintenance of the winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> If a narrow web having a small thickness ranging from 10 to 20 &mgr;m is to be wound, then since any tension required to be applied thereto may be small, the amount of heat generated in the winding process is small, and the web can be cooled by natural air cooling. However, if a wide web having a large thickness ranging from 100 to 150 &mgr;m, e.g., a photographic photosensitive web (film), is to be wound, then since the amount of heat generated in the winding process is large, the wound web may tend to be deformed due to the heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment has the cooling means <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for effectively dissipating the heat generated in the winding process. Therefore, the winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is effective to prevent the wound web from being deformed due to the heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment, the cooling means <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> has the first cooling holes <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> defined in the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and the second cooling holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> defined in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and cooling air is introduced from outside of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> into the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the hollow space <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Because the air thus introduced can remove dust particles from within the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the rotatable components of the winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are effectively prevented from being unduly worn by dust particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> For the production of photographic films, the narrower webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are wound by the corresponding winding devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, any torque variations between the winding devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> should preferably be eliminated. In the first embodiment, the slipping speed N is constant, and the distances L between the first and second torque adjustment plates <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the flange <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are equalized to a constant value. These parameter settings can reduce any torque variations between the winding devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a value ranging from about 2 to 3%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the two bearings <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are used in the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In order to reduce torque variations between the bearings <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the bearings <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are degreased in a cleaning process, and then lubricated by several drops of oil whose viscosity ranges from SAE <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the cooling means <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may comprise cooling fins <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> on the surface of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The cooling fins <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be or may not be combined with the first and second cooling holes <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> If the cooling fins <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are employed, a nozzle should preferably be provided to apply air to the cooling fins <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The cooling fins <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are effective to increase the cooling capability of the cooling means <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, thus allowing the winding device to wind wider and thicker webs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> There is an ideal tension curve for winding the web <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When the web <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is wound by the winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the diameter of the web <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> coiled on the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> gradually increases, resulting in a reduction in the rotational speed of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As the rotational speed of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> decreases, the tension decreases as indicated by the tension curve a in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> away from an ideal tension curve b. Therefore, the rotational speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, which is normally constant, is increased by 20 through 30% to bring the tension curve a closely to the ideal tension curve b. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Different materials and dimensions of webs <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be wound on the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> have different tension curves b. However, by selecting the rotational speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> depending on the diameter of the web coil, as described above, the tension curve of a certain web to be wound can be brought closely to the optimum tension curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The winding device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the winding device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment comprises a drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, a ring <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of metal fixedly mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and having a certain axial width, and a substantially cylindrical holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in covering relation to the ring <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, for winding the narrower web <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> therearound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> has an axially extending hollow space <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> defined therein.

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> A plurality of permanent magnets <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> are mounted on an inner surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> which radially confronts the ring <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The permanent magnets <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> are spaced at a constant pitch and arrayed in permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and the annular copper sheet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> face each other radially of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> by a first bearing <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and a second bearing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, and supports on its outer surface a winding core <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> for winding the web <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> therearound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The winding device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has a cooling means <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> for cooling at least the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The cooling means <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> comprises first cooling holes <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> defined in the holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, second cooling holes <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> defined in the ring <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, third cooling holes <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> defined in a portion of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> which is covered by the ring <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, and a suction device (not shown) connected to an end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Operation and advantages of the winding device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Magnetic fluxes are generated by magnetic forces of the permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> disposed on the inner surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> When the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is rotated about its own axis, the ring <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> fixed to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> rotates in unison with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and the annular copper sheet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> pressed against the ring <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> cuts the magnetic fluxes generated between the permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, generating eddy currents in the ring <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Secondary magnetic fluxes by the eddy currents and the magnetic fluxes produced between the permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> attract each other, producing a torque substantially proportional to a slipping speed, for example. The slipping speed represents the difference between the rotational speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the rotational speed of the holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Since the torque can be generated on the holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> without contacting the holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, even when a wide web having a large thickness ranging from 100 to 150 &mgr;m, e.g., a photographic photosensitive web (film), is to be wound, a tension fluctuation ratio may be set to &plusmn;5% or less. Therefore, the winding device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can produce large tensions easily and stably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Inasmuch as the stable winding tension can be produced, any transverse displacement of the wound web or a web coil appearance defect can be reduced. For example, such transverse displacement of the wound web can be reduced from a conventional value ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 mm to a value ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 mm. As a result, undue wear of the edges of wound webs, which would otherwise occur due to abrasive contact with each other, is eliminated, and the web coils suffer less damage on their edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The winding device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is not limited to winding the photographic photosensitive webs (films), but is suitable for use in winding a wide web of paper, cloth, etc. having a relatively large thickness ranging from 50 to 300 &mgr;m and a width ranging from 15 to 70 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The winding device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment has the cooling means <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> which functions to introduce cooling air from outside of the holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> into the holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the hollow space <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Because the annular copper sheet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which is a source of heat generated when the web <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is wound, is pressed against the ring <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> fixedly mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> that is a last component to be cooled by the introduced air, the holder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is cooled without being thermally affected. The cooling air which has been heated by the annular copper sheet <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is discharged out of the winding device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> without thermally affecting the other components. Therefore, the cooling capability of the cooling means <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is increased to prevent the would web <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from being unduly deformed. </paragraph>

Seamless annular copper sheets <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> are pressed against and secured to respective outer surfaces of the supports <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> remote from the torque transmitter <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. The holder <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> has circumferential surfaces <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> on which a plurality of permanent magnets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are mounted by magnetic holders <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The permanent magnets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are spaced at a constant pitch and arrayed in permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The annular copper sheets <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> and the permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> face each other radially of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The winding device <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> has a cooling means <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> for cooling at least the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and the holder <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The cooling means <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> comprises cooling holes <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> defined through the torque transmitter <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, and a suction device (not shown) connected to an end of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> When the suction device is actuated, ambient cooling air is introduced via gaps between the copper sheets <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> pressed against the supports <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and the permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and gaps between the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to the holder <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, and then via the cooling holes <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> into the hollow space <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. Ambient cooling air is also introduced via the hollow spaces <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in the supports <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> to the holder <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, and then via the cooling holes <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> into the hollow space <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the cooling means <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> thus functions to introduce cooling air from outside of the holder <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> into the holder <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and the hollow space <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The winding device <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment is basically constructed as described above. Operation and advantages of the winding device <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> When the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is rotated about its own axis, the torque transmitter <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> fixedly mounted on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is rotated in unison with the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, and the copper sheets <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> pressed against the supports <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> fixedly mounted on the torque transmitter <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> cut the magnetic fluxes generated by the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Therefore, eddy currents are generated in the copper sheets <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, and secondary magnetic fluxes by the eddy currents and the magnetic fluxes produced by the permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> attract each other, producing a torque substantially proportional to a slipping speed, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The cooling means <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of the winding device <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is effective to dissipate the heat generated when the winding device <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> winds the narrower web <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, the torque transmitter <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, the supports <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, and the annular copper sheets <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> are integrally held together, and made of metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the heat generated by the annular copper sheets <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, which are a heat source at the time the web is wound, can easily be transferred via the supports <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and the torque transmitter <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> for increased cooling efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, the two bearings <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> are used in the holder <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. In order to reduce torque variations between the bearings <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, the bearings <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> are degreased in a cleaning process, and then lubricated by several drops of oil whose viscosity ranges from SAE <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, before the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are mounted at a constant pitch on the circumferential surfaces, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> by the magnetic holders <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, all the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are measured for the strength of magnetic forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, when the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are to be installed on the holder <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> by the magnetic holders <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and arrayed as the permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, those permanent magnets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> whose magnetic forces are weaker and those permanent magnets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> whose magnetic forces are stronger are alternately arranged to uniformize the strengths of the magnetic forces generated by the permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. It is preferable to employ as many permanent magnets <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> as possible to provide the permanent magnet rows <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> As a consequence, the magnetic forces are uniformized in balance, and the density of the magnetic fluxes is increased, so that the slipping speed can be lowered and the amount of generated heat can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The above advantages hold true for the above second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The holder <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> should preferably have a stopper for preventing the winding core <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> from being unduly displaced axially, and a pin for preventing the winding core <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> from being unduly displaced circumferentially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> An experimental example of the winding device according to the first embodiment will be described below. In the experimental example, tension fluctuation ratios were measured with respect to inventive and comparative examples. Each of the inventive and comparative examples had the same structure as the winding device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment. In the inventive example, the cooling means <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is operated, i.e., the suction device is actuated. In the comparative example, the cooling means <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is not operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In the inventive example, several measuring positions were determined, and the tension was measured for variations at the measuring positions when the slipping speed, i.e., the difference between the rotational speed of the drive shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the rotational speed of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, gradually increased. The measured results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The measuring positions were at the web coil diameter of 150 mm (- &diams; -), the web coil diameter of 200 mm (- &squf; -), the web coil diameter of 250 mm (- &Dgr; -), and the web coil diameter of 300 mm (- &times; -). It can be seen from the measured results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> that the tension is substantially proportional to the slipping speed at each of the measuring positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In the comparative example (no cooling effected), the tension was monitored for variations with time and the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> was monitored for variations with time at the web coil diameter of 200 mm. The slipping speed was fixed to 50 rpm. The measures results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the curve a (- &Dgr; -) represents variations of the tension, and the curve b (- &times; -) represents variations of the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> It can be understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> that when the slipping speed is low, the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the tension are substantially constant even if the winding device is not cooled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> However, when the slipping speed increased, if the winding device was not cooled, then the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> increased with time, and the tension decreased accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Specifically, in the comparative example (no cooling effected), the tension was monitored for variations with time and the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> was monitored for variations with time at the web coil diameter of 600 mm. The slipping speed was fixed to 200 rpm. The measures results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the curve a (- &Dgr; -) represents variations of the tension, and the curve b (- &times; -) represents variations of the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> that the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> was initially about 35&deg; C. and the tension was initially 1.7 kg, and upon elapse of 20 minutes, the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> increased to about 60&deg; C. and the tension decreased to 1.4 kg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In the inventive example (cooling effected), the tension was monitored for variations with time and the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> was monitored for variations with time at the web coil diameter of 600 mm. The measures results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the curve a (- &Dgr; -) represents variations of the tension at a slipping speed of 150 rpm, the curve b (- &xcirc; -) represents variations of the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at a slipping speed of 150 rpm, the curve c (- &utrif; -) represents variations of the tension at a slipping speed of 200 rpm, and the curve d (- &Circlesolid; -) represents variations of the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at a slipping speed of 200 rpm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> A review of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> indicates that at the slipping speed of 150 rpm, the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> was initially about 30&deg; C. and the tension was initially 1.4 kg, and upon elapse of 20 minutes, the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> increased only to about 37&deg; C. and the tension remained substantially constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> At the slipping speed of 200 rpm, the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> was initially about 37&deg; C. and the tension was initially 1.7 kg, and upon elapse of 20 minutes, the temperature of the holder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> increased to about 50&deg; C. and the tension dropped to 1.5 kg. These fluctuation ratios of the temperature and the tension are much smaller than those of the comparative example (no cooling effected). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> As described above, the winding device according to the present invention is capable of winding wide webs having a large thickness ranging from 100 to 150 &mgr;m, e.g., photographic photosensitive webs (films), with a low tension fluctuation ratio of &plusmn;5% or less, while producing large tension easily and stably. The maintenance of the winding device according to the present invention is facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Although certain preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described in detail, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
