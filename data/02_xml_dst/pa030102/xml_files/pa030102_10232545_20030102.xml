<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A memory cell selection scheme that permits simultaneous reading and writing of cells in different memory blocks by using separate routing for bias voltages to the cells. A read path and a program path are used to separately route the read and program voltages to a memory block. Separate read and program transistors are used to selectively route one of those two voltages to a regional voltage line, where individual local voltage transistors can selectively route voltage from the regional voltage line to local voltage lines. By placing a separate set of read and program transistors in each block, each block can be configured to conduct either read or program operations without regard to which of those functions is being performed in other blocks. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention pertains generally to computers. In particular, it pertains to computer memory circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Flash memory is a type of rewritable memory that stores data in each cell by charging up a floating transistor gate to a predetermined charge level, which the transistor can then retain for an extended period of time. Each cell, which can be represented by a single transistor, can be 1) programmed (written) by charging up the floating gate of the transistor to a predetermined level, 2) read by sensing the amount of stored charge in the floating gate, and 3) erased by draining the stored charge from the transistor. Each of these functions requires a different set of bias voltage on the transistor. As an example, one type of flash memory requires voltages on the gate/source/drain, respectively, of approximately 10/0/5 for programming, &minus;9/0/0 for erasing, and 5/0/1 for reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To save valuable space on the die, large numbers of these cells have common connections so that a single voltage line may connect multiple gates, another single voltage line may connect multiple drains, and another single voltage line may connect multiple sources. Each of these groups of connections can then be serviced by a single, switchable voltage supply, so that all common connections in a group can have the same bias voltage and the entire group of cells can be biased for the same function of program, read, or erase. By connecting these common voltage lines in a column/row matrix, individual cells can be addressed, while still minimizing the amount of die space devoted to these interconnections. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example of six memory cells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which can be a small subset of a much larger block of thousands of cells. The sources of all six are connected together by a common source line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which can supply a common source voltage to all six cells. The gates of cells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected to one common gate line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, while the gates of cells <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are connected to another common gate line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that either cells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or cells <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be selected by placing the proper voltage on one of these common gate lines. The drains of cells <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are likewise connected to one common drain line <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, cells <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to a second common drain line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and cells <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to a third common drain line <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. To select a single cell, the source, gate, and drain lines to that particular cell are activated. For example, by placing proper read voltages on source line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, gate line <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and drain line <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, only cell <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> would have all the proper bias voltage for reading, and any value detected during the read operation would be attributed to cell <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Due to the preferred method of organizing cells, the common gate lines are typically referred to as wordlines, and the common drain lines are typically referred to as bitlines. A typical memory may have many cells grouped together in a block in the manner described. For example, in a flash memory, each wordline may be connected to 512 cells, and each bitline may be connected to 1024 cells, for a total of over 0.5 million cells per block, with eight blocks in a plane. Multiple planes can be combined into a memory array. The array, plane, block, word, and bit numbers can be decoded from a memory address to select the particular cell that is being addressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Global voltage lines are typically switched on or off separately to each array, so that cells in each array can be programmed, read, or erased independently of the other arrays. However, within each array, all planes may be required to perform the same function if the cells in those arrays are addressed at the same time, due to their common global voltage line. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a conventional bitline selection circuit for an array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in which a switch or multiplexer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can switch the drain voltage for either a read operation (read voltage VR), or a program operation (program voltage VP) to array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Within the array, transistor switch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can connect that voltage to global bitline GBL, or disconnect it if that voltage is not needed in the array at that time. Since the same global bitline goes to multiple planes and to all blocks <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, etc., within those planes, these planes and blocks are all simultaneously biased for only one of the functions of program, read, and erase. Within Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, transistors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (through <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, where n is the highest-numbered bitline) can direct that voltage to any of local bitlines LBL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, etc., where the voltage can be provided to any of the memory cells <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>x </italic></highlight>(only one cell is shown in the drawing for clarity) that are connected to that bitline and that are selected by the appropriate wordline (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Bitlines <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be considered local bitlines. At the same time, each of Blocks <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, etc. will have their own equivalent of transistors <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, etc., so that each block can simultaneously select a different local bitline, and therefore a different memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This conventional addressing scheme prevents memory cells in the same array from performing different operations at the same time, since the global bitline provides the same bitline bias voltage to the blocks and planes within an array. Thus a read-while-write function (read one cell while programming another) cannot be performed unless the read and write operations take place in different arrays, with each array typically representing 10&apos;s of megabits of addressable memory. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the invention can permit different blocks within a single memory plane to perform different operations at the same time by allowing each block to be individually selected for different operations. For example, one block within the memory plane can perform a read operation while another block within the same memory plane can perform a program operation at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of a memory array <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in which a bitline path to one or more memory cells is selected to provide a bias voltage to the cell(s). Although the description is written in terms of bitline paths, the description can also apply to other paths, such as wordline paths. The various lines and transistors can be generically referred to as selection lines and selection transistors to encompass embodiments that use bitlines, wordlines, or other applicable memory selection lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A read voltage VR from a voltage source can be provided to the circuit by using transistor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to switch the read voltage onto global read bitline GRBL. This read voltage can be the voltage level that is appropriate for the bitline of a memory cell when a read operation is being performed on that memory cell. A program voltage VP from another voltage source can be provided to the circuit by using transistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to switch the program voltage onto global program bitline GPBL. This program voltage can be the voltage level that is appropriate for the bitline of a memory cell when a program (i.e., write) operation is being performed on that memory cell. The global lines GRBL and GPBL can extend to multiple blocks in a memory chip. In one embodiment, GRBL and GPBL extend to all the blocks in a plane, with multiple planes on the memory chip, each plane having its own equivalent of GRBL and GPBL. The number of planes per memory array, blocks per plane, and memory cells per block may vary, depending of the organizational structure designed into the memory. These terms are used in the art to define a hierarchy of elements in the structure, but the exact number of each type of element may vary, and is not critical to the practice of the invention, as will be understood by those of skill in the art. One embodiment has eight blocks per plane, with each block containing approximately half a million memory cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows three memory blocks <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, labeled Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, Block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and Block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, with the arrows at the bottom of the figure implying that GRBL and GPBL can extend to more blocks that have been excluded from the figure to avoid making the drawing overly complex. In one embodiment, all of these blocks are in a single plane. If none of the blocks in the plane are undergoing an operation, transistors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can both be turned off to reduce power consumption. If any block in the plane is undergoing a read operation, transistor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be turned on to supply the read voltage to GRBL. If any block in the plane is undergoing a program operation, transistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be turned on to supply the program voltage to GPBL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Additional internal circuitry is shown for Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, which may be typical of the remaining blocks. A read selection transistor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> can be used to selectively switch the read voltage on GRBL onto a regional bitline (RBL). Alternatively, a program selection transistor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can be used to selectively switch the program voltage onto the regional bitline RBL. If no operation is being performed on any cell in the block, transistors <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can both be turned off. However, transistors <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> should not be turned on at the same time, as this could short the read voltage to the program voltage and potentially cause damage to the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Local selection transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> can be used to connect the voltage on RBL to local bitline <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (LBL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>). If transistor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is on and transistor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is off, a read voltage will be on RBL and therefore connected to LBL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. If transistor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is on and transistor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is off, a program voltage will be on RBL and therefore connected to LBL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. A group of multiple memory cells <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>x </italic></highlight>can be connected to LBL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. For clarity, only one such cell is shown in the drawing, but in one embodiment, there are 512 memory cells connected to LBL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. Wordline connections can be used to select only one of these 512 cells for a particular operation, as is known to those of skill in the art. Local selection transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be used to connect the voltage on RBL to local bitline <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (LBL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), in a manner analogous to LBL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. LBL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can also have a group of multiple memory cells (not shown) connected to it. Local selection transistors <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can perform similar functions for local bitlines LBL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and LBL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which can have similar groups of memory cells connected to them. In one embodiment, each local bitline can have its own group of 512 memory cells connected to it. With this structure, a read voltage on GRBL can be passed on to any of the groups of memory cells on any of the local bitlines in Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, and one or more memory cells within the selected group can be further selected for a read operation by activating the proper wordline and source connections, which can be arranged in the matrix format exemplified by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Alternatively, a program voltage on GPBL can be passed on to any of the groups of memory cells on the local bitlines in Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Each of the other blocks (Block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and additional blocks not shown) in the plane can have their own read selection transistor, program selection transistor, regional bitline, local selection transistors, and local bitlines, in a manner analogous to Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. Since each block can separately and individually select either the read voltage or the program voltage for its own regional bitline, and pass that voltage on to any of its local bitlines and individual memory cells, each block may read or program independently of whether the other blocks in the plane are doing likewise. For example, Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> might perform a read operation while Block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is performing a program operation. Further, the indicated read and program operations can overlap completely in time, or can overlap only partially in time, with a portion of the read operation being performed while a portion of the program operation is being performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the source connections of all the memory cells in a block are effectively coupled together, while the wordlines of a single row (refer to wordline <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are coupled together but are not tied to the other wordlines in the block. Using this configuration, a single memory cell on a single local bitline in the block can be selected for reading (or programming) without selecting any of the other cells in the block, and without regard to whether a read or program operation is being performed in another block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an alternate embodiment in which the ability to program and read independently is extended to the sub-block level. In a manner similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, transistors <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be used to place the read voltage VR and program voltage VP onto GRBL and GPBL, respectively. Transistors <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be used to place one of those two voltages onto regional bitline RBL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and from there the voltage can selectively be placed onto local bitlines LBL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through LBL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by selectively turning on transistors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Memory cell <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>x </italic></highlight>represents one of multiple memory cells that are connected to each of the local bitlines LBL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through LBL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and can be individually enabled by selectively turning on the proper wordlines (not shown). Blocks <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, etc., can have similar circuitry, as was previously described for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. This portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is basically the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, except that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, all of the local bitlines in Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> can be connected to RBL through their respective local selection transistors. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> subset of all the local bitlines in Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> can be connected to RBL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, while another subset of those bitlines can be connected to a second regional bitline RBL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which can receive a read voltage through read selection transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or a program voltage through program selection transistor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Local selection transistors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can then be used to selectively switch this voltage to local bitlines LBL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> through LBL<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, each of which can have multiple memory cells <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>y </italic></highlight>(only one such cell is shown for clarity). Thus Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> can have two regional bitlines, each of which can independently receive/distribute either the read voltage or the program voltage, without regard to which voltage the other regional bitline is receiving/distributing. The illustrated embodiment shows two regional bitlines, each with 4 local bitlines coupled to it. Other embodiments can have as many regional bitlines as is practical, each with as many local bitlines as is practical. In one embodiment, each block can have 32 regional bitlines, with each regional bitline having 32 local bitlines connected to it. Each of the remaining blocks in a plane can essentially duplicate the circuitry of Block <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a read-while-write operation (read one memory cell while programming another) can take place not only within the same memory plane, but also within the same memory block. Alternatively, the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> can be used to reduce the number of local selection transistors being driven by each read or program selection transistor, while maintaining a restriction of not performing a read-while-write within a single memory block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a flow chart of a method embodiment, in which a memory cell in a first block of a memory plane is selected for reading while a different memory cell in a second block of the same memory plane is selected for programming. As stated at flow chart element <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the process described in elements <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be performed in a time frame that overlaps the time frame in which the process of elements <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are performed.
