The differential receiver is any number of devices including a differential clock receiver. The differential signals may be referenced to voltages used to receiver power supply voltages. The present invention obviates the need for an additional differential driver and its required additional devices that are needed to perform transformation of a single ended signal to a pair of differential signals.

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/773,879, entitled &ldquo;Single to Differential Interfacing&rdquo;, and filed on Jan. 31, 2001. The disclosure is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to device interfacing; and, more particularly, it relates to interfacing a single ended device to a device employing differential inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There is a movement in the art towards devices that use or require differential inputs. There have been some conventional approaches that have sought to perform the interfacing of a single ended signal to a device necessitating differential inputs. One conventional approach seeks to isolate signals. This is done by separating traces on a printed circuit board (PCB) and by providing extra ground paths through connectors or in and out of integrated circuit (IC) packages. One deficiency in this approach is that isolating these signals does not eliminate shared paths altogether. Cross-talk between the signals is reduced, but it may not be completely eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another conventional approach uses a differential driver that provides source and return connections for every signal. This second conventional approach allows cross-talk problems to be somewhat minimized, since each signal has its own dedicated return path. However, using these differential drivers necessitates special devices and more pins within a system, thereby increasing real estate consumption, cost, and complexity within a system. In certain applications where these constraints are rigid, the incremental addition of cost and complexity may make it impracticable to use such a conventional solution. The use of these differential drivers requires the use of other special devices more pins to perform the proper interfacing. This conventional approach is exemplary of a brute force method that puts little emphasis on cost savings in any number of terms including: money, real estate, and complexity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional systems will become apparent to one of skill in the art through comparison of such systems with the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Various aspects of the present invention can be found in a single to differential interface. The single to differential interface includes a first isolated power and ground plane and a second isolated power and ground plane. The first isolated power and ground plane generates a single ended source output having a first current magnitude. The second isolated power and ground plane is communicatively coupled to the first isolated power and ground plane via a substantially transmission-like connection. The second isolated power and ground plane receives a pair of differential signals.

One of the transmission lines has a first characteristic impedance and at least one other of the transmission lines has a second characteristic impedance. The first current magnitude and the second current magnitude are substantially of a common magnitude. The substantially transmission-like connection includes a number of connection types including a trace on a printed circuit board. The substantially transmission-like connection is operable across a predetermined frequency range at which the single ended source output is operable to be modulated.

The single to differential interface also includes a floating power supply that biases the single ended source. In other embodiments, a current being transmitted from the single ended source includes a magnitude that is substantially equal to a magnitude of a current that is received by the single ended source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Other aspects of the present invention can be found in a single to differential interface method. The method includes referencing a single ended source output signal to a floating single ended source ground, implementing a differential interface that is referenced to a system ground, and referencing a number of differential signals to a number of receiver power supply voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments of the invention, one of the differential signals is referenced to one of a voltage logic level low or a voltage logic level high. The method also includes using uniform impedance control, and the uniform impedance control is operable to ensure a single return current path. The method also includes connecting a first isolated power and ground plane to a second isolated power and ground plane via a substantially transmission-like connection. The substantially transmission-like connection includes a number of connection types including an interface trace on a printed circuit board. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention is operable to convert a driving source from a single ended signal to differential signals. By running signals in a differential mode, shared path effects are eliminated. Some of the benefits of this differential mode are reduced system noise, and improved transmission and detection of signals. Differential signals may be produced from conventional, non-differential devices. The ability to perform this transformation without isolating signals and without the use of a differential driver results in cost savings and accessibility among other benefits. The use of differential signals generated by the present invention offers many other benefits as well. The parasitic effects from connectors and integrated circuit (IC) packages often induce signal distortion that creates timing &ldquo;push out and cross talk problems. The use of differential signals, as generated by the present invention, will reduce these effects and improve overall system performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a system diagram illustrating an embodiment of a single to differential interface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> built in accordance with the present invention. A single ended source circuitry <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provides a single ended source output <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to a single to differential interface circuitry <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The single to differential interface circuitry <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> generates two differential signals from the single ended source output <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, namely, a differential output &num;1 <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and a differential output &num;2 <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. A differential receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives both of the differential output &num;1 <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the differential output &num;2 <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. A single output, a differential receiver circuitry output <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, is transmitted from the differential receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to any other device. The single to differential interface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be used to perform the transformation of a single ended signal to differential signals to be provided to any number of devices requiring differential inputs. </paragraph>

A single ended clock circuitry <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> provides a single ended clock output <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> to a single to differential clock interface circuitry <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The single to differential clock interface circuitry <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> generates two differential signals from the single ended source output <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, namely, a differential clock output &num;1 <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and a differential clock output &num;2 <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. A differential clock receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> receives both of the differential clock output &num;1 <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and the differential clock output &num;2 <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. A single output, a differential clock receiver circuitry output <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, is transmitted from the differential clock receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to any other device. The single to differential clock interface <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be used to perform the transformation of a single ended clock signal to differential clock signals to be provided to any number of devices requiring differential inputs. </paragraph>

A gain <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, biased using a floating DC source, is provided a signal from a source <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The output from the gain <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is fed to the transmit path of a transmission line <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> having a characteristic impedance Z<highlight><subscript>TL1</subscript></highlight>. In certain embodiments of the invention, the transmission line <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> is exemplary of any type of connection having a substantially transmission-like connection. As will be seen below in other embodiments of the invention, a substantially transmission-like connection is implemented in other forms included traces on a printed circuit board (PCB). The return path of the near end of the transmission line <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> is passed back to the floating low end voltage level of the DC source that biases the gain <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The transmit path of the far end of the transmission line <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> feeds a near end of a transmission line <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> having a characteristic impedance Z<highlight><subscript>TL2</subscript></highlight>. The return paths of both the near end and the far end of the transmission line <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> are grounded to the system ground of the single to differential interface via transmission lines <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The signal transmitted from the far end of the transmission line <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is passed to one of the inputs of a gain <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. For example, the transmit signal through the transmission line <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> passed to the negative input of the gain <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. This signal is referenced through a resistance R<highlight><subscript>LL </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> to a voltage level logic low V<highlight><subscript>LL</subscript></highlight>. The gain <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is biased using a voltage level V<highlight><subscript>DD </subscript></highlight>and is referenced to the system ground of the single to differential interface via transmission lines <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

For example, the signal fed back through the transmission line <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is from the positive input of the gain <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. This signal is referenced through a resistance R<highlight><subscript>LH </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight> to a voltage level logic high V<highlight><subscript>LH</subscript></highlight>. The transmit path from the near end of the transmission line <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> is passed to the return path of the far end of the transmission line <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>. The return paths of both the near end and the far end of the transmission line <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> are grounded to the system ground of the single to differential interface via transmission lines <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> There are certain areas within the single to differential interface via transmission lines <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> where the currents are all equal to a value &ldquo;I.&rdquo; For example, the current transmitted from the gain <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to the transmit path of the near end of the transmission line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and the current received from the receive path of the near end of the transmission line <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> are both equal to the value &ldquo;I.&rdquo; In addition, the values of the current transmitted through the resistance R<highlight><subscript>LL </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> to the voltage level logic low V<highlight><subscript>LL </subscript></highlight>and the current transmitted from the voltage level logic high V<highlight><subscript>LH </subscript></highlight>the resistance R<highlight><subscript>LH </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight> are also equal to the value &ldquo;I.&rdquo; These currents are of a common magnitude, or of a substantially similar magnitude. The design of the present invention, as shown in the embodiment of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, also ensures that there are no current return paths except through the various transmission lines. The particular values of the characteristic impedances of the transmission lines and the various resistors within the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are variable as required within various applications. One example of particular values that will provide the advantages contained within the present invention is shown below in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
