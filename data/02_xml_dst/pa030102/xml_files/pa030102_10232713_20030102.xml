<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electric rotating machine, in particular to the electric rotating machine, in which improvements are made on stator iron or steel sheets and on positioning of penetrating or through bolt holes thereof, in a small-sized electric rotating machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An electric motor is known as an electric apparatus for converting electric energy into mechanical energy. In the electric motor, in which an electric system and a mechanic system are combined, there are used a relative motion between magnetic field and conductors and the electromagnetic force caused between the magnetic field and current, and an attraction and a repulsion between those magnetism. As one sort of such the electric motors, there is known an electric rotating machine which performs a rotating movement, and is used a direct current (DC) motor, or an alternating current (AC) motor, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The electric rotating machine, such as an AC servo motor, etc., comprises, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> stator including a stator core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and stator coils <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a rotor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and end brackets <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, etc. The stator is constructed with the stator core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, which is formed through caulking of laminated layers of stator steel sheets, or through fixing of them by means of laser beam welding, etc., and in gutter portions of this stator core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are provided the stator coils <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The stator steel sheets are formed by punching a belt-like iron or steel sheet, for example, and it is common that the punching shape comprises a main body portion of functioning as a magnetic circuit and end portions, in a part of which are provided the through bolt holes for the purpose of fixing the stator onto the end brackets <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The rotor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has a rotating shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and is held between the end brackets <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> through shaft bearings <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The shaft bearing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is protected by a bearing protection cover <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. The end bracket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at a load side has the through bolt holes and outer attachment bolt holes, wherein the stator is fixed by means of the through bolt holes and through bolts, while being fixed to an outside portion by means of the outer attachment bolt holes and outer attachment bolts. And, the shapes of parts which constructs the electric rotating machine are designed to be in the rotational symmetry as far as possible, therefore a circle and/or a square are/is preferable. Also, an outer shape of a flange member gives an effect upon the size of the electric rotating machine, therefore it is so determined to be equal to around an outer shape of a container. Further, there is provided an encoder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for performing the detection of position and velocity of the rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the conventional electric rotating machine, the stator steel sheet has the through bolt holes provided or formed at every corner of the main body thereof, however they are shifted so that the through bolts and the outer attachment bolts do not overlap each other. For example, though the outer shape of the end bracket is nearly in the shape of a square, the stator steel sheets is formed into a nearly rectangular or oblong shape, and the through bolts are provided at the every four corners thereof. Also, it was done that, while forming cutting portions of the square shape at the every four corners of the stator steel sheets, the through bold holes are provided or formed in one side portion of the cutting portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, when forming the stator steel sheets in the rectangular or oblong shape, the rotational symmetry is broken, and therefore the magnetic property thereof is deteriorated. Also, when forming the cutting portions at the ever corners, since the side portion of the cutting portions where no such the through bolt hole is formed does not participate with nor contribute to the magnetic performance, an amount of use of the steel sheets comes up to be more than that being necessary, thereby causing a problem that the stator becomes heavy in the weight thereof. Also, there was caused a problem that the magnetic circuit is deteriorated in the symmetry thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An object, according to the present invention, for dissolving such the problems in the conventional arts, is to provide an electric rotating machine, with which can be maintained the rotational symmetry of the stator steel sheets, as well as the symmetry of the magnetic circuit, without increasing the weight of the stator. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, an embodiment(s) according to the present invention will be fully explained by referring to the attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of an electric rotating machine, according to the present invention, will be explained by referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The electric rotating machine according to the present invention comprises, as shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> stator including a stator core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and stator coils <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a rotor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, end brackets <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, etc. As is shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) which is the cross-section indicated by arrows A-A in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the stator is constructed by providing or inserting the stator coils <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> into the gutter portions <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which are formed on the stator core <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, being formed from the laminated layer of the stator iron or steel sheets <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> After forming ring members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and teeth members <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, respectively, by punching them from, for example, the belt-like iron or steel sheets, each of the stator steel sheets <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being constructed by inserting the teeth members <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into the gutter portions of the ring members <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. An example of the teeth member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The ring member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a main body portion, being in a circle shape around a rotation shaft of the rotor, at the outer periphery thereof, and corner portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, each being protruded partially for the purpose of provision of penetrating or through bolt hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Through the main body portion of the ring member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed the magnetic circuit, therefore, as shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it has a width that is almost constant in the radial direction all round the periphery thereof. And, each of the corner portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), has an area being at the lowest limit thereof, so that strength can be maintained in the vicinity of the through bolt hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Also, the corner portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are arranged in symmetric on both sides with respect to the lines B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> connecting between the through bolt holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the rotation shaft O of the rotor as the axes of symmetry. The rotor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has a rotation shaft <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and is held rotatably onto the brackets <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> through the shaft bearings <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The shaft bearing <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is held by a bearing holder cover <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> receiving the stator therein is molded so as to form the frame potion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> therewith, and is connected to the end bracket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which has a flange attachment portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The end bracket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at the load side comprises, as is shown in the FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a flange attachment portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having an outer attachment bolt hole <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a through bolt hole <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. And, each of the parts constructing the electric rotating machine is shaped in a circle or a square, so as to obtain the rotational symmetry as far as possible. However, the lines A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> indicate the axes of symmetry in the flange attachment portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the lines B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> indicate the axes of symmetry in the stator steel sheet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the point O indicates the rotation shaft or the axis of the rotational symmetry. However, since an outer shape of the flange attachment portion <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the end bracket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> gives an influence upon the size of the electric rotating machine, it is determined to be same to the outer shape of the frame. Further, it comprises an encoder <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for performing detection of position and velocity thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Explanation will be given on the end bracket of the electric rotating machine, according to the embodiment, by referring to the FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is an explanatory view of the end bracket seeing from the stator side, and the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is the explanatory view of that from the output shaft side thereof. The end bracket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has the outer attachment bolt hole <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the through bolt hole <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and an attachment hole <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for the shaft bearing holder cover. By means of the outer attachment bolts (not shown in the figures) which will be inserted into the outer attachment bolt holes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the electric rotating machine is attached or installed onto an outside. Also, by means of the through bolts <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be inserted into the through bolt holes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the stator which is received within the frame <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is attached onto the end brackets <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The outer shape of the end bracket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is about a square, and is in symmetrical upside down and on both sides with respect to the axes A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of symmetry. Each of the axes A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of symmetry defines an angle of 45&deg; in the mechanical angle with respect to the adjacent one thereof. And, the outer attachment bolt holes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are formed on the axes A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of symmetry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Further, the B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are the axes of symmetry in the stator iron or steel sheet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and explanation will be given on the stator steel sheet and the axes of symmetry in the embodiment, in more detail thereof. The ring member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the stator iron or steel sheet has, as shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, at least a corner portion(s) (a hatched portion) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the through bolt hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and it is symmetric upside down and on both sides with respect to the axes B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of symmetry, and is also in the rotational symmetry around the point O. Each of the axes B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of symmetry defines an angle of 45&deg; in the mechanical angle with respect to the adjacent one thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The outer attachment bolt holes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are formed on the axes A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of symmetry. And, the line connecting between the through bolt holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the point O (i.e., the axis B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is shifted from the line connecting between the outer attachment bolt holes <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the point O (i.e., the axis A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) by a predetermined angle (, for example, 10&deg;-20&deg;. If it is less than 10&deg;, the positions of the through bolt <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the outer attachment bolt hole <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> overlap each other, then there is a difficulty in the work of installing the electric rotating machine by use of the outer attachment bolts. Also, if it exceeds <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the position of the through bolt hole <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> protrudes outside from the outer shape of the bracket so that the size of the electric rotating machine comes to be large, therefore it is not preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In relation with the stator steel sheets used in the embodiment, though the explanation was given only on the example being consisted of two (2) kinds of the members, such as the ring member and the teeth member, however it may be consisted of only one (1) or alternatively of three (3) or more kinds thereof in stead thereof, and it is also possible to obtain the same effect as that mentioned above. Also, the explanation was given only on the example, where the stator steel sheet is in the shape of square and has the four (4) through bolt holes, however it may be in a shape other than that, but being in the rotational symmetry, or be in a figure other than that. And, with the symmetry and/or the sizes of the stator steel sheet, etc., they/it may shift or be shifted a little bit, by taking the manufacturing errors and accuracy into the consideration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As is fully explained in the above, in the electric rotating machine, according to the present invention, it is possible to restrict the portions which gives no contribution to the magnetic characteristics thereof only to the corner portions where are formed the through bolt holes, thereby maintaining the rotational symmetry of the stator iron or steel sheet but without increase of the weight of the stator. Namely, though in the conventional art are used the stator steel sheets having the sizes being about same to those of the outer shape of the frame, however according to the present embodiment, the outer shape of the frame and the outer shape of the stator are different from each other, so that the sizes of the stator steel sheets comes to be smaller, therefore it is possible to replace the portions, by which the stator steel sheet comes to be smaller, with a material having a light specific gravity, such as resin (2.0&times;103 Kg/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or so), thereby lightening the weight of the electric rotating machine greatly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is possible to obtain the electric rotating machine without increasing the weight of the stator, while maintaining the rotational symmetry of the stator steel sheets and the symmetry of the magnetic circuit thereof. </paragraph>
