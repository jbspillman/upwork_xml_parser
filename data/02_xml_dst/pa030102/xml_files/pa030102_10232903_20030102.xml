<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of a spacer used in an electron-beam apparatus such as an image-forming apparatus in which an electron beam is employed, and a manufacturing method of the electron-beam apparatus provided with the spacer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, as an image-forming apparatus in which electron-emitting devices are utilized, an evacuated plane type electron-beam display panel is known in which an electron source substrate having a number of cold-cathode electron-emitting devices thereon and an anode substrate having a transparent electrode and a phosphor thereon are confronted in parallel. Such an image-forming apparatus, in which field emission type electron-emitting devices are used, is disclosed in, for example, I. Brodie, &ldquo;Advanced technology: flat cold-cathode CRTs&rdquo;, Information Display, 1/89, 17 (1989). Further, such an image-forming apparatus, in which surface conduction electron-emitting devices are used, disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,883 and the like. A flat electron-beam display panel permits reduction in weight and the enlargement of a screen than a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display unit which is widely used at present, and can provide a higher luminance and a higher quality image than a flat display panel utilizing liquid crystals and other flat display panels such as a plasma display and an electroluminescent display. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a perspective view of a conventional flat electron-beam display panel which is partially cut out, as one example of the image-forming apparatus utilizing the electron-emitting devices. The configuration of the electron-beam display panel shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> will be detailed here. In this drawing, reference numeral <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> is a rear plate, numeral <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> is a face plate and <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight> is a side wall, and these members constitute a vacuum envelope. Further, numeral <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> is an electron source substrate and <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> is an electron-emitting device. In this example, one phosphor is disposed to one electron-emitting device. Moreover, numeral <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> (a scanning electrode) and <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> (a signal electrode) are wiring electrodes, and they are each connected to the electron-emitting device <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, numeral <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> is a metal back and <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> is a phosphor. Moreover, <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> is a spacer, which holds the electron source substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> and the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> at predetermined intervals and which is arranged in a vacuum envelope as a supporting member against atmospheric pressure. Besides, each junction of the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight>, the side wall <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight>, the rear plate <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> is sealed with a low melting point glass frit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to form an image on this electron-beam display panel, a predetermined voltage is successively applied to the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> and the signal electrode <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> arranged in a matrix state, whereby the predetermined electron-emitting device <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> positioned at the intersection of the matrix is selectively driven, and the phosphor <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> is irradiated with emitted electrons to obtain luminescent points at predetermined positions. Besides, for the purpose of obtaining the luminescent points of a higher luminance by accelerating the emitted electrons, a high voltage is applied to the metal back <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> so as to become a positive potential to the electron-emitting device <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>. Here, the applied voltage is within about several hundred volts to about several ten kilo volts, depending on the performance of the phosphor <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the distance d between the electron source substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> and the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> is usually set to about several hundred &mgr;m to about several mm so that vacuum dielectric breakdown (i.e., discharge) may not occur by this applied voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As the display area of this electron-beam display panel increases, the rear plate <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> need to be thickened to suppress the deformation of a plate substrate due to a difference between a vacuum in the vacuum envelope and an external atmospheric pressure. Thickening the plate substrate not only increases the weight of the display panel but also causes the distortion of the panel and the reduction of an viewable angle range when viewed from an oblique direction. Therefore, the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> is disposed, whereby a required strength of both the plates <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> can be relieved, which permits reduction in weight, decrease in cost and the enlargement of the screen. In consequence, the advantage of the flat electron-beam display panel can sufficiently be exerted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For a material which can be used for this spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, there are required (1) having a sufficient strength to atmospheric pressure (compressive strength), (2) having a heat resistance which can withstand heating steps in a manufacturing process and a high vacuum formation process, (3) matching to the substrate, the side wall and the like of the display panel in thermal expansion coefficients, (4) being a highly resistant member having insulating characteristics which can withstand the application of a high voltage, (5) a gas emission rate being low in order to maintain a high vacuum, and (6) being workable in a good dimension accuracy and being excellent in productivity. As such a material, a glass material is usually used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the display panel of the image-forming apparatus described above has the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> First, a part of electrons emitted from the vicinity of the spacer hit against the spacer, or ions produced by the function of the emitted electrons adhere to the spacer, whereby spacer charging might be caused. Further, the electrons which reach the face plate are partially reflected and scattered, and its part hit against the spacer, whereby the spacer charging might be caused. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have intensively investigated, and as a result, it has been found that when a rough state is formed on the surface of a spacer of an electron-beam apparatus provided with an electron source and the spacer in an airtight container, a practical coefficient of secondary electron emission can be more reduced than in a case where the surface of the spacer is smooth, so that the charging on the surface of the spacer can effectively be suppressed.

In addition, the formation step of the electroconductive film needs not to be provided separately, so that a step time consumed in the production of the spacer can be largely reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Besides, when the present invention described above comprises the step of heating and drawing the base material of the spacer having the rough state on its surface, or comprises both of the step of forming the rough state on the surface of the base material of the spacer and the step of heating and drawing the base material on which the rough state is formed, the following advantage is present. That is, even when an accuracy error exists in the rough state previously formed on the surface of the base material, the accuracy error can be remarkably reduced to a less serious extent by the subsequent heating and drawing, in addition to the noticeable reduction of the step time as described above. Therefore, the spacer base member having the desired rough state can be produced with a good reproducibility, and an accuracy margin can be largely taken during the formation of the rough state previously formed on the surface of the base material, so that yield can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the present invention described above comprises the heating and drawing step, a step of polishing the formed spacer base member can be eliminated, and the plurality of spacer base members can simultaneously be processed by one heating step, so that the effect of mass production can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is desirable that the coarseness of the rough state on the surface of the spacer base member should be set to 0.1 &mgr;m or more to 100 &mgr;m or less, because the continuity of an electroconductive film formed on the surface is good and the effect of field convergence caused by a steep shape in the protruded portion can also be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is desirable that sheet resistance on the surface of the spacer arranged in the electron-beam apparatus should range from 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;/&square; in view of charging prevention and power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Embodiment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A desirable embodiment of the present invention will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> First, the first embodiment will be described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> (1) A base material <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of the spacer having the similar shape of the cross section of a spacer base member to be produced is used. At this time, when the cross section of the desired spacer substrate is s1 and the cross section of the spacer base material is s2, s1 and s2 satisfy s1/s2&lt;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> (2) Both ends of the spacer base material <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> are secured and a part of the longitudinal direction is heated by a heater <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> at a temperature exceeding a softening point. One end is fed in the direction of the heating portion at a speed V2 by a feeding roller <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the other end is drawn in the same direction at a speed v1 by a drawing roller <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. At this time, these speeds v1 and v2 satisfy s1v1&equals;s2v2. Further, the heating temperature depends on the type and processing shape of the base material <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, and shall usually exceed 500 degrees C. Thereupon, the rough state is formed on the surface of a drawing roller <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, and along with heating and drawing, the rough state is sequentially formed on the surface of the drawn base material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> (3) An enlarged base material after it has been cooled is cut at a desired length by a blade <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> to produce a spacer base member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As described above, if the desired rough state is formed on the surface of the base material in the step in which the base material of a spacer is heated and drawn, the formation of the rough state can use the heat during the heating and drawing time, and moreover, the molding step of a spacer base member from the base material and the formation step of the rough state into the molded spacer base member need not to be provided separately and a great reduction in the step time consumed in the production of the spacer is enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> (4) Then, an electroconductive film is formed on the surface of the spacer base member produced as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> This electroconductive film is a high-resistive film or low-resistive film described later, and either is formed using the sputtering method, vacuum evaporation method, printing method, aerosol method, or dipping method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Next, the second embodiment will be described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> (1) A base material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of a spacer having the similar shape as the cross section of a spacer base member to be produced is used. Besides, the rough state are previously formed on the surface of the base material of this spacer. Further, when the cross section of a desired spacer base member is s1 and the cross section of the base material of a spacer is s2, s1 and s2 satisfy s1/s2&lt;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> (2) Both ends of the spacer base material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> are secured and a part of the longitudinal direction is heated by the heater <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to a temperature exceeding a softening point. One end is fed in the direction of the heating portion at the speed v2 by the same feeding roller as the first embodiment described previously which is not shown and the other end is drawn at the speed v1 by a drawing roller <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> toward the same direction as v2. At this time, these speeds v1 and v2 satisfy s1v1&equals;s2v2. Further, the heating temperature depends on the type and processing shape of a base, and shall usually exceed 500 degrees C. Along with heating and drawing, the desired rough state is formed on the surface of a drawn base material <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> (3) An enlarged base material after it has been cooled is cut at a desired length by the same blade as the first embodiment described previously which is not shown to produce a spacer base member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As described above, if a spacer base material having the rough state on its surface is previously heated and drawn and the rough state is formed on the surface of the spacer base material as the rough state of desired shapes during such heating and drawing step, even when there is an accuracy error in the rough state previously formed on the surface of the base, the accuracy error is greatly reduced to a problem-free extent by subsequent heating and drawing in addition to the great reduction of the same step time as above. Therefore, the spacer base member having the desired rough state can be produced with good reproduction, and an accuracy margin is obtained on a large scale during the formation of the rough state previously formed on the surface of the base material and yield is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> (4) Next, the electroconductive film described in the first embodiment described previously is formed on the surface base member produced as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Further, the formation of aforementioned electroconductive film may also be performed during the heating and drawing step of aforementioned spacer base material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> by depositing means (<highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>) installed between the heater <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and the drawing roller <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in the step of aforementioned (2). Besides, the depositing means shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a depositing means of a high-resistive film described later and consists of a spray head portion <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> which coats the drawn spacer base material <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> with the liquid containing the forming material of a high-resistive film and a controller <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> of the spray head <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As described above, if the desired rough state and an electroconductive film are formed on the surface of a base material in the step in which the base material of the spacer is heated and drawn, the formation of the rough state can use the heat during the heating and drawing time, and moreover, the formation step of the electroconductive film needs not to be provided separately and a great reduction in the step time consumed in the production of the spacer is enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> are schematic views showing an example of the spacer obtained according to the embodiment described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is the schematic view of the cross section which runs in parallel to the vertical direction <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> is the schematic view of the cross section which runs in parallel to the horizontal direction <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a spacer base member in which the desired rough state are formed at least on its surface and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a high-resistive film which is formed on the surface of the spacer base member and whose purpose is the prevention of charging. The high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> forms the rough state on the final surface in conformity with the rough state on the surface of the spacer base member. <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a low-resistive film provided to obtain an ohmic contact between the electrode and spacer of an electron-beam apparatus, as requested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Further, an outline of the structure of a plane type display unit (electron-beam apparatus) which uses a rough base member with the aforementioned high-resistive film in the spacer is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (the details are described later). The display unit has the structure in which a substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> on which a plurality of cold-cathode devices <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> are formed and a transparent face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> on which a phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> which is a luminescent material are opposed via a spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, wherein the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> has a rough state on its surface and is coated with a high-resistive film which is formed at a coating thickness not more than the average amplitude value of their rough state and whose purpose is the prevention of charging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> (Function of the Rough State: Dependency of Secondary Electron Emission Charging on Incident Angle) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The following effects can be obtained from the rough state formed on the surface of the spacer manufactured according to the embodiment described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The first effect decreases the incident angle of an incident electron in the high incident angle mode which greatly contributes to an amount of charging. Due to the effect of a design of this shape, a decrease effect of the incident angle increment component of a coefficient of secondary electron emission can be suppressed to a level of less than one third against a smooth surface. This effect is especially effective to a direct incident electron whose high incident angle exceeds 80 degrees from the most adjacent electron-emitting device in particular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Further, as the second effect, an effect of confining a secondary electron is obtained like the accumulation body of a fine Faraday cup if the deep rough state are formed as one form of the rough state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as the third effect, a suppression effect of a multiple-emission secondary electron is listed. The emitted secondary electron receives energy from the acceleration electric field and advances a trajectory in the anode direction, being accelerated. Because the energy immediately after it has been emitted is comparatively low, it is pulled in a local charging area, reenters a spacer and generates positive charge. At this time, by applying surface roughening to a smooth substrate, range distance can be divided, and the effect of suppressing the accumulation of the positive charge can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As the fourth effect, the effect of suppressing an incident angle against an anode radiation electron is listed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The flying path of an incident electron into a spacer is diversely distributed. In particular, in the re-incidence of a reflection electron from a face plate (hereinafter referred to as an FP reflection electron), because its emission direction is distributed almost concentrically, the reflection electron is distributed in many surrounding directions. As a result of examining the dependence of spacer charging per device on the spacer, the distance between electron-emitting devices and an applied anode voltage by these inventors, it is proved that the radiation electron from an anode substrate is the emission voltage from the third and fourth adjacent electron devices as well as from the most adjacent electron device. The aforementioned range distance is overemphasized per display unit and the degree of the effect is not uniform. In general, for the purpose of obtaining high luminance, the effect is multiplied and becomes one cause of charging due to the installation of members such as aluminum electrodes installed for increasing the utilization efficiency of luminescence from a phosphor and the high voltage of an acceleration voltage. This phenomenon means that the FP reflection electron depends on the distance from the spacer and a closer device has a large amount of re-incidence. It also means that the incident angle during the re-incidence into a far incident point is multiplied as the FP reflection from a luminescent point is done from the distance position nearer to the spacer. For such reason, the rough state formed in many directions function effectively as the suppression effect of the secondary electron emission for the reflection electron in the oblique mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> This is the main function regarding the charging suppression of a surface-roughened, i.e. a rough surface in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Further, as another effect, because the function of producing a rough state is separated from that of producing an antistatic film, the effect of simply enabling the control of a surface shape from a place inside the surface is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> (Periodicity of the Rough State) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> For the arrangement of the rough state of a spacer in the embodiment described above, to obtain the effect of the secondary electron emission suppression described previously, a periodic arrangement needs not always to be obtained and may also be a random periodic arrangement. What an arrangement structure is to be obtained may be decided from the convenience of the production step, for example. In particular, in case of the periodical arrangement, it is desirable that the rough state comprising a plurality of periodic structures should be formed as the repetitive cycle considering the energy distribution and incident angle distribution of secondary electrons and reflection electrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> (Pitch and Amplitude of the Rough State) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> From the viewpoint of the relaxation effect of the dependence of a secondary electron emission coefficient on an incident angle, the intervals and amplitude of the rough state are not affected greatly and may be selected arbitrarily. It is desirable that the rough state should depend on an acceleration voltage and have an interval or pitch of about 100 &mgr;m considering the effect that a multiple emission secondary electron is trapped before it obtains energy from the electric field between anode and cathode gaps and the acceleration energy of the positive charging area. Further desirably, it is desirable that they should have an interval of less than 10 &mgr;m. Moreover, for the same reason, as the amplitude value of a rough state, an arbitrary value can be selected from the viewpoint of the suppression of the dependence of a secondary electron on the incident angle. It is desirable that the surface roughness (Ra) should be a high value exceeding 0.05 &mgr;m in that the suppression effect of the multiple emission secondary electron is obtained. To suppress the continuity of a film formed on a surface and the effect of the electric field convergence caused by a steep shape in the protruded portion, it is desirable that the average roughness of less than 100 &mgr;m should be obtained as the upper bound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> (High-Resistive Film) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> If an insulating material such as glass is used as the material of a spacer base member, it is desirable that a high-resistive film having an antistatic function should be provided on the surface to improve the antistatic function. This high-resistive film shall produce the rough state on the surface in conformity with the rough state of a lower layer, and various films can fundamentally be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> To form a high-resistive film having high leveling properties of a rough state, fundamentally, it is important that the high-resistive film is not formed at a considerably larger coating thickness than the desired amplitude value of the lower layer or the substrate rough state, and desirably it is formed at a coating thickness below the amplitude value of the lower layer. However, if the high-resistive film is exceedingly made thin, the sheet resistance is increased, and the continuation of the film is easy to lose in the area where the curvature of the rough state is large (a tight bend). Therefore, if desired conductivity cannot be applied to a spacer, it is desirable that the coating thickness should be at least 10 nm or more and desirably 50 nm or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As the production method of a high-resistive film, the existing antistatic film production process can be applied. For example, the sputtering method, vacuum evaporation method, printing method, aerosol method or dipping method can be applied. From the viewpoint of a low-cost production process, the liquid-phase process such as the dipping method is desirable. At this time, it is important to control the coating thickness and the viscosity of a coating liquid to a low value to decrease the leveling properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is desirable that the secondary electron emission coefficient of a high-resistive film should be lower, and it is more desirable that the secondary electron emission coefficient of a smooth film should be below 3.5. Moreover, from the viewpoint of the chemical stability of a film, it is desirable that the surface layer should be in a higher oxidation state than the inside of the film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Further, in the display unit described previously, the one side of the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to the wiring of the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> on which a cold-cathode device is formed. Furthermore, its opposite side is electrically connected to the acceleration electrode (metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight>) for making the electron emitted from the cold-cathode device collide with a luminescent material (phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight>) by high energy. That is, the current in which an acceleration voltage is almost divided by the value of resistance of an antistatic film is applied to the antistatic film formed on the surface of the spacer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Thereupon, the value of resistance Rs of the spacer is set to the desired range due to the prevention of charging and power consumption. It is desirable that the surface resistance R/&square; should be below 10<highlight><superscript>13 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;/&square; from the viewpoint of the prevention of charging. To obtain a sufficiently antistatic effect, it is further desirable that the surface resistance should be below 10<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;/&square;. The lower bound of the sheet resistance depends on the spacer shape and the voltage applied between the spacers, and it is desirable that the lower bound of the sheet resistance should be 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;/&square; or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> It is desirable that the thickness t of a high-resistive film should range from 10 nm to 1 &mgr;m. The thickness of the high-resisting film also differs depending on the surface energy of a material and its adhesion to a substrate or a substrate temperature. In general, a thin film of less than 10 nm is formed in an islands structure, its resistance is unstable and the thin film is lack of reproduction. On the other hand, if the coating thickness t exceeds 1 &mgr;m, because the film stress increases, the danger of film peeling increases and the depositing time is prolonged, the productivity is bad. Accordingly, it is desirable that the coating thickness should be 50 to 500 nm. The sheet resistance R/&square; is &rgr;/t, and it is desirable that the resistivity &rgr; of the high-resistive film should be 0.1 to 10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;cm from the desirable range of R/&square; and t described above. Further, to realize more desirable ranges of the surface resistance and the coating thickness, it is desirable that &rgr; should be set to 10<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;cm. A spacer raises its temperature when a current applies to the high-resistive film formed on the spacer or when the whole display outputs heat during operation. If the resistance temperature coefficient of the high-resistive film is a high, negative value, when the temperature rises, the value of resistance decreases and the current applied to the spacer increases, thereby further causing the temperature rise. Then, the current continues being increasing until the limit of a power supply is exceeded. The value of the resistance temperature coefficient in which a runaway of such current occurs is empirically a negative value and the absolute value exceeds 1%/&deg; C. That is, it is desirable that the resistance temperature coefficient of the high-resistive film should be higher than &minus;1%/&deg; C. (when the value is negative, the absolute value should be less than 1%/&deg; C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As materials having high-resistive film characteristics, metal oxides are excellent. Among the metal oxides, chromium, nickel and copper oxides are desirable materials. This is because it is assumed these oxides are comparatively small in the secondary electron emission efficient and are difficult to charge even when the electron emitted from an electron-emitting device touches a spacer. Except the metal oxides, carbon is a desirable material because the secondary electron emission coefficient is small. In particular, because amorphous carbon is high in resistance, the spacer resistance can easily be controlled to a desired value. However, because the aforementioned metal oxides or carbon is hard to adjust the value of resistance to the range of the resistivity which is desirable as a high-resistive film and is easy to change the resistance according to an atmosphere, only these materials are lack of the controllability of the resistance. Aluminum and transition metal alloy nitrides can control the value of resistance over the wide range from a good conductor to an insulator by adjusting the composition of transition metal. Further, in the step of producing a display unit described later, these materials are stable materials whose change in the value of resistance is small. Moreover, because the resistance temperature coefficient is higher than &minus;1%/&deg; C., these materials are practically easy to use. Ti, Cr and Ta are listed as transition metal elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The high-resistive film provided on the surface of a spacer may also be a film in which an oxide metal film or carbon film of the top coat layer is laminated on the surface of an aluminum transition alloy nitride film (hereinafter referred to as an alloy nitride film). The value of resistance of the whole high-resistive film is chiefly defined according to the value of resistance of the alloy nitride film and the top coat layer has the effect of suppressing the prevention of charging. Because the top coat layer allows the value of resistance to be controlled by an atmosphere as described previously, the thickness of the top coat layer should be decided so that the value of resistance of the top coat layer can exceed half the value of resistance of the high-resistive film. If the resistivity of the top coat layer is high, because the electric charge accumulated on the surface becomes difficult to quickly set free, a value not exceeding 20 nm at which the thickness of the top coat layer is restricted is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> An alloy nitride film is formed on a spacer substrate by a filming formation means such as the sputtering, reactive sputtering, electron beam evaporation, ion plating or ion assist evaporation method under a nitrogen gas atmosphere. Although a metal oxide film can also be produced by the same film formation method, oxygen gas is used instead of nitrogen gas in this case. In addition, the metal oxide film can be produced even by the CVD method and the alkoxide coating method. A carbon film is produced by the evaporation method, sputtering method, CVD method or the plasma CVD method. In particular, to produce amorphous carbon, hydrogen is contained in an atmosphere during depositing or hydrocarbon gas is used as depositing gas. The alloy nitride film and the top coat layer may also be produced by another device, and the adhesion of the top coat layer by successively laminating them. Although the antistatic film of this embodiment is described against the prevention of spacer charging of a plane type display unit, it can be used as a high-resistive film in another application without being restricted to this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Further, the distribution of a horizontally charged electric charge can be suppressed by allowing the spacer provided on the high-resistive film to have a low-resistive film in the contact portion with the top and bottom substrates. Furthermore, it is desirable that the value of resistance of the low-resistive film should be below one tenth the value of resistance of the high-resistive film and below 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>(&OHgr;/&square;) as the area resistance for the purpose of improving the electrical junction with the top and bottom substrates. Moreover, the electron-emitting device is a cold-cathode device, and that the electron-emitting device having the electroconductive film including an electron-emitting region between electrodes. Besides, it is more desirable because the structure of the device is simple and high luminance can be obtained by allowing the electron-emitting device to have a surface conduction electron-emitting device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as an image-forming apparatus which forms an image by irradiating the target with the electron emitted from the electron-emitting device according to an input signal, the electron-beam device to which this proposal applies can be adapted. As the target, a latent image can be formed using various materials from the viewpoint of image recording, moving pictures (video) can economically be recorded and displayed by making the target consist of a phosphor. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Next, the configuration and manufacturing method of the display panel of an image-forming apparatus to which the spacer manufactured according to the aforementioned embodiment are described showing a specific example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a perspective diagram of the display panel used as this example, and the diagram is shown in which a part of the panel is omitted to show the internal structure. </paragraph>

To assemble the airtight container, it needs to be sealed so that the junction of each member can hold sufficient strength and airtightness. For example, sealing is achieved by coating the junction with frit glass and baking it ten minutes or more at 400 to 500 degrees C. under an atmosphere or nitrogen atmosphere. The method of evacuating the inside of the airtight container will be described later. Further, because the inside of the airtight container is held under the vacuum of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>(Pa), the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> is provided as an atmospheric-pressure-proof body for the purpose of preventing the damage of the airtight container caused by atmosphere pressure or a sudden shock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> A substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> is secured to the rear plate <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>, and N&times;M pieces of cold-cathode devices <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> are formed on the substrate. (N and M are positive integers exceeding 2 and are properly set according to the targeted number of display elements. For example, in a display unit whose purpose is the display of a high definition television set, it is desirable that numbers exceeding N&equals;3,000 and M&equals;1,000 should be set.) The N&times;M pieces of cold-cathode devices are wired in a simple matrix shape by M lines of row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> and N lines of column-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>. The portion configured with <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> described previously is called a multiple electron beam source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> If the multiple electron beam source used in an image-forming apparatus is an electron source in which a cold-cathode device is wired in a simple matrix shape, there are no restrictions in the material and shape or manufacturing method of the cold-cathode device. Accordingly, for example, a surface conduction electron-emitting device and an FE type or an MIM type cold-cathode device can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Next, reference will be made to the structure of a multiple electron beam source in which a surface conduction electron-emitting device (described later) is arranged on a substrate as a cold-cathode device and is wired in a simple matrix shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A plane view of the multiple electron beam source used in the display panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The surface conduction electron-emitting devices <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> are arranged on the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> and these devices are wired in a simple matrix shape by the row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> and the column-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>. An insulating layer (not shown) is formed between electrodes in the intersection of the row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> and the column-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>, thereby holding electrical insulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The cross section which runs in parallel to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Besides, after the row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight>, the column-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>, an inter-electrode insulating layer (not shown) and the device electrode and electroconductive film of a surface conduction electron-emitting device have previously been formed on a substrate, the multiple electron source having such structure is manufactured by feeding power to each device via the row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> and the column-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> and performing energization forming operation (described later) and energization activation operation (described later). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> This example has the structure in which the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> of a multiple electron beam source is secured to the rear plate <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> of an airtight container. If the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> of the multiple electron beam source has sufficient strength, the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> itself of the multiple electron beam source may also be used as the rear plate of the airtight container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Further, the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> is formed at the bottom of the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight>. Because this example is a color display unit, the portion of the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> is separately coated with a phosphor consisting of the three primary colors of red, green and blue used in the field of a CRT. The phosphor of each color is separately applied in a stripe shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, for example, and a black conductor <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is provided between the stripes of the phosphor. The purpose of providing the black conductor <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is to prevent a shift from occurring a display color even if there is a slight shift at the irradiation position of an electron beam, to prevent the lowering of a display contrast by preventing the reflection of external light and to prevent the charge-up of the phosphor screen caused by the electron beam. The black conductor <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> uses graphite as the main component, but other materials may also be used if the aforementioned purposes are satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the method of separately applying a phosphor of three primary colors is not restricted to the arrangement in a stripe shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> described previously, and for example, it may also be the delta-shaped arrangement as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> or other arrangements (for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Besides, to produce a monochromatic display panel, a single-color phosphor material may be used as the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight>, and a black conductive material needs not always to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Further, a known metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> is provided on the surface of the rear plate side of the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> in the field of a CRT. The purpose of providing the metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> is to improve the utilization factor of light by reflecting a part of the light radiated by the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> on a mirror finished surface, to protect the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> from the collision of a negative ion, to operate the metal-backed phosphor screen as an electrode for applying an electron beam acceleration voltage and to operate it as the conductive path of an electron which excites the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight>. After the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> has been formed on the face plate substrate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight>, the metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> is formed using the method of smoothening the surface of the phosphor screen and vacuum-evaporating Al on it. Besides, if a phosphor material for low voltage is used in the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight>, the metal-backed phosphor screen is not used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, although a transparent electrode is not used in this example, for example, the transparent electrode which uses ITO as a material may also be provided between the face plate substrate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> and the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> for the purpose of applying an acceleration voltage and improving the conductivity of the phosphor screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a schematic view of the cross section <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and the number of each portion corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> consists of members in which, on the spacer base material substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whose purpose is the prevention of charging is deposited, and then a low-resisting film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is deposited on a joint surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the spacer facing the inside (metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> or the like) of the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> and the surface (row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> or column-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>) of the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> and its adjoining side portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Further, to attain the aforementioned purpose, only the required number of spacers is arranged at necessary intervals and the spacers are secured to the inside of the face plate and the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> with a jointing material <highlight><bold>1041</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the high-resistive film is deposited on the surface exposed under the vacuum of at least an airtight container in the surfaces of the spacer base material substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and is electrically connected to the inside (metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> or the like) of the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> and the surface (row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> or column-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>) of the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> via the low-resistive film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> and the jointing material <highlight><bold>1041</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment described here, the shape of the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> is made a thin plate shape. It is arranged in parallel to the row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> and is electrically connected to the column-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight>. A reference numeral <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> denotes an inter-electrode insulating film for insulating a column-directional wiring (not shown in the drawing) from a row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> needs to have such insulation as can resist to the high voltage applied between the row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> and the column-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> and the metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> on the inside of the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight>, and have such conductivity as prevents the charging into the surface of the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As the spacer base member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, for example, ceramic members are listed such as quartz glass, the glass in which the content of impurities like Na is reduced, soda lime glass and alumina. Besides, it is desirable that the space base member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> should have a thermal expansion coefficient approximate to that of a member consisting of an airtight container and the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The low-resistive film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprising the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> is provided to electrically connect the high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> (metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> or the like) on the side of high potential and the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> (wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> or the like) on the side of low potential, and the name of an intermediate electrode layer (intermediate layer) is also used below. The intermediate electrode layer (intermediate layer) can have a plurality of functions listed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> (1) The high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As described already, the high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided for the purpose of preventing the charging on the surface of the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. If the high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is directly connected to the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> (metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> or the like) and the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> (wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> or the like) or via the jointing material <highlight><bold>1041</bold></highlight>, a high contact resistance occurs on the interface of the junction and the electric charge generated on the surface of the spacer may not be able to be removed quickly. To avoid this, a low-resistive intermediate layer is provided on the jointing surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> which touches the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight>, the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> and the jointing material <highlight><bold>1041</bold></highlight> or the side portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> near by the jointing surface together with the jointing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> (2) The potential distribution of the high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is made uniform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The electron emitted from the cold-cathode device <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> forms an electron trajectory in accordance with the potential distribution formed between the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight>. To prevent turbulence from occurring in the electron trajectory in the vicinity of the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, the potential distribution of the high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> needs to be controlled over all areas. If the high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is directly connected to the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> (metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> or the like) and the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> (wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> or the like) or via the jointing material <highlight><bold>1041</bold></highlight>, nonuniformity of a connected state is generated due to the contact resistance of the interface of the connecting portion, and the potential distribution of the high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be shifted from a desired value. To avoid this, a low-resistive layer is provided over the full length area of the spacer end (contact surface <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or side portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) in which the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> joins with the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight>, and the potential of the whole high-resistive film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be controlled by applying a desired voltage to this intermediate layer portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> (3) The trajectory of an emitted electron is controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The electron emitted from the cold-cathode device <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> forms an electron trajectory in accordance with the potential distribution formed between the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight>. Regarding the electron emitted from the cold-cathode device in the vicinity of a spacer, the restrictions (changes in wiring and device positions) caused by installation of the spacer may occur. In such case, to form an image without distortion and nonuniformity, the desired position on the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> needs to be irradiated with an electron by controlling the trajectory of the emitted electron. By providing a low-resistive intermediate layer in the side portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the surface which joins with the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight>, the potential distribution in the vicinity of the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> is characterized by desired characteristics and the trajectory of the emitted electron can be controlled. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Further, to evacuate the inside of an airtight container, after the airtight container has been assembled, an exhaust pipe and a vacuum pump which are not shown are connected and the inside of the airtight container is evacuated to the degree of vacuum of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>(Pa). Subsequently, the exhaust pipe is sealed. To maintain the degree of vacuum of the airtight container, a getter film (not shown) is formed at the predetermined position of the airtight container immediately before or after it has been sealed. The getter film is a film formed by heating and evaporating a getter material whose main component is Ba, for example, by a heater or high-frequency heating, and the inside of the airtight container is maintained in the degree of vacuum of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>(Pa) by the adsorption operation of the getter film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In the image-forming apparatus which uses a display panel described above, if a voltage is applied to each of the cold-cathode devices <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> via the ex-container terminal Dx<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Dxm, Dy<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or Dyn, an electron is emitted from each of the cold-cathode devices <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, a high voltage of several hundreds of volts or several kilo volts is applied to the metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> and the emitted electron described above is accelerated and then is made collide against the inside of the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight>. Consequently, each of color phosphors which forms the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> is excited and emitted, thereby displaying an image. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In this example, a spacer is obtained as follows. The details will be described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The glass basic material having S2&equals;18 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(9 mm&times;2 mm) is fed at a speed of v2&equals;1 mm/min using a roller <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> as a spacer base material <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and is softened at about 700 degrees C. by a heater <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The glass basic material is drawn by a drawing roller <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> arranged in the vicinity of the heater so as to obtain v1&equals;50 mm/min and is cut by a blade <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> so that the length can be set to 40 mm. Thereupon, the rough surfaces are formed on the surface of the drawing roller <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> with a sand paper of &num;4000, and such a consistent process as forms the rough state on the surface of a glass base member and obtains a spacer base material at the same time when the glass base material is heated and drawn is used. Next, a Cr&mdash;Al alloy nitride film is formed in a coating thickness of 200 nm by simultaneously sputtering Cr and Al targets on the surface in which the rough state is formed on its surface as shown above by a high-frequency power supply as an antistatic, high-resistive film. Sputter gas is mixed gas whose Ar to N2 is 1 to 2, and the total pressure is 0.1 Pa. The sheet resistance of a film deposited simultaneously under the conditions described above is R/&square;&equals;2&times;10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;/&square;. In addition to this, the present invention can use various antistatic films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Further, a low-resistive film is formed in the area which becomes the junction of the upper and lower electrodes. Both a Ti film of 10 nm thick and a Pt film of 200 nm thick are vapor-phase-formed as a beltlike shape of 200 &mgr;m in the area which becomes the connecting portion by sputtering. At this time, the Ti film is required as a backing layer which reinforces the coating adhesion of the Pt film. Thus, a spacer with a low-resistive film is obtained. The coating thickness of the low-resistive film is 210 nm and the sheet resistance is 10 &OHgr;/&square;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The rough state is formed on the surface of the obtained spacer, and both the covering and continuity of the film in the rough state formation portion are good. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The display panel shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> described previously is produced using the spacer obtained in this manner.

Besides, to perform the sealing described previously, because each color phosphor <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and each device arranged on the substrate <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> must be made to correspond to each other, the rear plate <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>, the face plate <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> and the spacer <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> are fully aligned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> After the inside of the airtight container completed in the manner described above has been evacuated by a vacuum pump via an exhaust pipe (not shown) and has arrived at a sufficient degree of vacuum, a multiple electron beam source is manufactured by feeding power to each device through the ex-container terminals Dx<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dxm and Dy<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dyn via the row-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> and the column-directional wiring <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> and performing energization forming operation and energization activation operation. Then, an exhaust pipe not shown is heated by a gas burner at the degree of vacuum of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Pa to melt it and perform the sealing of an envelope (airtight container). Finally, the getter operation is performed to maintain the degree of vacuum after sealing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In the image-forming apparatus which uses such display panel as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, completed in this manner, an electron is emitted by applying a scan signal and a modulation signal to each cold-cathode device (surface conduction electron-emitting device) <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> by a signal generating means not shown through the ex-container terminals Dx<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dxm and Dy<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dyn respectively, an emitted electron beam is accelerated by applying a high voltage to the metal-backed phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> through the high-voltage terminal Hv and an image is displayed by making the electron collide with the phosphor screen <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> and exciting and radiating each of the color phosphors <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Besides, the applied voltage Va to the high-voltage terminal Hv is applied to a limit voltage in which discharge slowly occurs within the range of 3 to 12 kV, and the applied voltage Vf between wiring <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> and the wiring <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> is 14V. If continuous driving is enabled one hour or more by applying a voltage exceeding 8 kV to the high-voltage terminal Hv, withstand voltage is judged to be good. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> For the image-forming apparatus produced in this example, the withstand voltage is judged to be good in the vicinity of a spacer. Further, including a luminescent spot caused by the emission electron from the cold-cathode device <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> which is located near the spacer, luminescent spot columns are two-dimensionally formed at equal intervals and a clear color image can be displayed with good color reproduction. This indicates that such turbulence of an electric field as affects an electron trajectory is not generated if the spacer is installed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram for describing this example, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a schematic diagram of the formation method of a spacer base member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, 161</cross-reference> is a glass basic material which is the base material of a spacer and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is a heated, drawn and pulled base. <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is a heating device and s2 is the cross section of the base material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. Further, s1 is the cross section of the base material <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, V2 is the feed speed of a basic material and V1 is a spacer pulling speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The cross section S2 of the base material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is formed in the similar figure as the spacer cross section S1 to be formed. In this example, the spacer cross-sectional size to be formed shall be set to 1.8 mm&times;0.2 mm, and the 50-times size is set for the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Further, The base material glass uses PD200 (made by Asahi Glass) and the temperature of a furnace is about 760 degrees C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The ratio of a similar figure, temperature, the base material feed speed V2 and the base material pulling speed V1 depend on the type and processing shape of a glass material, but they can be applied if the ratio of the similar shape is several times to several hundreds of times and the temperature is a temperature exceeding the softening point of the glass basic material. The temperature range used usually is 500 to 800 degrees C. Further, the feed speed of the base material needs to be at least lower than the pulling speed of the base, but the optimum conditions are decided arbitrarily. In this example, V2 is set to 1 m/min and V1 is set to 50 m/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Besides, in this example, the base material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> uses a base material on which a groove is previously formed using a mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> By this manufacturing method, a desired groove can also be formed on the surface of the spacer base member, too. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The same result as Example 1 is obtained as performance, too, by incorporating such obtained spacer in an image display panel in the same manner as Example 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Further, like this example, if a rough groove is formed on the spacer base material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, this is desirable because a highly fine, the desired rough groove is formed on the base material portion <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> pulled by heating and drawing. Moreover, even if a slight error occurs in the rough groove of the base material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, the error is canceled to a problem-free extent for the rough groove of the pulled base material portion <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the accuracy margin when the rough groove is formed on the base material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is obtained on a large scale and the effect of yield improvement is obtained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, 161</cross-reference> is a glass base material and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is a glass material pulled out in a spacer shape. <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is a heating device and <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is a spray head portion. <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> is a spray controller and <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is a transfer roller. <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> is a coating liquid for transfer and <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> is a pulling roller. Further, S2 is the cross section of the basic material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and S1 is the cross section of the spacer <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. V2 is the feed speed of a basic material and V1 is a spacer pulling speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The cross section S2 of the glass basic material and the spacer cross section S1 are formed in a similar figure. In this example, the cross-sectional size of a spacer to be formed is set to 1.6 mm&times;0.2 mm and the 12-times size is set to the basic material. Furthermore, the glass uses PD200 (made by Asahi Glass) and the temperature of a furnace is about 720 degrees C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In this example, V2 is set to 0.5 m/min and V1 is set to 6 m/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Next, the formation method of a high-resistive film will be described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is an illustration of a part of <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In the diagram, <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is a spray head and <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is a coating solution supply line and <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> is a gas supply line. <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is a coating solution fogged by a spray and <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> shows a formed high-resistive film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In this example, a coating liquid is used in which carboxylic salt of silicon and stannous oxide is dissolved in an octane solvent at a mixed mole fraction of 2 to 1 of a metal in the carboxylic concentration of 10 mol/litter as the raw material of the high-resistive film. The coating liquid is applied to both surfaces of the spacer <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> using the nitrogen gas controlled by the spray controller <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, by the spray head <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. In this example, the direction of gravity almost matches the pulling direction and the spray head <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> performs spraying against the coating surface of the spacer <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> by being tilted to about 40 degrees. Besides, in this example, the surface temperature of the spacer of the high-resistive film formation portion is 400 degrees C. when it is measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Besides, if materials whose coating is enabled and which indicate values of resistivity of 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;cm are used as the raw materials of a high-resisting film, various materials can be applied as single and composite materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Next, the formation method of a spacer electrode will be described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, 191</cross-reference> is a blade for coating the surface of a transfer roller <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> with a coating liquid for transfer <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is a part of the coating liquid for transfer <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> is a spacer electrode portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In this example, silver paste is used in the coating liquid <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. Further, the transfer roller uses a transfer roller in which a line-shaped groove at a pitch of 10 &mgr;m and a depth of 4 &mgr;m is formed in the perpendicular direction against space. Besides, the pitch of the groove and the size of the transfer roller and rotational speed can properly be selected for arbitrary values according to the viscosity of the transfer coating liquid, the characteristics of particles, coating thickness and the pulling speed V2 of a spacer substrate. Besides, in this example, the spacer surface temperature of the high-resistive film formation portion of the spacer electrode <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> is 360 degrees C. when it is measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Further, if materials whose coating is enabled and which indicate values of resistivity of less than 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;cm are used as spacer electrode materials, various materials can properly be selected and applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In this example, when the formed spacer is cut at a predetermined length and is applied to an image-forming apparatus in the same manner as Example 1, high-quality image formation with few color shifts is realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Like this example, the utilization efficiency of heat can be improved by using the heat when a substrate is formed for the formation of a high-resistive film and a spacer electrode. Further, the reduction of tact time is performed through a continuous process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Further, in this example, the formation of the high-resistive film and the spacer electrode is performed using the heat when the substrate is formed, but heat can also be used for only drying. For example, in such case where the high-resistive film is formed by applying the liquid in which oxide particles are dispersed, the case frequently occurs where the crystal growth of oxide is required to obtain the function. In such case, after only drying has been performed through a continuous process, the high-resistive film can be formed by separately baking it. Also in this case, the drying process is continuously performed, the efficiency of quantity production can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in this example, a high-resistive film is formed in one layer. If it is formed in a multiple layer, spray coating can be performed matching the number of lamination layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Besides, in this example, the base material <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> uses a base material on which a groove is previously formed by cutting or machining. By this manufacturing method, a groove can also be formed on the surface of the spacer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Further, the formation sequence of the high-resistive film and the spacer electrode can be reversed. Besides, the same result as Example 1 is obtained as performance, too, by incorporating such obtained spacer in an image display panel in the same manner as Example 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> (Effects of the Invention) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention can provide a method of manufacturing a spacer having the surface structure which can suppress surface charging through a simple process and at a low price. Further, a spacer without product variations can be produced at low cost. Furthermore, the spacer whose charging is suppressed can be provided by depositing a proper high-resistive film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Moreover, an electron-beam apparatus such as an excellent image-forming apparatus of excellent display quality whose displacement of a luminescent point and surface discharge caused by charging can be provided. </paragraph>
