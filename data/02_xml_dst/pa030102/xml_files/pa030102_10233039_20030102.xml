<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of forming a transistor for a semiconductor device from a semiconductor wafer comprises forming a first nitride layer over the front and back of the wafer, and forming a second nitride layer over the front and back of the wafer and over the first nitride layer. A first resist layer is formed over the front of the wafer and at least a portion of the second nitride layer over the front of the wafer is exposed. The first and second nitride layers are removed from the back of the wafer while, simultaneously, at least a portion of the exposed portion of the second nitride layer over the front of the wafer is removed. Next, a second layer of resist is formed leaving at least a portion of the first nitride layer exposed. Finally, the exposed portion of the first nitride layer is etched. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to the field of semiconductor manufacture, and more specifically to a method for forming a contact. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> During the formation of a semiconductor device, contacts, for example to the substrate or word line, are commonly formed. FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> describe a method for simultaneously forming a portion of a transistor, contacts to a word line and a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> semiconductor wafer substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a front and a back is layered with various materials. For example, a gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a polycrystalline silicon (poly) layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a tungsten silicide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an oxide separation layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are formed on the front of the wafer, then a nitride layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B is formed over the entire wafer, including both the front (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A) and the back (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B), for example by thermally growing the layer. Some of the other materials (for example the gate oxide <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and poly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) may also be formed on the back of the wafer and removed by other processing steps. A patterned photoresist (resist) layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed over the nitride layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the front of the wafer. The layers are etched using the resist layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as a mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Next, a layer of spacer material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, for example oxide or nitride, is formed over the front and back of the wafer to result in the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A spacer etch can be performed at this point to form the spacers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, or the spacer etch can be formed after the back side nitride etch described later. The front of the wafer is protected, for example with a mask (not shown), and the material on the back of the wafer is removed, for example with a wet or, preferably, a dry etch. The material on the back of the wafer is removed to reduce the stress on the wafer caused by the properties of the nitride film. Wafer processing continues, for example to form a first layer of borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a layer of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a second layer of BPSG <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A resist layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is patterned over the wafer, leaving exposed the areas of the wafer to which contacts are to be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An etch is performed in an attempt to result in the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows a structure in which a contact <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is made to the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is made to the layer of tungsten silicide <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The layers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> show a stack which forms a portion of a transistor (a word line stack). In a conventional process, stopping the etch at the substrate and at (or within) the layer of tungsten silicide (or some other layer) is difficult using a single etch, for example because the nitride etches slower than the BPSG. Typically, to achieve the tungsten silicide contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> a portion of the substrate will be removed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, which can produce an electrically undesirable cell. If the etch is stopped at the substrate, often contact will not be made to the tungsten silicide <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> but the contact will instead stop within the oxide <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or nitride <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One method of solving this problem is to mask and etch the contact to the substrate, then mask and etch the contact to the tungsten silicide. This, however, adds an extra mask step which can create problems with alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A process which forms a contact to the substrate and to another layer without adding an additional mask step is desirable. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the inventive process is described by FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, for example to form a transistor for a semiconductor device. The structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, or a similar structure, is formed according to means known in the art and a layer of resist is formed to result in the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Thus <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> includes a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having a front and a back. A layer of material <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>B, such as nitride layer is formed over the front (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A) and back (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>B) of the wafer, such as by formation as a thermally grown layer. Other layers may be formed over the front and back of the wafer as well, such as a gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a poly layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a tungsten silicide layer, a dielectric <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and a spacer material <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>B, for example of nitride or oxide, as shown. A first layer of resist <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is formed over the front of the wafer, and at least a portion of the layer of material <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A over the front of the wafer is exposed. It should be noted that layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A is exposed insofar as at least a portion of it is not covered by the resist <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, but it may be covered by other layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>B is removed from the back of the wafer, for example using a wet etch or, preferably a dry etch, and simultaneously (i.e. during the same etch), at least a portion of the exposed portion of layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A is removed from the front of the wafer. It may not be necessary to completely remove the exposed portion of layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A during this etch, but only a portion of the exposed portion may be removed. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, only a portion of the exposed portion of layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A has been removed. However, the entire exposed portion of layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A could possibly be removed during the etch to the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> spacer layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A such as oxide or nitride, or other layers, may be formed over layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A prior to the formation of the resist layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. As shown, this spacer layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is formed over the front and back of the wafer, and over layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. If used, this layer is etched after its formation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> using the resist layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as a mask. Additionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, other layers such as BPSG and TEOS can be formed over the front of the wafer subsequent to the etch step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> If a spacer layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A is formed, the exposed portion as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> can be completely removed, or only a portion of it may be removed. It all of the exposed portion of layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A is removed, a portion of <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A may also be removed, and layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A may be further etched by a subsequent spacer etch. If only a portion of layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A is removed, any remaining portion of the exposed portion of layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A is removed after the removal of resist <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a subsequent spacer etch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> After an etch of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> structure, wafer processing can continue to the point as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. For example, a spacer etch can be performed after the removal of layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and other layers such as a first BPSG layer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, a TEOS layer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and a second BPSG layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be formed over the front of the wafer subsequent to the etch step. Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a second layer of resist <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> formed subsequent to the etch of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> structure. The resist layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as shown leaves exposed any remaining portion of the exposed portion of layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A. After forming the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> structure, an etch removes the exposed portion of layer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to expose the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. If any exposed portion of layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A remains, layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A is further etched during this step to result in a contact similar contact <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Etching continues until the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is exposed to form a contact to the substrate similar to element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, and until contact is made to the tungsten silicide layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to result in a structure similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Subsequently, a conductive layer can be formed to contact the substrate and the tungsten silicide. As can be seen from the Figures, layers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can form a portion of a word line stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The invention as described is advantageous for example (referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) as it adds only one mask <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and one development step to the current process. The contact mask is formed in an existing resist layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which is used to protect the front side of the wafer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It may be preferable to leave a portion of layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A after the etch of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> structure to provide word line protection during subsequent implant steps. The removal of any portion of layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A during the etch of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is preferable as it reduces the nitride, the full thickness of which is responsible for the underetched contact to the silicide in conventional processes. Any remaining portion of the exposed portion of layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A will be removed during the etch of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described with reference to illustrative embodiments, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the illustrative embodiments, as well as additional embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to this description. For example, the layers shown are illustrative, and various other layers are possible and likely. Structures other than contacts to a word line stack and the substrate would likely be improved with the inventive process as described. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will cover any such modifications or embodiments as fall within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
