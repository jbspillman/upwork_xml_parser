<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention is directed to a programmable IC (integrated circuit) arrangement. Included are: at least one input/output terminal; at least two receiver/source terminals for selectable electrical connection to the at least one input/output terminal; and a plurality of layers electrically interconnected with one another and providing electrical connection between the at least one input/output terminal and at least one of the at least two receiver/source terminals. At least a sub-plurality of the plurality of layers includes electrically conductive components selectably providable at at least two positions so as to selectably program electrical connection between the at least one input/output terminal and the at least two receiver/source terminals. The selectably providable electrically conductive components include ones of selectably providable vias, switch-contacts and well regions. The plurality of layers can include any of differing types of layers selected from the group of semiconductor well, diffusion, polysilicon, contact, metal conductor and vias layers. In a disclosed example embodiment, the programmable IC arrangement is a ROM (read-only-memory) cell having two input/output terminals, and where the electrically conductive components selectably program electrical connection between the two input/output terminals and two receiver/source terminals. Portions of the plurality of layers which include the electrically conductive components are substantially stacked substantially in alignment with each other. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to compact, stacked layer configurations for integrated circuits, which allow programmability on each layer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Although a ROM (read-only-memory) cell and a version number associated with an IC (integrated circuit) will be used to describe examples of both the background and the invention, practice of the present invention is not limited to the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Turning first to a background, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a portion of an integrated circuit IC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Often ICs include groups of ROM cells which are pre-programmed during IC design, with such preprogramming propagating through manufacturing, to provide desired values or code. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, ICl has an example plurality of ROM cells C<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, . . . , having outputs O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, . . . , respectively. Each ROM cell may have a selectably programable physical arrangement which can be arranged during IC design and/or manufacturer, so as to program the ROM cell to output a desired value. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example cross-section of an example ROM cell C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such ROM cell is typically formed of a plurality of layers, for example, the ROM cell C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. may have layers L<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, L<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, L<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, L<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, and some of the layers may be electrically interconnected with other layers using vias layers V. The layers L<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, L<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, L<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, L<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>may be any of a plurality of different types, for example, semiconductor well, diffusion, polysilicon, contacts, metal conductor, vias, etc. constructions, with such layers being resultant from a plurality of different masks (and other processes) applied during IC manufacturing. One of such layers may have the above-discussed selectably programmable portion P, i.e., so as to be selectably programmable during IC design and/or manufacture so as to configure or program the ROM cell according to at least two possible choices, e.g., to output a logical &ldquo;1&rdquo; or logical &ldquo;0&rdquo;, a first voltage level Vcc or a second voltage level Vss, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As one example of a use of groups of ROM cells on an IC, often times after IC manufacturing, numerous different versions, generations or lots (hereinafter, &ldquo;versions&rdquo;) of an IC chip will be design modified (e.g., improved) and/or modified during manufacturing in a strive to remove paracitics and/or unwanted behavior and/or improve performance, e.g., often by changing a layout of one or more masks which were used to pattern the IC from one version to another. During subsequent analysis/comparison of the differing version IC chips, often it becomes important to be able to determine to which version a particular IC chip belongs. Accordingly, in order to meet such need, the outputs O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, . . . , of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> example plurality of ROM cells C<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, . . . , respectively, could be programmed (i.e., constructed) during design and/or manufacture to output a version number of the IC, e.g., to output a binary value of &ldquo;0001&rdquo; for a first version IC, a binary value of &ldquo;0010&rdquo; for a second version IC, etc. If desired, such outputs from the ROM cells could then be accessed during analysis/comparison to determine to which version a particular chip belongs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In addition, several differing groups of ROM cells could be used to separately provide differing information, for example, a first group of ROM cells could be used to provide a unique serial number for the IC chip, a second group could be used to identify the exact masks used for a first type of layer (e.g., metal layer), a third group could be used to identify the exact masks used for a second type of layer, another group could be used to identify a date or manufacturing plant of manufacture. Such information could then be used for IC chip identification purposes, or for verification purposes, e.g., to check to see if the proper sets of masks were used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Discussion turns next to disadvantages with the FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> arrangement. More particularly, a first disadvantage with the FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> arrangement is that such ROM cells are not programmable at each layer. More particularly, assume that after analysis of a first version IC, it is determined that a configuration of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> layer L<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>should be changed in order to remove a paracitics and/or unwanted behavior and/or improve performance. Accordingly, a mask used to produce this layer L<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>may be changed. Since any IC manufactured with this changed mask would represent a new version IC, the version number programmed within the ROM cells C<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, . . . , should also be changed. However, since the programmable portions P of the ROM cells are not within the layer L<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>and instead are within layer L<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, a mask for the programmable layer L must also be changed in order to change the IC version number. The required change of two masks instead of just one is a disadvantage in terms of increased manufacturing complexity, costs and increased time-to-market (TtM) delays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As a second disadvantage, a size of the programmable portion P may be larger than other arrangements within the ROM cell and may increase a size of each ROM cell, such that the ROM cells C<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, . . . , have substantial wasted die space W (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) therebetween. Wasted die space is incompatible with present day trends toward increased miniaturization and lowered IC costs, and therefore is disadvantageous. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Before beginning a detailed description of the subject invention, mention of the following is in order. When appropriate, like reference numerals and characters may be used to designate identical, corresponding or similar components in differing figure drawings. Further, in the detailed description to follow, example sizes/values/ranges may be given, although the present invention is not limited to the same. As a final note, well known power/ground connections, insulation layers and other components may not be shown within the FIGS. for simplicity of illustration and discussion, and so as not to obscure the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As a prelude to more detailed description of the invention, an overview of the invention is appropriate. More particularly, embodiments of the invention are directed to a multi-layered electrical configuration where an output can be modified by modifying any one of its constituent layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Turning now to detailed description of an example embodiment of the invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a portion of an example advantageous integrated circuit IC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which includes an example advantageous group of ROM cells C<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&prime;, C<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>&prime;, C<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>&prime;, C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>&prime;, C<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>&prime;, . . . according to one example embodiment of the present invention. Relatedly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an example plan view of one example advantageous ROM cell C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&prime; of the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Such example ROM cell C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&prime; may be rectangular in shape and sized at 13 microns by 7 microns (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), but practice of the present invention is not limited thereto. In fact, other regular and even complex shapes may be used, and as photolithography and other IC manufacturing techniques mature over time, it is expected that ROM cells of much smaller size could be manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The example ROM cell C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&prime; may further have a cell inter-connector arrangement I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>which allows two differing voltage levels or signals (e.g., voltages Vcc and Vss) to traverse such cell and interconnect with a similar cell inter-connector arrangement of a neighboring cell, i.e., such that the two differing voltages or signals can be made to commonly extend across a plurality of ROM cells, and such differing voltages or signals are available within a perimeter of each ROM cell. Such inter-connectors I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>may also be considered to be receiver/source terminals. Each ROM cell also has two inputs/output terminals O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&prime; which, as will become apparent in the discussions to follow, may each be programably connected to either cell inter-connector I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. It should be apparent and understood by those skilled in the art that the input, output, receiver and source functions of the terminals O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&prime; and inter-connectors I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are interchangeable, i.e., the terminals O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&prime; could just as equally serve as receiver/source terminals, and the inter-connectors I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>could just as equally serve as input/output terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a plurality of plan views more clearly showing example layers and/or components of the example advantageous ROM cell of the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. More particularly, shown are differing plan views <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. The plan view <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> more specifically may contain: n-diffusion components N-DIFF shown in an upper portion of plan view <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and commonly shaded with a first type of shading; n-well components N-WELL shown commonly outlined with dashed lines; and, polysilicon components POLY shown in a lower portion and commonly shaded with another type of shading. The plan views <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> show example differing metal layers METAL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively, the plan view <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> shows an example generic layer GLAYER, and the plan view <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> shows the example metal inter-connect layer IMETAL. Further shown throughout the plan view <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> are numerous vias represented by small darkened squares, such vias being made of some type of electrically conductive material (e.g., metal) extending between and being for the purpose of interconnecting overlying non-vias layers. Ones of the N-DIFF, N-WELL, POLY, METAL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, GLAYER, IMETAL and vias components may be provided by differing masks (and other processes) during IC manufacture, and ones of such components may separately exist or co-exist on different layers of the ROM cell. For sake of clarity and brevity, not illustrated are insulation layers between the above-described layers, as insulation layers are well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An advantageous arrangement of the present invention is that all of the example N-DIFF, N-WELL, POLY, METAL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, GLAYER, IMETAL and vias V arrangements each contain selectably programmable components such that the example ROM cell is fully programmable at any level or layer. In beginning to discuss such programmable arrangements, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> will be used for discussion of selectably programmable vias components. More particularly, using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>&apos;s plan view <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as an example, shown are a pair of vias V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>&prime; which are selectably moveable (i.e., providable) between two positions, i.e., selectable movability being indicated by the hopping arrows in plan view <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, with each end of the hopping arrows indicating possible selectable positions. More specifically, using a simple change in a mask which is used to form the vias V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>&prime;, such vias can be moved to (i.e., provided at) the second indicated positions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As will become apparent in discussion presented shortly ahead, such move of vias results in a reversal of connections between the two inter-connectors I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the two inputs/output terminals O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&prime;, i.e., if inter-connectors I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are connected to inputs/output terminals O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&prime;, respectively, while vias V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>&prime; are in a first position, then inter-connectors I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>will be connected to inputs/output terminals O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&prime;, O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, respectively, when vias V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>&prime; are in the second position. Accordingly, such selectably programmable components render the example ROM cell fully programmable at this V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>&prime; level or layer. Similar discussion apply with respect to each of the other vias pair V<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>&prime;, V<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>&prime;, V<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>&prime;, V<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>&prime;, and V<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>&prime; levels, shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> plan views <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, respectively, and hence redundant discussion is omitted for sake of brevity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A further advantageous arrangement of the present invention, is that all of the N-DIFF, N-WELL, POLY, METAL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, METAL<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, GLAYER, IMETAL and vias V components/layer may be stacked and substantially aligned in a vertical column for compactness, and thus the example ROM cells C<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&prime;, C<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>&prime;, C<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>&prime;, C<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>&prime;, C<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>&prime;, . . . can be more tightly packed with one another as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, i</cross-reference>.e., the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> wasted space W is avoided.

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Discussion will now turn to the selectable programmability of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A, 17B</cross-reference> arrangement. Within <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the substitute SUB may be electrically connected to a voltage V<highlight><subscript>ss</subscript></highlight>, whereas a metal conductor M-IN may be connected to a voltage V<highlight><subscript>cc </subscript></highlight>or any predetermined signal. By sliding a well region (shown in dashed form), appropriate voltage or signals can be connected to desired terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> More particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference> shows a first arrangement wherein the WELL is formed in a rightward position, so as to contact the n-diffusion regions N-DIFF<highlight><subscript>IN</subscript></highlight>, N-DIFF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the p-diffusion region P-DIFF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, enclosed within such well. If the WELL is diffused with n-type material, a conduction path CP<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>will be set up through the contacts and n-diffusion regions of the N-DIFF<highlight><subscript>IN</subscript></highlight>, n-WELL and N-DIFF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>so as to allow electrical conduction between the metal conductors M-IN and M-OUT<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Discussion next turns to a left half of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference>. More particularly, if the substrate SUB is generally a p-type material, a conduction path CP<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>will be set up through the contacts and p-diffusion region P-DIFF<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, so as to allow electrical conduction between the substrate SUB and M-OUT<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, if the substrate SUB is connected to a voltage (e.g., Vss), M-OUT<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>would be connected to such voltage. In contrast, a diode-type arrangement is set up with respect to the n-diffusion region N-DIFF<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and the substrate SUB, in a manner to prevent electrical conduction therebetween. Accordingly, the substrate voltage V<highlight><subscript>ss </subscript></highlight>is output at M-OUT<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, whereas the M-IN voltage V<highlight><subscript>cc </subscript></highlight>or signal is output at M-OUT<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>

More particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference> shows a second arrangement wherein the WELL is formed in a leftward position, so as to contact the n-diffusion regions N-DIFF<highlight><subscript>IN</subscript></highlight>, N-DIFF<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and the p-diffusion region P-DIFF<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, enclosed within such well. If the WELL is diffused with n-type material, a conduction path CP<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>will be set up through the contacts and n-diffusion regions of the N-DIFF<highlight><subscript>IN</subscript></highlight>, n-WELL and N-DIFF<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>so as to allow electrical conduction between the metal conductors M-IN and M-OUT<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. In contrast, a diode-type arrangement is set up with respect to the p-diffusion region P-DIFF<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and the n-WELL, in a manner to prevent electrical conduction therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With regard to the right half of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>B, if the substrate SUB is generally a p-type material, a conduction path CP<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>will be set up through the contacts and p-diffusion region P-DIFF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, so as to allow electrical conduction between the substrate SUB and M-OUT<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, if the substrate SUB is connected to a voltage (e.g., Vss), M-OUT<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>would be connected to such voltage. In contrast, a diode-type arrangement is set up with respect to the n-diffusion region N-DIFF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the substrate SUB, in a manner to prevent electrical conduction therebetween. Accordingly, the substrate voltage V<highlight><subscript>ss </subscript></highlight>is now output at M-OUT<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, whereas the M-IN voltage V<highlight><subscript>cc </subscript></highlight>or signal is now output at M-OUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As should now be understood with respect to the present invention, there are many types of switching arrangement which could be used. For example, the foregoing example embodiments described vias switching arrangements (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>for example) which have two via structures which are slid in parallel between two possible positions and which represents an inter-layer switching arrangement. Further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>for example, describe metal slide switching arrangements where two metal connecting pads are slid in parallel between two possible positions and which represents an intra-layer switching arrangements. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>for example, describe metal jumping switching arrangements where two metal conducting pads are jumped in opposition between two possible positions, and which also represents an intra-layer switching arrangement. Further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>for example, describe N-well jumping switching arrangements where two N-well conducting pads are jumped in opposition between two possible positions, and again which represents an intra-layer switching arrangement. Still further, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>for example, describe a sliding well which is slid between two possible positions and which also represents an intra-layer switching arrangements. Practice of the present invention is not limited to those examples, and in fact, other types of switching arrangements would equally apply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Further, it should be apparent that the present invention could also be practice with semiconductor arrangements having a substrate and diffusions which are of the opposite types to those given in the above example embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> This concludes the description of the example embodiments. Although the present invention has been described with reference to a number of illustrative embodiments thereof, it should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art that will fall within the spirit and scope of the principles of this invention. More particularly, reasonable variations and modifications are possible in the component parts and/or arrangements of the subject combination arrangement within the scope of the foregoing disclosure, the drawings and the appended claims without departing from the spirit of the invention. In addition to variations and modifications in the component parts and/or arrangements, alternative uses will also be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> For example, practice of the all-layers-programmable arrangement of the invention is not limited to use with a ROM cell, but instead, could be used for many other uses, with a non-exhaustive listing of other uses including: an all-layers-programmable routing structure, for routing signals through a plurality of layers; an all-layers-programmable wiring structure; etc. Further, practice of the invention is not limited only to providing IC version numbers, but instead, could be used for many other uses, with a non-exhaustive listing of other uses including: providing register values and/or programming code for use upon IC initialization; providing an IC serial number; providing information regarding a manufacturing date/time, manufacturer, manufacturing plant, authorized uses of the IC; etc. In addition, although the example embodiment discussed includes two input/output terminals O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&prime;, O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, practice of the invention is not limited to the same, i.e., practice of the invention could be made with only a singular input/output terminal, or could be made with more than two input/output terminals. Likewise, although the example embodiment discussed includes only two receiver/source terminals, practice of the invention is not limited to the same, i.e., there could be three or more receiver/source terminals. As another alternative, although the example embodiment describes each singular input/output terminal being programmably connected to only a singular receiver/source terminal, practice of the present invention is not limited to the same. For example, if any of the vias or switch-contacts are provided at both selectable positions (instead of just one position) within any of the programmable layers, then both interconnectors I<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>would be mutually connected to inputs/outputs O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&prime;, O<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>. In addition, each all-layers-programmable arrangement of the present invention may further include an activating/deactivating arrangement such as a switching transistor (e.g., within an electrical conduction path of such arrangement), for turn on/off an operation of such arrangement.</paragraph>
