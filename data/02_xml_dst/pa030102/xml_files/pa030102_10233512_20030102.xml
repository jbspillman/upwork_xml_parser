<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to X-ray spectrometry, and specifically to methods and devices to detect and analyze X-ray microfluorescence. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> X-ray microfluorescence analysis is a non-destructive technique known in the art for determining the atomic composition and thickness of thin films. Typically, a focused X-ray beam is directed at a sample, and the X-ray fluorescence induced by the interaction of the X-rays with the sample is detected by a detector located near the sample. The composition and thickness of the irradiated sample are determined from the intensity and energy of the fluorescent X-ray photons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In &ldquo;Annular-Type Solid State Detector for a Scanning X-Ray Analytical Microscope,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Review of Scientific Instruments </italic></highlight>66(9) (September, 1995), pp. 4544-4546, which is incorporated herein by reference, Shimomura and Nakazawa describe an annular germanium detector located near an irradiated sample which transduces the energy resulting from X-ray fluorescence into a single channel of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,937,026, to Satoh, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a microfluorescent X-ray analyzer in which a capillary tube is used to deliver X-ray excitation to a small region of a sample. The capillary passes through a hole in the center of a flat plate solid-state X-ray detector, which is used to detect fluorescent X-rays emitted by the sample. The geometry of the capillary tube and the detector allows fluorescent X-rays from a small excitation region to be detected over a large solid angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,256,431, to Fraser, U.S. Pat. No. 3,581,087, to Brinkerhoff and U.S. Pat. No. 5,778,039, to Hossain, whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference, describe systems for detection and analysis of X-ray fluorescence using multiple detectors. In all of these patents, a sample is excited by an X-ray source, and the multiple detectors are used to detect the X-ray fluorescence in different, respective energy domains. Typically, the energy domains are chosen to correspond to emission bands of different elements in the sample, so that comparative measurements can be made of the relative concentrations of two elements, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,497,008, to Kumakhov, which is incorporated herein by reference, describes analytic instruments using a polycapillary X-ray optic, also known as a Kumakhov lens, for X-ray fluorescence analysis or spectroscopy. The instruments described use a single fluorescence detector. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of some aspects of the present invention to provide improved apparatus and methods for X-ray microfluorescence analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of some aspects of the present invention to provide apparatus and methods for detection and analysis of X-ray microfluorescence associated with very small geometrical features of a sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is yet a further object of some aspects of the present invention to provide apparatus and methods for detection of faults occurring in production of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the present invention, an X-ray microfluorescence analyzer comprises an X-ray source which irradiates a small spot on a sample, and a plurality of individual detectors arrayed around the spot, so as to capture X-ray photons emitted from the sample responsive to the X-ray illumination. Preferably, the detectors are arrayed in a generally symmetrical pattern about the spot. A processing unit receives signals from the detectors and processes them to compare the intensity of photon emission captured by the different detectors, and thus to detect variations in the intensity as a function of azimuth about the irradiation beam. These variations are indicative of directional inhomogeneity of the emission from the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The detected azimuthal differences in the intensity of emission in a selected energy range are preferably used to determine properties of microscopic structures in the sample under test. Alternatively or additionally, the differences are monitored in order to accurately align the X-ray source and detectors with such structures. The method of the present invention, wherein multiple detectors are used simultaneously to measure emission in a common energy range at different azimuths, is substantively different from methods of X-ray fluorescence analysis known in the art. Such methods, as described in the Background of the Invention, are generally based on detection at only a single azimuth at any given time. When multiple detectors are used, their purpose is to measure emission in different, respective energy ranges, and directional inhomogeneity of emission is not considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the analyzer is used to measure overlay errors between successive layers, such as metallization layers, created on a semiconductor wafer in the course of integrated circuit production. Preferably, a test zone is created on the wafer, in which a pattern in a lower layer, using a first element,is overlaid by a substantially identical pattern in an upper layer, using a second, different element. The first and second elements are typically metal elements, although other types of X-ray detectable elements may also be used. When the layers are in proper registration, the pattern in the upper layer substantially shields the element in the lower layer from X-rays and prevents X-ray photons from the first element from reaching the detectors. When there is a registration error, however, a portion of the pattern in the lower layer is exposed to X-rays, so that photons from the first element can reach the detectors. The processing unit analyzes the intensity and direction of emission of these X-ray photons in order to determine the degree and direction of misregistration between the upper and lower layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In other preferred embodiments of the present invention, the analyzer is used to determine the composition and thickness of bumps formed on a surface of the sample. Such bumps typically comprise metal bumps, which are formed on the upper surface of a semiconductor wafer, for example, and are then used as contact points between an integrated circuit made from the wafer and a suitable chip carrier (in place of wire bonding) . The analyzer of the present invention is used to measure the size and thickness of these bumps, in order to verify that they will provide a suitable connection to the chip carrier. To perform the measurement accurately, however, it is necessary that the small spot that is excited by the X-ray source be accurately aligned with one of the bumps. Preferably, directional inhomogeneity of X-ray emission from the bumps is measured so as to provide an indication of misalignment between the spot and the bump, and thus to drive a translation stage so that the spot and the bump are precisely aligned. Alternatively or additionally, the processing unit averages the signals from the different detectors to compensate for any residual misalignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In still other preferred embodiments of the present invention, the sample comprises a crystalline substance, such as single-crystal silicon, which generates a diffraction pattern when irradiated by the X-ray source. The diffraction pattern has directional inhomogeneity, whose direction is determined by an orientation angle of the substance. This diffraction pattern can cause anomalies in measurement of X-ray fluorescence by the analyzer. The processing unit detects the inhomogeneous diffraction pattern by detecting differences in the signals that it receives from the different detectors. Most preferably, the signal differences are used to drive a rotation stage so as to align the sample, relative to the detectors, in a manner that minimizes the impact of the diffraction on the fluorescence measurement. Alternatively, the signal differences may be used to determine the crystal orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> There is therefore provided, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method of X-ray analysis, including: </paragraph>

Preferably, the method includes introducing a relative rotation between the sample and an array of detectors, responsive to the determined angle, so that the X-rays are diffracted in a desired direction relative to the detectors. Alternatively or additionally, detecting the X-rays further includes detecting fluorescent X-rays emitted by the sample, and comparing the intensities includes using the determined angle to distinguish between the diffracted X-rays and the fluorescent X-rays.

Preferably, detecting the X-rays includes detecting X-rays emitted by the sample at a plurality of different azimuthal angles relative to a beam axis of the irradiating X-rays, and assessing the portion of the lower feature that is not covered includes comparing the intensity of the X-rays emitted at the different angles to determine a direction of misregistration of the upper feature with the lower feature. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Fluorescent X-rays, emitted by sample <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in response to the irradiating X-rays, are produced within spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and are collected by a plurality of detectors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> arrayed around the spot. (For clarity of illustration, only detectors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. All of the detectors appear in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.) The arrangement and operation of the detectors are described in more detail hereinbelow. Signals from the detectors are transferred to a processing unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which most preferably comprises a plurality of pulse processors, with a separate input and processing channel for each of the detectors. Each channel determines the spectral intensity of emission captured by the respective detector, preferably using methods of energy-dispersive processing, as are known in the art. An output stage of processing unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> analyzes sums and differences of the signals from the different detectors in order to measure the spectral intensity of X-ray emission from the sample and azimuthal variations in the intensity. These measurements are used determine the local structure and composition of sample <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, as described hereinbelow. The resultant information is then output to a display <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Preferably sample <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is scanned by a translation/rotation stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, as is known in the art, under the control of processing unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is used to align spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the array of detectors with features of interest in the sample and to allow different areas of the sample to be tested. Alternatively the X-ray tube, optics and detectors are together scanned over the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic top view of spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed on sample <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and of detectors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> positioned around the spot, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Preferably, the detectors comprise four PIN diodes, such as type S1223 PIN diodes produced by Hamamatsu Photonics, K. K., of Hamamatsu City, Japan. The detectors are arranged symmetrically about spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and are preferably positioned as close as is practically possible to the spot. Thus, in the present embodiment, in which each of the detectors has an active collection area in the form of a square of side 2.5 mm, the detectors are arranged in a square having sides of approximately 9 mm and at a distance of approximately 4 mm from the surface of sample <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the detectors are angled towards spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, in order to increase the active area presented to the spot. It will be appreciated that the number and type of detectors and their dimensions and positions are described herein by way of example, and other numbers, sizes, positions and types of detectors may similarly be used. For example, another analyzer of this general type is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/114,789, which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent application, and whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> During irradiation by source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> generates fluorescent X-ray photons which are incident on the detectors, wherein corresponding pulses are in turn generated in the detectors and conveyed to processing unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The processing unit analyzes and counts the pulses from the plurality of detectors. Most preferably, spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and detectors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are maintained substantially stationary in relation to sample <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> until sufficient counts have been recorded by unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in one or more spectral regions of interest for a satisfactory measurement to be made. Processing unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> then moves sample <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> using stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to a new spot to be analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When sample <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises a crystalline substance, such as a semiconductor wafer, X-rays incident at spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are diffracted in a characteristic diffraction pattern. This pattern is illustrated schematically by a shaded pattern <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on sample <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Some of the diffracted X-rays reach the detectors and can cause saturation of the detectors or pulse pile-up in unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, or can otherwise confuse measurements of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) by the detectors. Such interference by diffracted radiation in XRF measurements is known in the art. The accepted solution is to rotate the sample until, by trial and error, the effect of diffracted radiation on the XRF measurement is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a superior solution to this problem that is made possible by the present invention. Processing unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> measures the azimuthal inhomogeneity of the X-ray signals that are received from spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, preferably by comparing a sum of the signals from detectors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to a sum of the signals from detectors <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. In the orientation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in which pattern <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> falls along a diagonal of the square defined by the detectors, the two sums will be approximately identical. The interference of the diffracted radiation with the XRF measurement will be minimized in this orientation. Thus, to cancel the effect of the diffraction, unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> preferably rotates stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> until the sums are equalized. Alternatively or additionally, the initial difference between the sum of the signals from detectors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and that from detectors <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is computed by the processing unit and is then used to calculate an optimal angle to which stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> should be rotated in order to minimize the diffraction effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram that schematically illustrates a system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for processing of semiconductor wafers using analyzer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this system, differential XRF analysis is used to verify that microscopic features formed on the wafer have the proper shape, composition and mutual registration. Analyzer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably integrated on-line with the processing of the wafer, so that as successive layers are formed on the wafer, each new layer can be tested and verified in turn. System <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is shown here by way of example, and integration of analyzer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into other types of processing systems will be clear to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> For each layer to be formed on the wafer, a microlithographic stepper <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> forms a mask pattern on photoresist that is deposited on the wafer surface, as is known in the art. The photoresist is developed and etched by an etcher <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and a metal layer is filled into channels created by the etching, in a metallization chamber <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the order of the steps may be reversed, so that the metal layer is applied to the entire wafer surface, followed by patterning and etching of the metal. In either case, analyzer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> measures differential XRF signals generated by the metal elements in the metal layers, as described hereinbelow. Alternatively, XRF signals due to non-metal elements may be detected and analyzed in like manner. When any deviation is discovered in these differential measurements, the result is used to adjust system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to correct the deviation on the next wafer to be processed. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, stepper <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is adjusted to correct for misregistration of successive metal layers detected by analyzer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. After metallization, an interlayer dielectric is deposited over the surface of the wafer in a dielectric deposition chamber <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> schematically illustrate a metallization pattern <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> formed on wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for the purpose of testing the mutual registration of successive metal layers, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a sectional view, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a top view of the wafer. The pattern comprises a lower grid of pads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of a first metal, say tungsten, which is overlaid by an upper grid of pads <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of a second metal, say aluminum or copper. The two grids are preferably formed in the course of processing wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and have a pitch on the order of the pitch of functional circuit features that are formed on the wafer. Preferably, the pattern is included in lithographic masks that are written onto the wafer by stepper <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> during successive photolithography cycles. In this manner, pads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are deposited onto a lower dielectric level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as part of a lower metal layer, after which pads <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are deposited onto an upper dielectric layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as part of an upper metal layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The masks are designed so that when the upper and lower metal layers are perfectly registered with one another, each of pads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is fully covered by a respective one of pads <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. When there is a misregistration of the metal layers, however, there will be an offset of the upper and lower grids, as shown in the figures. Similarly, if there is a discrepancy in the dimensions of the upper and lower pads, due to inaccurate control of etching parameters, for example, pads <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may not cover the respective pads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> completely. Thus, the mutual registration of pads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is indicative of the registration of the functional metal layers deposited on wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Because metal pads <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are relatively opaque to X-rays, the portion of pads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that are directly below corresponding pads <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> receive relatively little irradiation from source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, most of the X-ray fluorescence emitted from this covered portion of the lower pads will be absorbed by the corresponding upper pads. Therefore, when the upper and lower metal layers are perfectly registered, and pattern <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is irradiated by source <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the number of fluorescent photons received by detectors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the characteristic emission bands of the first metal (from which pads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are formed) will generally be small. Furthermore, the signals received by each pair of opposing detectors (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> vs. <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> vs. <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>) will be substantially symmetrical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when there is an offset between the metal layers, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, a portion of pads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is exposed to irradiation and contributes photons to the flux received by the detectors. The total magnitude of this flux gives a measure of the extent of misregistration between the metal layers. A reference flux level can be determined based on the detector signals measured in a characteristic emission band of the second metal, from which upper pads <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are formed. Even small errors in registration of the upper and lower pads, on the order of 1%, can be detected in this manner, so that corrective action can be taken before the errors become critical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the misregistration is relatively small, the direction and magnitude of the misregistration offset can be determined based on the difference between the fluorescence signals received from opposing detectors in the emission band of the first (lower) metal. Left-right misregistration (in the perspective of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is thus given by the difference in signals between detectors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, while up-down misregistration is given by the difference between detectors <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The differences between the signals are preferably normalized by a sum of the signals. Analyzer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thus provides feedback to stepper <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (or to an operator of the stepper) indicating not only that a registration error has occurred, but also giving an estimate of the amount and direction of adjustment that are needed in order to prevent the error from occurring in subsequent wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a schematic, sectional view of a detail of wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> under test in analyzer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, metal bumps <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> have been formed on an upper surface of the wafer. These bumps, typically about 0.1 mm across, are used for soldering microelectronic devices that are made from wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> onto suitable chip carriers, in place of wire bonding. Analyzer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used to ascertain that the composition and thickness of bumps <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> meet design parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> When only a single X-ray detector is used to capture fluorescent photons emitted from bumps <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as in XRF microanalyzers known in the art, the measurement of fluorescence intensity will be prone to error due to inaccurate alignment of spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with bump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The error arises from variations that occur in XRF emission as a function of the radiation angle relative to the surface of the bump. This difficulty is overcome by differential measurement using analyzer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, differences between the XRF signals received from detectors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are measured in order to determine how far off spot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is from the center of bump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. When the spot is perfectly centered, all of the detectors will give substantially equal signals. The differences between the signals are preferably provided as a negative feedback input to stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, so as to drive the bump into alignment with the irradiation spot. Alternatively or additionally, reliable XRF measurements can be made even when the spot is not perfectly aligned on the bump, by taking a sum or average of the signals received from the detectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred embodiments described herein deal specifically with measurements made on certain specific features of wafer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the principles of the present invention may be applied in a straightforward manner to measurement of other microscopic geometrical features on or near a surface of a semiconductor wafer. Furthermore, these principles may similarly be applied to the analysis of other types of microscopic features and structures, in samples other than semiconductor wafers, and to the control of production processes for making such features and structures. For example, the principles described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> may be applied in other contexts in which X-ray emissions are measured from a curved surface. The ratios of the signals received by the opposing detectors are indicative of the slope of the surface at the point of measurement. The location of the point of measurement may be adjusted, based on the ratios, to find a point of horizontal slope, as in the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, or to find another predefined slope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> It will thus be appreciated that the preferred embodiments described above are cited by way of example, and that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather, the scope of the present invention includes both combinations and subcombinations of the various features described hereinabove, as well as variations and modifications thereof which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description and which are not disclosed in the prior art. </paragraph>
