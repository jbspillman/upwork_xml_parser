<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of fabricating a package for a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) device. A flex circuit interconnect subassembly for the package is made by placing a flex circuit on a pad insert, attaching a carrier insert to the pad insert to deflect the lead portions of the flex circuit, and applying a cover insert to the pad insert, after the attachment of the carrier insert, to re-deflect the lead portions of the flex circuit toward the device bond sites. The flex circuit interconnect subassembly may be combined with an electronic device die/carrier subassembly to form a completed electronic device package. The flex circuit interconnect subassembly and the die/carrier subassembly are joined using mechanical interlocking layers. The invention is particularly suited for making such an electronic device die/carrier subassembly which has a MEMS die permanently affixed to a carrier. The carrier is advantageously utilized during the process of releasing a protective coating from the surface of the MEMS die which support the various MEMS components. The MEMS components on the MEMS die are hermetically sealed, such as by bonding a cover to the upper package body or the lower package body. The cover may have features such as ports which allow the MEMS components to interact with the external environment. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to the interconnection of electronic components, particularly micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and more specifically to methods of fabricating packages for MEMS devices to provide external electrical connections, e.g., to printed circuit board leads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As modem electronic devices have become more complicated, it has also become more difficult to interconnect their various components. For example, the physical size of microprocessors and integrated circuits (ICs) continues to shrink, but the number of leads provided on such chips is increasing due to added functionalities. The smaller size of the chips creates a problem when trying to provide connections between the chip leads and external devices or leads, such as those on a printed circuit board (PCB). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A state-of-the-art IC chip might be as small as one or two square centimeters, but have as many as 100 or more circuit leads. Typical interconnect spacing for the external leads is now on the order of 100-150 microns, and is expected to become even finer (e.g., 50 micron pitch). To reduce costs of assembly, semiautomatic or automatic insertion of components onto PCBs is often employed. Minor errors in the placement of these chips can accordingly result in mis-connection, leading to nonfunctional units, and oftentimes damage to sensitive electrical circuits within the chips. These problems can be compounded on multi-chip modules (MCMs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A variety of interconnection packages have been devised to assist in the placement of electronic devices. The package for a semiconductor device typically fulfills three functions. First, it provides environmental and physical protection for the silicon chip. Second, it provides a means to facilitate handling of the chip. Third, it provides electrical connections from the chip to the system in which it is installed. Packages are usually soldered to their circuit boards to physically and electrically connect the package to the circuit board. Other types of interconnection can be provided, such as optical or fluid ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An additional level of packaging in the form of a socket is sometimes used to electrically and physically connect the IC package to its printed circuit board. Sockets for IC packages are usually fitted with pins which are soldered to a circuit board. Pressure contacts can also be used, in which case the socket is pushed against the circuit board with screws, springs, or some other type of mounting hardware. In the latter configuration pressure contacts must have enough compliance or conformance to compensate for non-planarities present in the circuit board and/or the mounting surface of the IC package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One exemplary IC package is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,489. In that design, an integrated circuit die is mounted onto the upper surface of a multi-layer ceramic carrier, or spreader. A conventional solder-bump flip-chip (&ldquo;C4&rdquo;) process is used to connect the die to the substrate spreader. Interconnections can also be achieved using wire bonding, tape automated bonding (TAB), or elastomeric interconnects. The spreader is a multi-layered ceramic carrier, with vias forming connections between the layers. The bottom surface of the spreader has an array of contacts. A shell or cap is affixed to the spreader, surrounding and protecting the die. The spreader is placed in a molded plastic socket cover. The spreader and cover are further mounted on a socket base. The base has posts adapted to fit into corresponding holes of the circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Similar packaging and electrical interconnection considerations apply to micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). In the field of miniaturization, it is not only electronic devices that have shrunk, but mechanical structures as well. MEMS devices are very small systems that are fabricated with technologies much like those used to fabricate integrated circuits, but MEMS devices interact with their environment in more ways than a traditional IC. MEMS devices typically have physical structures or mechanisms on an upper surface that perform the desired interaction with the environment, e.g., mechanical, optical or magnetic interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> MEMS devices may include very small electromechanical components such as switches, mirrors, capacitors, accelerometers, inductors, capacitive sensors and actuators that combine many of the most desirable aspects of conventional mechanical and solid-state devices. Unlike conventional mechanical devices, MEMS devices can be monolithically integrated with integrated circuitry, while providing much improved insertion loss and electrical isolation over solid-state devices. Typically, the MEMS devices are anchored to and suspended above the substrate so that they can move. For example switches open and close, variable capacitors are trimmed or tuned, actuators move back-and-forth and accelerometers deflect. Oftentimes these devices perform multiple functions or are simultaneously subjected to more than one signal. For example, low frequency signals are used to open and close MEMS switches and trim or tune variable capacitors while they conduct a high frequency AC signal. Mechanical actuators respond to an electrostatic force produced by a low frequency signal while functioning as an actuator. Accelerometers deflect in response to acceleration forces and in turn can modulate an AC signal. One example of a MEMS device is the micromachined fluid sensor disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,259. In that design, side-ports are added to a dual in-line (DIP) type IC package, to provide fluid communication with sensors located inside the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The structures in MEMS devices are often quite robust when considered within the framework of their small size, but are very fragile relative to the macro-world of conventional IC packaging systems. Additional problems can arise relative to these devices, such as electrostatic and surface-tension induced attraction. Microscopic contamination can add to these problems and cause the device to fail when they induce detrimental electrostatic or surface-tension related attraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Surface micromachining, modified surface micromachining and frontside silicon-on-insulator (SOI) techniques are among those used to fabricate suspended MEMS devices. Surface micromachining uses standard deposition and patterning techniques to build-up the MEMS device on a substrate. Deposition and patterning techniques can also be used to build up the device on the surface of a substrate. MEMS devices are often fabricated such that the functional mechanism of the device remains buried within a sacrificial oxide material that is still present at the end of the &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; processing. At some suitable time prior to use or being completely packaged, the MEMS devices are released. The process of etching or otherwise removing the material that encases the components is often referred to as &ldquo;releasing&rdquo;. It is a common practice to saw a semiconductor wafer into individual dies prior to their &ldquo;release&rdquo;, so that particles from the sawing operation are less prone to foul the MEMS mechanisms. It is also common for the MEMS foundry to ship the die in the unreleased state. Shipping the MEMS die while still encased in its sacrificial oxide material (and having the foundry customer do the release of the device) helps reduce contamination of the device during shipping and handling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While the use of a release layer is very desirable to protect the delicate MEMS components, this approach creates further problems during &ldquo;back-end&rdquo; processing by the final manufacturer/assembler. The MEMS device cannot be fully (i.e., hermetically) sealed prior to release, and so can still become contaminated or damaged during installation. It would, therefore, be desirable to devise an improved method for handling the MEMS die and performing the release operation. It would be further advantageous if the method could utilize packaging which provided a cost-effective and space-efficient means of connecting the MEMS die to external electrical/electronic signals, while maintaining a hermetic cavity for the MEMS mechanism. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is therefore one object of the present invention to provide an improved method of interconnecting a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) device to external circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide such a method which facilitates the back-end release process of the MEMS die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a hermetic package for MEMS devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The foregoing objects are achieved in a method of fabricating a flex circuit interconnect subassembly for use with a MEMS device, generally comprising the steps of placing a flex circuit on a pad insert, wherein the flex circuit has lead portions adapted to interconnect with bond pads formed on an electronic device die, attaching a carrier insert to the pad insert to deflect the lead portions of the flex circuit from a first plane toward a second plane, and applying a cover insert to the pad insert, after the attachment of the carrier insert, to re-deflect the lead portions of the flex circuit toward the first plane. The flex circuit interconnect subassembly may be combined with an electronic device die/carrier subassembly to form a completed electronic device package. The invention is particularly suited for making such an electronic device die/carrier subassembly which has a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) die permanently affixed to a carrier. The carrier is advantageously utilized during the process of releasing a protective coating from the surface of the MEMS die which support the various MEMS components. In a preferred implementation the method uses a pin plate fixture, wherein the flex circuit is applied to the pin plate fixture, and then forced against the pad insert using the pin plate fixture. The carrier insert is attached to the pad insert while the flex circuit is applied to the pin plate fixture. The flex circuit interconnect subassembly is combined with the electronic device die/carrier subassembly after removing the pin plate fixture from the flex circuit and pad insert. The MEMS device package may have a cover providing various features for the MEMS devices, and may further have an overmolded body to provide a hermetic seal.</paragraph>

The cover is retained in slot <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed between pad insert <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and outer body <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The preferred method of fabricating package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The method begins with the pre-processing of MEMS die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. A standard die-attach machine can be used to perform the placement of MEMS die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> onto carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, since the MEMS mechanisms are encased in their sacrificial oxide (i.e., unreleased). Standard die-attach processing may involve the use of a vacuum-based end-effector (vacuum pipette) to pick up the die and place it onto a lead-frame die paddle or into a package body. The vacuum pipette would most likely damage most MEMS devices if it were to directly contact them, but in this method they are still protected by the sacrificial oxide and they will not be harmed by a conventional die attach processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> MEMS die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is attached to carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using conventional adhesive <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (e.g., unfilled-epoxy) to form a MEMS subassembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is used during the early stages of completing package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to holding MEMS subassembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> without having to directly grip MEMS die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and is encased in the final package. MEMS carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided with beveled edges that serve two primary functions. First, the detail on the edge of the carrier facilitates handling during the early stages of processing by providing a mechanical detail that is easy to grip. Second, the detail on the edge allows for MEMS carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be locked into place when the final package mold body is applied. As an alternative to beveling, a groove can be cut in the perimeter of the carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> MEMS subassembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is next processed by releasing the sacrificial oxide layer on die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This step may be accomplished, for example, by gripping MEMS carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and immersing die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into a bath of industrial (hydrofluoric) acid (HF). A likely material for the MEMS carrier is monel, since it is very resistant to HF. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows MEMS subassembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> after the MEMS mechanisms <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and bond pads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> have been released. In the illustrative embodiment, package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a 40-lead device. Higher or lower lead count packages are easily configured with the system proposed in this invention, since the outer-lead interconnect is based on ball grid array (BGA) interconnection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a 40-lead flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being placed onto a pin plate fixture <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Pin plate fixture <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is used only in the early assembly of package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is removed prior to package completion. Flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has inner leads <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which are configured to align with the bond pads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of MEMS die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is comprised of a flexible dielectric substrate on which there are thin and separate conductors provided to route signals and electrical power from the inner lead area to the outer lead area of an electronic package. As further seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, pad insert <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is placed onto the pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of pin-plate fixture <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and on top of flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Pad insert <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are mechanically aligned by the guiding action of pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in pin plate fixture <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Carrier insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which is assembled into flex circuit subassembly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from the bottom as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, provides final alignment of MEMS subassembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Carrier insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a sloping surface at its outer perimeter where it touches the inner-lead area of flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The purpose of this sloped surface on carrier insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is to bend the corresponding portions of flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> upward so that the inner leads <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be brought up to the plane of bond pads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on MEMS die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Carrier insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also has slots along its bottom edge that allow for the final package mold material to flow inward toward and interlock the perimeter detail of MEMS carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the final package. Carrier insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> self-aligns into pad insert <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and mechanically snaps into place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> With this orientation of flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the inner-leads are now deflected upward a skewed angle by the introduction of the carrier insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Cover insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then added to the sub-assembly as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Cover insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has details on each corner that interlock with pad insert <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to fix its position in the package. Cover insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> serves the function of deflecting the inner lead portion of flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> back into the horizontal plane, and also serves as a &ldquo;molding dam&rdquo; that keeps the final package mold material from flowing inward and encroaching onto the delicate MEMS mechanisms <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on top of the MEMS die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Cover insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may also have grooves on its lower surface that are sized to accommodate the conductor leads of the flexible circuit. Mold shut-off may also be achieved by embedding the leads into the substrate and using a plain-bottomed cover insert. By providing these grooves on cover insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, it may extend into the space between the inner-lead conductors and thereby keep high pressure mold flow from reaching the MEMS mechanism area (discussed below in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>). In an alternative embodiment wherein the final package mold cavity pressure is low enough that the material simply will not flow through these small inner-lead spaces, the carrier insert has a plain bottom (no grooves). Cover insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is self-guided into pad insert <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and mechanically snaps into place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a completed flex circuit subassembly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is then combined with the MEMS subassembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to result in a near-finished package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; at this point pin plate fixture <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has been removed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the joining of the two completed subassemblies. Flex circuit subassembly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be lowered onto a stationary MEMS subassembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, or the MEMS subassembly can be raised and inserted into the bottom of the interconnect sub-assembly. Carrier insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides three-dimensional alignment of the two subassemblies relative to each other. Carrier insert <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also overlaps a portion of the upper surface of MEMS carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that the final package mold flow is shut-off from reaching the MEMS mechanism area of the completed package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> This portion of the package is now ready for the operation of connecting the inner leads of flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with bond pads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on MEMS die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The inner-lead connection can be made a number of ways including wire bonding or TAB inner-lead bonding. With TAB bonding technology, the inner leads of the flexible circuit are cantilevered beyond the edge of the flexible circuit substrate and placed over bumps that have been provided on the MEMS die. The inner leads can then bonded to the bumps on the die with bonding technologies such as gang thermo-compression or single-point thermosonic inner-lead bonding. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the state of the fully assembled package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> after inner leads <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of flex circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have been connected to bond pads <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on MEMS die <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> After assembly, package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be subjected to a package mold process. Various techniques may be used to provide the final package mold, particularly transfer or injection molding techniques, or other molding or encapsulation processes, depending upon the characteristics of the material that will make up the final package overmolded body. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a simplified view of a mold cavity used to injection mold the final package body (mold flow porting is not shown). If a material such as liquid crystal polymer (LCP) is used, then the grooves on the bottom of cover insert <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> all of the clear space (areas not shown with section hatch lines), with the exception of the area just above the MEMS die, will fill with the final package material. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a cross-section of the overmolded package. The design of the inserts in the package advantageously provide for the final package mold material to flow into strategic locations to lock the package into one integral unit. The inserts further prevent the final package material from flowing into the MEMS device area on top of the MEMS die. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> also shows the addition of solder balls <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to the package as a ball grid array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The cover of the final package may have various characteristics. It may be transparent or opaque, metallic or elastomeric, or have ports for fiber-optic cables to enter into the MEMS device area, or for capillary tubes to enter into the MEMS device area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> An alternative MEMS package <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, in cross-section. As with the previous design, the design of MEMS package <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a MEMS die <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a carrier <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that is used during the early stage of completing the package, and is encased in the final package as well. The stepped edges on the perimeter of carrier <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> again serve to facilitate handling during the early stages of processing by providing a mechanical detail that is easy to grip, and further allow the carrier to be locked into place when the carrier is bonded to its mating package cavity, as explained further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> MEMS die <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is released as before, and carrier <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> facilitates handling of the MEMS die during the release process. After the release step, package assembly continues as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The MEMS subassembly <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> (MEMS die <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and carrier <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) is placed into a lower package cavity <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Then the top half of the package is first completed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Three operations are performed at this stage. The package assembler has several options regarding the order in which the following operations are performed. The wire bonds may be made before the upper package components are placed, or alternatively these bonds could be made just prior to sealing the cover onto the package assembly. An upper package cavity <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and a cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be placed and sealed at the same time, or alternatively upper package cavity <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> could be placed and sealed prior to cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> being processed. A &ldquo;getter&rdquo; may be trapped in the cavity area directly above the MEMS devices. At the time of the final sealing of package <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the package may have been evacuated (e.g. in a vacuum bake oven) and filled with a suitable inert gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Variations in the design of package <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> include different MEMS carrier profiles which still facilitate the handling of the MEMS die during release processing, such as a beveled MEMS carrier. A one-piece cover may also be used to complete the top half of the package, in lieu of upper package cavity <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. These constructions are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Two additional embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a &ldquo;cavity-up&rdquo; variation for this alternative package configuration. Package <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes many components which are similar to those previously described, including a MEMS die <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, a carrier <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, a cover <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, a flex circuit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, a stiffener <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and an overmold body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows the process of attaching MEMS die <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to carrier <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, followed by the release process. Carrier <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> again has appropriate mechanical details to enhance its function. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, hermetic cover <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> has been added to the face of the die. The hermetic lid can be bonded to the face of the MEMS die with a number of techniques including glass-frit, eutectic gold, or anodic bonding. A bonding perimeter is advantageously provided between the MEMS mechanisms and their interconnection pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows the next step in the assembly of package <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, that of attaching the substrate of flex circuit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to stiffener <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The substrate of flex circuit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> can be thermally laminated, or an adhesive can be used. Stiffener <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and flex circuit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are attached to MEMS carrier <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> using the interlocking features provided on the stiffener and the MEMS carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Once the flexible circuit and MEMS subassemblies are assembled into one unit, then the inner lead bonds can be made, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. This package <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> example shows the use of wire bonds to connect the I/O pads on the MEMS die to the flexible circuit leads. An alternative approach would be to have the flexible circuit lead cantilevered over and bonded to bumps that have been added to the bond pads on the MEMS die. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows the completed package after overmold body <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and solder balls <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> have been applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;cavity-down&rdquo; variation of the foregoing configuration is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In this configuration the MEMS carrier is on top of the package in the final assembly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> illustrates the process of attaching the MEMS die to its carrier, followed by the release process. An alternative interlocking detail is shown for the carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> depicts the attachment of the substrate of the flexible circuit to the stiffener, similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>; however, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> the stiffener with the interlocking detail is placed between the MEMS subassembly and the flex circuit, while in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> the flex circuit is placed between the MEMS subassembly and the stiffener with the interlocking detail. The stiffener and flex circuit are attached to the MEMS carrier using the interlocking features provided on the stiffener and the MEMS carrier. The inner lead bonds are again made, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, as wire bonds. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> shows the completed package after the overmold body and solder balls have been applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as alternative embodiments of the invention, will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is therefore contemplated that such modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
