<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A low voltage, broadband differential operational amplifier which eliminates the long tail current source from the amplifier, thereby relieving the headroom requirements by a few tenths of a volt. An input common mode feedback circuit is used to overcome the problems arising from the removal of the long tail current source of prior art circuits. This circuit monitors the common mode feedback current and when the value of the current exceeds a specified range around the nominal amplifier bias current, an appropriate correction in the common mode input voltage is made.

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of electronic circuits associated with operational amplifiers (op-amps) and in particular to low-voltage versions of these circuits suitable for use in various pipelined analog-to-digital converter and/or other portable applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Brief description of the Known Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a schematic for the well known &lsquo;telescopic cascode&rsquo; amplifier. A bandwidth of 500 MHz and a dc gain of 60 dB is achievable with this type circuit. This differential op-amp is comprised of cascoded n-channel input transistors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the V<highlight><subscript>ip </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>inputs, respectively, along with the long tail current source transistor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. P-channel transistors <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> act as an active load. The common mode adjust circuitry <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to compensate for a mismatch between tail current and the bias current by providing a common mode feedback (CMFB) signal to the gates of transistors <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The differential outputs V<highlight><subscript>Op </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>On </subscript></highlight>for the circuit are taken from the drains of n-channel transistors <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively. Because this amplifier is known to have a minimum number of non-dominant poles, the circuit has excellent bandwidth properties. This is primarily due to the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1) the p-channel transistors <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in the circuit do not carry any signal current. Thus, all capacitances associated with p-channel transistors <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as well as the gate-source and source-substrate capacitances of p-channel transistors <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> do not contribute any poles; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2) since the main non-dominant poles are contributed by the n-channel transistors, which can be kept small in size by tailoring their W/L layout for a given transconductance, the resulting poles will generally be at higher frequencies; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 3) the large capacitance often associated with a folded cascode amplifier, where three transistors have to &lsquo;meet&rsquo; at the folding node, is not present in this telescopic cascode amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The main problem with this conventional cascode operational amplifier circuit is that of low voltage headroom. Because so many transistors are stacked, it is difficult to realize this circuit when working at voltages as low as 2.5 volts or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A number of patents may be of interest in relation to the technology discussed above and in this patent, including but not limited to the following: </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A new differential, low voltage, broadband operational amplifier which eliminates the long tail current source from the amplifier, thereby relieving the low voltage headroom requirements, is disclosed. This advantage will allow the amplifier to operate from a power supply of less than 2.5 volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The circuitry of this invention compensates for the significant changes in drain current in the input transistors of the amplifier by monitoring the current in a common mode feedback signal. When the value of this current exceeds a specified range around the nominal amplifier bias current, an appropriate correction is made to the common mode input voltage. Using this circuitry which can be implemented with minimal chip area and negligible power consumption, an operational amplifier is built without a long tail current source that operates at voltages of 2.5 volts or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Two implementations for the control loop for common mode input voltage are discussed, although other implementations are possible. Simulated results for both a conventional amplifier and the operational amplifier of this invention, both running from a power supply of less than 2.5 volts, are compared. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic for a first embodiment of the modified operational amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with common mode adjust circuitry <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which addresses the low voltage headroom problem discussed in the earlier prior art discussion. Here, the long tail current source <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) has been eliminated completely, taking away the common mode rejection properties of the amplifier. As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this differential op-amp is comprised of cascoded n-channel input transistors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the V<highlight><subscript>ip </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>inputs, respectively, but with the long tail current source transistor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) eliminated. P-channel transistors <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> act as an active load. The common mode adjust circuitry <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to compensate for any change in the common mode input voltage of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As before, the differential outputs V<highlight><subscript>Op </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>On </subscript></highlight>for the circuit are taken from the drains of n-channel transistors <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively. As long as the common mode input voltage (V<highlight><subscript>CMI </subscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is kept equal to or approximately equal to one transistor V<highlight><subscript>GS </subscript></highlight>drop, this circuit can still be used as an operational amplifier. There are a number of applications where this circuit can be used, for example a fully differential switched-capacitor circuit often used in pipelined analog-to-digital converters, where there is little need for a high common-mode-rejection-ratio (CMRR) since all inputs and outputs are referenced to highly regulated internal bias voltages. This circuit requires a headroom which is 0.3V to 0.5 V smaller than the conventional long tail operational amplifier circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, in a general sense, if the input common mode voltage is different from the desired value, the drain current of input transistors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can exhibit large variations from their nominal values. One simple solution to this problem is to increase the range of the output common mode adjustment circuitry <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such that the current in transistors <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can accommodate the current variation in input transistors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and make the necessary corrections. However, this can result in large undesirable variations in the amplifier bandwidth, making it desirable to have a more sophisticated, higher performance approach to the common mode input voltage correction problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a schematic diagram for a switched-capacitor amplifier using the operational amplifier of the first embodiment of this invention. This circuit is chosen to illustrate the reasons why the common mode input voltage, V<highlight><subscript>CMI</subscript></highlight>, changes. The circuit is comprised of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of this invention, common mode adjust circuitry <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, four switched capacitors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, phase <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> switches <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and phase <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> switches <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and has differential inputs V<highlight><subscript>ip </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>and differential outputs V<highlight><subscript>op </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>on</subscript></highlight>. A clock cycle, consisting of phase <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (p<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) sampling phase and phase <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) amplification phase, for the circuit is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The operation of the circuit is as follows. During phase <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, when p<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>switches <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are closed, the top plates of all capacitors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>) are connected to the input common mode voltage V<highlight><subscript>CMI</subscript></highlight>, whereas the bottom plates of capacitors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) are connected to V<highlight><subscript>ip </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>, respectively, and the bottom plates of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (C<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) are connected to the output common mode voltage V<highlight><subscript>CMO</subscript></highlight>. Ideally, the common voltage of V<highlight><subscript>ip </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>would be the same as V<highlight><subscript>CMO</subscript></highlight>, as a result of the common mode feedback circuit of the previous stage. Then during phase <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the bottom plates of capacitors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (C<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) are connected to outputs V<highlight><subscript>op </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>on</subscript></highlight>, respectively, while the bottom plates of capacitors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) are connected to V<highlight><subscript>CMO</subscript></highlight>. Again, under ideal conditions, the common mode voltage at the amplifier input would be unchanged from phase <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to phase <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, in practice the common mode voltages of V<highlight><subscript>ip</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>op</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>on </subscript></highlight>are different from V<highlight><subscript>CMO </subscript></highlight>due to the non-idealities in the common mode feedback circuit of the preceding stage. This results in a change in the common mode input voltage of the amplifier during phase <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Another possible source of error is that of signal feed-through from the switches that are used for connecting the amplifier input nodes to V<highlight><subscript>CMI </subscript></highlight>during phase <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This can result in a change in the input common mode voltage V<highlight><subscript>CMI </subscript></highlight>during phase <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The combination of all these error sources can cause the common mode input voltage to change on the order of several tens of millivolts, which in turn can cause the drain current in input transistors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to change by as much as 25%, or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the method for correcting the common mode input voltage variations for this embodiment of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrates this input common mode correction for the switched-capacitor amplifier <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> application discussed earlier, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows this correction for a general-case amplifier application. In both cases (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) the amount of current supplied to amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the common mode feedback (CMFB) signal is monitored inside the common mode adjust circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Whenever this current exceeds a certain range, say &plusmn;10% of the nominal amplifier bias current, an over-range or under-range signal is generated by the common mode adjust circuitry <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This is then used to apply a suitable correction to the V<highlight><subscript>CMI </subscript></highlight>voltage by means of a correction voltage generator <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and summing circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This second correction feedback loop must be made slower that the main CMFB loop in order to avoid any signal &lsquo;chatter&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A first technique for correcting the common mode input voltage variations of this invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows the common mode feedback circuit which generates the V<highlight><subscript>CMFB </subscript></highlight>signal. This circuit is comprised on one side of two n-channel transistors <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for input signals V<highlight><subscript>OP </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>ON</subscript></highlight>, respectively, a current source <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a diode connected p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The other side of the circuit is comprised of a n-channel transistor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for the V<highlight><subscript>CMO </subscript></highlight>input signal, a diode connected n-channel transistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the same current source <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Another p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> couples the two sides of the circuit together. The inputs to the circuit are V<highlight><subscript>OP</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>ON</subscript></highlight>, and V<highlight><subscript>CMO </subscript></highlight>and the output is V<highlight><subscript>CMFB</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>consists of two current mirrors, each comprised of a p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a current source <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. This circuit monitors the V<highlight><subscript>CMFB </subscript></highlight>signal and generates two replicas of the common mode current supplied to the main amplifier. These currents are then compared with a lower current limit I<highlight><subscript>UR </subscript></highlight>and a higher current limit I<highlight><subscript>OR</subscript></highlight>, flowing in constant current sources <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, respectively. If the current in the I<highlight><subscript>OR </subscript></highlight>leg of the circuit exceeds the constant current I<highlight><subscript>OR</subscript></highlight>, then the V<highlight><subscript>OR </subscript></highlight>output signal will go high (UP). Likewise, if the current in the I<highlight><subscript>UR </subscript></highlight>leg of the circuit is less than the constant current I<highlight><subscript>UR</subscript></highlight>, then the V<highlight><subscript>UR </subscript></highlight>output signal will go low (DOWN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> These V<highlight><subscript>OR </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>UR </subscript></highlight>signals are then fed into the correction circuitry of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>In this circuit, the V<highlight><subscript>UR </subscript></highlight>signal is complemented by means of an inverter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and fed into the UP input of an UP/DOWN counter <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, while the V<highlight><subscript>OR </subscript></highlight>signal is feed into the DOWN input of the same UP/DOWN counter <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The counter <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> drives a low resolution (3-to-4 bits) digital-to-analog (D/A) converter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which generates a small correction current that is added to or subtracted from the current flowing in current source <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, which represents the nominal amplifier bias current. This total current is fed into a diode connected n-channel (M<highlight><subscript>BIAS</subscript></highlight>) transistor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is matched with the input transistors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the main amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In operation, the operational amplifier&apos;s output signals V<highlight><subscript>OP</subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>ON </subscript></highlight>are compared with the common mode output voltage V<highlight><subscript>CMO </subscript></highlight>and an appropriate common mode feedback signal V<highlight><subscript>CMFB </subscript></highlight>is generated. Any change in the V<highlight><subscript>CMFB </subscript></highlight>signal is reflected at the output of the current mirrors as an increase or decrease in the V<highlight><subscript>OR </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>UR </subscript></highlight>signals, respectively. These V<highlight><subscript>OR </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>UR </subscript></highlight>signals are then used to make the counter count clock pulsed either UP or DOWN. Finally, the output of the counter is converted back to an analog current and is added to or subtracted from the amplifier&apos;s nominal current and used to adjust the V<highlight><subscript>CMI </subscript></highlight>voltage, such as to maintain common mode between the operational amplifier&apos;s input and output signals. In practice, the circuitry associated with this correction implementation can be realized with a small amount of extra chip area and a negligible amount of power. The combination of the UP/DOWN counter and D/A converter can also be implemented using a charge pump and a capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A second technique for implementing the control loop for the common mode input voltage correction of this invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Here, the combinations of two n-channel transistors pairs <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are used to replicate the current flowing in the input transistors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the main amplifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. These are compared with reference currents I<highlight><subscript>UR</subscript></highlight>, which is slightly smaller than the nominal current, and I<highlight><subscript>OR</subscript></highlight>, which is slightly larger than the nominal current, that is flowing in the I<highlight><subscript>UR </subscript></highlight>current source <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the I<highlight><subscript>OR </subscript></highlight>current source <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, respectively. If the replicated current is outside of the established window for the I<highlight><subscript>UR </subscript></highlight>and I<highlight><subscript>OR </subscript></highlight>currents, a correction is applied to the V<highlight><subscript>CMI </subscript></highlight>using the same UP/DOWN counter circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> compares the simulation results for both a conventional operational amplifier and the new operational amplifier of this patent, both running from a 2.5 volt power supply. As shown, for a given input signal, a several tenths of volt improvement in the output amplitude is realized, making it a desired circuit for low voltage applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described in the context of a preferred embodiment, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be modified in numerous ways and may assume many embodiments other than that specifically set out and described above. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all modifications of the invention which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
