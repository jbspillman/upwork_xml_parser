<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to equipment utilized in conjunction with a subterranean well and, in an embodiment described herein, more particularly provides a well screen having a line extending therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is quite common to utilize lines extending into a well in order to perform certain functions, such as operating an actuator, monitoring well conditions, communicating data, etc. At times, such lines are used where well screens are interconnected in a tubing string. In these situations, it is usually difficult to run the lines across the well screens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For example, if the lines are attached to the tubing string so that they run externally across the screens, an outer dimension of the tubing string is increased. Since the screens are typically larger in diameter already compared to tubing in the tubing string, this dimensional increase due to the external lines further restricts passage of the tubing string through a given wellbore. In addition, the external lines are exposed to damage while running the tubing string, and are exposed to erosion due to fluid flow into the screens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> If the lines are run internally through the screens, the lines restrict fluid flow and equipment passage through the screens. Furthermore, the lines are exposed to erosion due to fluid flow through the screens, and are exposed to damage when equipment is run through the screens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it can be seen that it would be quite desirable to provide a method of extending lines through well screens, so that the lines are protected during conveyance of a tubing string into a well and during production of the well, and so that the lines do not restrict the conveyance of the tubing string in the well and do not restrict passage of equipment through the screens. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide such well screens having lines extending therethrough. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In carrying out the principles of the present invention, in accordance with described embodiments thereof, well screens are provided which include lines extending therethrough. In one embodiment, the lines are embedded in a material in a sidewall of the screen. In another embodiment, the lines extend between a filter media and an outer shroud of the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, the screen is configured for use with a coiled tubing string. The screen may have an outer dimension less than or approximately equal to an outer diameter of tubing in the coiled tubing string, so that conventional injector heads used to run the tubing may be used for running the screen as well. The screen may be wrapped about a reel for ease of deployment with the coiled tubing string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, the screen may be conveniently integrated into the coiled tubing string. For example, the screen may be formed continuously on the coiled tubing string, with there being no need to sever the tubing in order to interconnect the screen in the coiled tubing string. Instead, the screen is formed at a predetermined location in the coiled tubing string by forming openings through a sidewall of the tubing. The predetermined location corresponds to a desired position of the screen when the tubing string is deployed into a well. Multiple screens may be formed on the tubing string spaced apart to correspond to a desired screen spacing in the well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, the screen may be expandable. In this manner, a coiled tubing string may be deployed into a well with the expandable screen interconnected therein, and the screen expanded after it is appropriately positioned in the well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the invention, the line in the screen may be connected to various sensors, actuators and flow control devices. The line may also be connected to a tractor device, which conveys the tubing string including the screen in the well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and other features, advantages, benefits and objects of the present invention will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art upon careful consideration of the detailed description of representative embodiments of the invention hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Representatively illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a prior art method <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the following description of the method <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and other apparatus and methods described herein, directional terms, such as &ldquo;above&rdquo;, &ldquo;below&rdquo;, &ldquo;upper&rdquo;, &ldquo;lower&rdquo;, etc., are used only for convenience in referring to the accompanying drawings. Additionally, it is to be understood that the various embodiments of the present invention described herein may be utilized in various orientations, such as inclined, inverted, horizontal, vertical, etc., and in various configurations, without departing from the principles of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the method <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, individual well screens <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are interconnected in a tubing string <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as the tubing string is lowered into a wellbore <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The tubing string <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may include other items of equipment, such as packers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, etc. As each item of equipment or separate stand of tubing is interconnected to the tubing string <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the conveyance of the tubing string into the wellbore <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> must be halted, the item of equipment or stand of tubing must be connected (usually, threaded to the top of the tubing string, torqued up and pressure tested), and then the tubing string is again lowered into the wellbore until the next item of equipment or stand of tubing is added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> If lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are to be run with the tubing string <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, they are typically run externally as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. While the tubing string <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is being run into the wellbore <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are usually strapped to the outside of the tubing string. Unfortunately, this leaves the lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> exposed to damage and increases the outer dimension of the tubing string <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A fairly recent innovation is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,082,454, wherein screens are run into a well interconnected in a coiled tubing string. This method eliminates the need to halt conveyance of the tubing string while the well screens or stands of tubing are interconnected in the tubing string, but it substitutes another inconvenience in that a special deployment rig with variable opening injector heads must be used to accommodate the screens, which have a larger diameter than the tubing on a reel of coiled tubing. The method also does not solve the problem of running lines with the tubing string, as the method is described with the lines being run external to the tubing string. The disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 6,082,454 is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> well screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> embodying principles of the present invention is representatively illustrated. The screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> solves the problem of running lines with well screens in a tubing string. Specifically, the screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (only one of which is visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) embedded in a sidewall material of the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a tubular base pipe or body portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The base pipe <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a nonmetallic material in which the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be embedded during manufacture of the base pipe. Most preferably, the base pipe <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is made of a composite material specially adapted for use in a well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed through the base pipe <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to permit fluid flow through the screen sidewall. A screen jacket <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> outwardly overlies the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The screen jacket <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes an outer perforated shroud <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and filter media <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the filter media <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is made up of three layers of woven material sintered together, and the filter media is in turn sintered to the outer shroud. Such a screen jacket <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/574,658, filed May 18, 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference. However, it is to be clearly understood that otherwise configured screen jackets and other types of filter media may be used, without departing from the principles of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> cross-sectional view of the screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shown. Note that the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are alternated circumferentially with the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the base pipe <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and that seven of the lines are depicted. The lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be hydraulic, electric and/or fiber optic lines, and the lines may be used for communications, chemical injection, supplying power, controlling a downhole process, monitoring downhole conditions, etc. Of course, other types of lines may be used, and the lines may be used for other purposes, in keeping with the principles of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be used in a method, such as the method to described above or the method described in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,082,454 discussed above, wherein the screen is interconnected in a coiled tubing string conveyed into a well. In that case, the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> do not have to be run externally across the screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, but instead extend through a sidewall of the screen. In that case, suitable connections, such as threaded connections, would be provided at each end of the base pipe <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> could be formed directly on coiled tubing. The coiled tubing would be provided with the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extending in a sidewall of the tubing. In this case, the base pipe <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> would correspond to a portion of the coiled tubing. At a location on the coiled tubing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> corresponding to a desired position of the screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a well, the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> would be formed through the tubing sidewall, and the screen jacket <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> would be installed over the openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> This method permits the screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be formed continuously on the coiled tubing, without the need to sever the tubing in order to form connections between the tubing and the screen. This method also permits the coiled tubing string to be conveyed into a well without halting to interconnect the screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the tubing string. Furthermore, this method permits any practical length of the screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be continuously formed on the coiled tubing, since the screen may be deployed from a reel with the rest of the coiled tubing, and thus its length is not limited by the height of a rig at the well, or the need to have a rig at the well at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Still further, any number of the screens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be formed on coiled tubing. The screens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be spaced apart on the coiled tubing when it is on the reel so that, when the coiled tubing is deployed into the well, the spacing of the screens corresponds to predetermined desired spacings between the screens in the well. For example, if in the method <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above a well screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is substituted for each of the screens <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the tubing string <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a coiled tubing string having the screens continuously formed on the coiled tubing then, prior to deployment of the tubing string <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into the wellbore <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> the screens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be spaced apart at predetermined locations corresponding to their respective desired positions in the well after deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> well screen deployment system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> embodying principles of the present invention is representatively illustrated. In the system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a coiled tubing string <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is wrapped on a reel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Of course, the use of reels for deployment of coiled tubing strings is well known to those skilled in the art. However, in the system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, well screens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are interconnected to coiled tubing <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and are spaced apart on the reel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at predetermined locations corresponding to predetermined desired spacings between the screens in a well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The coiled tubing <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a composite or other nonmetallic material having lines, such as the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> described above, embedded therein. The screens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are separately constructed and are interconnected to the coiled tubing <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> using connections <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The screens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> also have lines, such as the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, extending therethrough. Thus, the connections <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> structurally connect the screens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to the tubing <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and interconnect the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to each other between the screens and tubing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Note that an outer diameter of the screens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is less than or approximately equal to an outer diameter of the tubing <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the outer diameter of the screens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is the same as the outer diameter of the tubing <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. By constructing the tubing string <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in this manner, no specially configured variable width injector heads are needed to deploy the tubing string into a well. Instead, the tubing string <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be deployed using conventional coiled tubing equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, another well screen deployment system <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> embodying principles of the present invention is representatively illustrated. In the system <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, screens <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are formed continuously on tubing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> wrapped on a reel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As in the system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the screens <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are spaced apart on the reel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at predetermined locations corresponding to predetermined desired spacings between the screens in a well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The screens <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are formed on the tubing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by forming openings <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> through a sidewall of the tubing. The openings <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> as being circular holes, but it is to be clearly understood that the openings <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be otherwise configured, for example, as slots, etc. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the openings <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> filter fluid flowing into the tubing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The coiled tubing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a composite or other nonmetallic material having lines, such as the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> described above, embedded therein. Thus, by forming the screens <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> directly on the tubing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the screens <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> also have the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extending through their sidewalls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Note that the screens <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> could each have a screen jacket, such as the screen jacket <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> described above, installed overlying the openings <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In that case, the screens <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> would be similar to the screen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, with the base pipe <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> corresponding to the coiled tubing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> well screen <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> embodying principles of the present invention is representatively illustrated. The well screen <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be used for any of the screens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> described above, or it may be used in other screen deployment systems. The screen <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is particularly suited for use in the deployment systems <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> described above, since the screen has a flush outer diameter, and thus it may be conveniently wrapped on a reel, and it may be deployed into a wellbore using conventional injector heads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The screen <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a body portion or base pipe <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> with one or more lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> embedded in a sidewall thereof The lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be similar to the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> described above and may be used to perform any of a variety of functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the material of which the base pipe <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is made is a nonmetallic composite material for convenience in embedding the lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> therein, but other materials may be used for the base pipe <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in keeping with the principles of the present invention. If the screen <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is used for one of the screens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the deployment system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, then the base pipe <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> would be separately constructed from the tubing <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. If the screen <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is used for one of the screens <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the deployment system <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, then the base pipe <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> would be a portion of the tubing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, i.e., the screen would be continuously formed on the tubing without severing the tubing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are formed through the base pipe <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> sidewall to permit fluid flow therethrough. The openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be alternated circumferentially in the base pipe <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> sidewall in a manner similar to that described above and depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for the lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Any number of lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The screen <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a screen jacket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> outwardly overlying the openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The screen jacket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be similar to the screen jacket <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> described above, in that it includes a perforated outer shroud <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and a multilayered filter media <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. However, other types of screen jackets or other filtering devices may be used in place of the screen jacket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, without departing from the principles of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The screen jacket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is installed in a recess <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> formed externally on the base pipe <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the screen jacket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> does not extend outwardly beyond the outer diameter of the base pipe <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the screen <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is interconnected in a coiled tubing string and wrapped on a reel, the screen does not interfere with the wrapping of the tubing on the reel, and does not require special equipment when the tubing string is deployed from the reel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> well screen <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> embodying principles of the present invention is representatively illustrated. The screen <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is similar in many respects to the screen <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, in that it includes a base pipe <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, lines <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, openings go, and screen jacket <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> similar to the base pipe <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and screen jacket <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the screen <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. However, the screen jacket <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the screen <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is attached to the base pipe <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> using ridges or serrations <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The serrations <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> serve to provide a gripping attachment between the screen jacket <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the base pipe <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The serrations <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> also provide an enhanced seal between the screen jacket <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the base pipe <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Of course, other attachment means and other sealing means may be used in keeping with the principles of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an alternate well screen construction <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> embodying principles of the present invention is representatively illustrated. The alternate construction <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> may be used in conjunction with well screens described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A sidewall portion of a screen <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, which includes a base pipe <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having openings <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> formed therethrough and a screen jacket <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> outwardly overlying the openings <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The base pipe <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a composite material, which has several advantages over conventional metal tubing, such as reduced weight, the ability to embed lines therein, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> However, many composite materials are more susceptible to erosion damage as compared to metals. For this reason, the screen <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes generally tubular shields or inserts <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> lining the openings <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the base pipe <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The inserts <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be made of metal or any other erosion resistant material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> To provide a resilient or flexible gripping force for installing the inserts <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in the openings <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, retainers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are used between the inserts and the openings. The retainers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are preferably made of a rubber compound or other resilient material, and the retainers may also provide seals between the inserts <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the openings <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Of course, other materials may be used for the retainers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and other gripping and/or sealing means may be used, without departing from the principles of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> well production system <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> embodying principles of the present invention is representatively illustrated. The system <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> takes advantage of some of the features of the well screens described herein. However, it is to be clearly understood that principles of the present invention may be embodied in many different well production systems, and the description of the system <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is given as merely an example of the wide variety of systems in which those principles may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the system <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> coiled tubing string <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is conveyed into a wellbore ii<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The tubing string <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> includes a packer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a flow control device such as a valve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a well screen <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a sensor <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and a tractor device <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. A suitable downhole tractor for use as the tractor device <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/245,468, filed Feb. 5, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The coiled tubing string <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> preferably utilizes a composite tubing in which one or more lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are embedded in a sidewall thereof. In many situations in which composite tubing is conveyed into a horizontal or highly deviated wellbore, the low density of the tubing makes it difficult to push the tubing through the wellbore. Thus, the tractor device <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is used in the system <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to convey the tubing string <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> through the wellbore <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> extends through the screen <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, as in the various well screens described herein, that is, the line extends through a sidewall of the screen. The ability to extend the line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> through the screen <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, without the problems associated with running the line externally across the screen or internally through an axial flow passage of the screen, permits the tractor device <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> on the end of the tubing string <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to be conveniently powered via the line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may also be used to receive indications of a parameter, such as pressure, temperature, etc., as sensed by the sensor <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> for monitoring well conditions, detecting the nature and makeup of fluid produced from the well, etc. The line <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may also be used to actuate the valve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and/or the packer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Of course, if multiple lines <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are provided, various of the lines may be used to perform separate functions. For example, a hydraulic line may be used to set the packer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, an electric line may be used to power the tractor device <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, a fiber optic line may be used for receiving indications from the sensor <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A &amp; B</cross-reference>, another well screen <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> embodying principles of the present invention is representatively illustrated. The screen <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is a radially expandable screen and is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> in a wellbore <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> prior to being expanded, and is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> after it has been expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The screen <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> includes a body portion or base pipe <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> which is preferably made of a composite material and has one or more lines <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> embedded in a sidewall thereof. The base pipe <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> also has openings formed through its sidewall, which openings are not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A &amp; B</cross-reference>, but which are similar to the openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> An expandable screen jacket <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> outwardly overlies the openings in the base pipe <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. An example of a well screen including a screen jacket being expanded is described in the incorporated U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/574,658. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> For expanding the screen jacket <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the screen <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, an inflatable membrane <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is provided between the base pipe <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and the screen jacket. Fluid pressure is applied to the interior of the base pipe <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to inflate the membrane <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> via the openings in the base pipe sidewall. Inflation of the membrane <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> forces the screen jacket <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> radially outward relative to the base pipe <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The screen jacket <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may be expanded outward into contact with the wellbore <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, for example, to provide support for an unconsolidated formation surrounding the wellbore. The use of the expandable screen <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may be useful in other situations as well, for example, to permit the screen to pass through a restriction in the wellbore <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> prior to being expanded. As another example, the well screen <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in its retracted configuration may have an outer diameter which is less than or approximately equal to the outer diameter of a coiled tubing string in which the screen is interconnected, so that the screen may be wrapped on a reel and deployed into the wellbore <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> using conventional injector equipment, and then expanded after the screen is appropriately positioned in the wellbore. The above are merely examples of a variety of situations in which use of the expandable screen <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> would be advantageous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> After the membrane <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> has been inflated, it is preferably dispensed with to permit fluid flow between the screen jacket <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the openings in the base pipe <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> sidewall. For example, a mechanism may be provided for withdrawing the membrane <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> from between the screen jacket <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and the base pipe <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. As another example, the membrane <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may be made of an acid soluble material, in which case an acid may be circulated through the openings in the base pipe <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to dissolve the membrane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Note that a membrane similar to the membrane <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may be incorporated into the other screens <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> described above, thereby making those screens also expandable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, another well screen <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> embodying principles of the present invention is representatively illustrated. The screen <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> includes at least one line <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> extending therethrough, but the line is not embedded in a sidewall material of the screen. Nevertheless, the line <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is protected from damage, since it does not extend externally across the screen <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, nor does it extend within an internal axial flow passage <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Instead, the line <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> extends within an annular space formed between an outer perforated shroud <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and a filter media <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the screen <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The annular space is maintained by centralizers <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> extending outwardly from a base pipe <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The centralizers <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> may also be used to secure the line <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in position in the annular space. The line <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be similar to any of the other lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Sensors and/or actuators <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> are connected to the line <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Such sensors may be used to sense parameters internal or external to the screen <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, and such actuators may be used, for example, to enhance distribution of gravel in a gravel packing operation. A description of the use of such sensors and actuators <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> in conjunction with a well screen is given in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/615,016, filed Jul. 13, 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Of course, a person skilled in the art would, upon a careful consideration of the above description of representative embodiments of the invention, readily appreciate that many modifications, additions, substitutions, deletions, and other changes may be made to these specific embodiments, and such changes are contemplated by the principles of the present invention. Accordingly, the foregoing detailed description is to be clearly understood as being given by way of illustration and example only, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited solely by the appended claims.</paragraph>
