<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a surface mount type semiconductor device having a lead-less structure, and more particularly to a semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the same in which common parts can be used among semiconductor devices having different package sizes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently, packages of components such as semiconductor integrated circuits, transistors, diodes and the like are downsized and made thin. In such components, existence of connecting leads gives large influence on the package size. Therefore, there is proposed a surface mount type semiconductor device having a lead-less structure in which connecting leads are not used. Especially, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device, it is required that a disposition pitch of connecting leads of a lead frame is minute, in order to realize a device having many lead pins. Also, width or thickness of each lead must be reduced and there is a possibility that the leads bend easily, causing short circuit between the leads. Alternatively, it is required that the package size is enlarged to realize a large disposition pitch of the leads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 9-162348 discloses a semiconductor device having such lead-less structure. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view of the semiconductor device disclosed in Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 9-162348. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40, a</cross-reference> semiconductor element (element chip) <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is fixed onto an element fixing resin board <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, and the upper side and peripheral area of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> are molded by package resin <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Also, there are provided a plurality of projected portions <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> on the bottom surface of the package resin <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. The surface of each of the projected portions <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is coated by a metal film <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. The metal films <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> are electrically coupled with the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> via bonding wires <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, within the package resin <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the metal films <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> function as mounting electrodes for mounting the semiconductor device onto a printed circuit board and the like. Thus, in the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>, mounting electrodes are formed directly on the bottom surface of the package, and it is not necessary to use a lead-frame. Therefore, it is possible to avoid the above-mentioned disadvantages caused by the lead-frame. Also, the package is effectively downsized and made thin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 9-252014 discloses another semiconductor device of this type. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view of a semiconductor device disclosed in Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 9-252014. The semiconductor device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> is fabricated as follows. First, a metal foil is shaped into predetermined patterns to form a die pad portion <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and a plurality of electrode portions <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. On the die pad portion <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor element <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is mounted by using mounting material <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. The electrode portions <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are then electrically coupled with the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> by using bonding wires <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and the bonding wires <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> are molded by package resin <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. In the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, the electrode portions <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are exposed at the bottom surface of the package resin <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. Thereby, it is possible to realize a surface mount type semiconductor device having a lead-less structure. Thus, it is possible to downsize and thin down the package. In Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 9-252014, a method is also disclosed in which, before patterning a metal foil, a semiconductor element is mounted on the metal foil and wire bonding is performed, and thereafter the metal foil is patterned into desired patterns. Also, Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 10-22440 discloses a technology similar to that described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, there is known a technology disclosed in Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 8-115989 and Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 8-115991. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view of a semiconductor device disclosed in Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 8-115989 and Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 8-115991. The semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference> has a frame-like terminal portion <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of column-like terminal portions <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> which are disposed within the frame-like terminal portion <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and which are insulated from each other and from the frame-like terminal portion <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> via resin portion <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. A semiconductor element <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> is disposed on a patterned layer <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> formed on the frame-like terminal portion <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and the column-like terminal portions <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor element <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled with the patterned layer <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> via bonding wires <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled with the column-like terminal portions <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> via conducting pattern portions of the patterned layer <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. Further, the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>, the bonding wires <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> and the like are molded by resin <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>. In this semiconductor device, the column-like terminal portions <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> are disposed in an area just under the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> as electrodes for mounting. Therefore, it is possible to realize a semiconductor device having a grid array structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In each of the conventional semiconductor devices mentioned above, a relatively large number of fabrication steps are required and fabrication process becomes complicated, thereby manufacturing costs are increased. That is, in the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>, it is necessary to provide the projected portions <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> at the bottom surface of the package resin <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, and to form the metal film <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> on the surface of the projected portions <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. The method of manufacturing such semiconductor device disclosed in Japanese patent laid-open publication No. 9-162348 is as follows. First, a metal base member is formed in which recessed portions are provided at portions corresponding to the projected portions <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. The metal film <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is then selectively formed in each of the recessed portions. Then, mounting of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and electrical connection between the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and the metal film <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> via bonding wires <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> are performed. Thereafter, molding by the package resin <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is performed. The metal base member is finally removed to fabricate the semiconductor device. In this method, number of processes for selectively forming the metal film <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is relatively large, and it is necessary to use the metal base member which becomes unnecessary after the completion of manufacturing. Therefore, manufacturing cost of the semiconductor device becomes large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, an etching process is required to pattern a metal foil into desired patterns when the die pad portions <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the electrode portions <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are formed. Therefore, manufacturing process becomes complicated. Also, it is necessary to use a base member for supporting the metal foil when the metal foil is patterned. Since this base member becomes unnecessary after manufacturing the semiconductor device, it causes an increase in the manufacturing cost of the semiconductor device, as in the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. When the metal foil is patterned after packaging the semiconductor element, the base member becomes unnecessary. However, since the etching process is performed by wet etching, it is necessary to perform water-resistant protection of the package when the etching is performed. Therefore, manufacturing process becomes complicated and, in this respect, manufacturing costs of the semiconductor device become large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, in the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>, the pattern layer <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> is required between the frame-like terminal portion and the column-like terminal portions <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> mounted thereon for selectively and electrically coupling the bonding wires <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> with the column-like terminal portions <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a large number of components are required and manufacturing costs of the semiconductor device become large. Also, number of manufacturing processes increases and manufacturing process becomes complicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, the above-mentioned conventional semiconductor devices have common problems as follows. In order to fabricate the above-mentioned semiconductor devices, components such as the metal film portions <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, the electrode portions <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> each made of a metal foil, the column-like terminal portions <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, the pattern layer <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> and the like are required as mounting terminals. It is necessary that these components are previously designed and manufactured into predetermined electrode arrangement patterns and sizes in compliance with kinds and sizes of the semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when a semiconductor element having different kind or size is to be mounted, it is necessary to again design and fabricate the above-mentioned components having different patterns and sizes. Also, when the components are to be previously fabricated and prepared, it is necessary to prepare a plurality kinds of components applicable to a plurality kinds or sizes of semiconductor elements. Therefore, manufacturing and management of the components used for fabricating the semiconductor devices become complicated. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings, embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an outside perspective view of a semiconductor device according to a first embodiment of the present invention wherein a part of the semiconductor device is cut away. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a plan view schematically showing an internal structure of the semiconductor device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view of the semiconductor device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> taken along the center line thereof. The semiconductor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> device shown in these drawings comprises die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> such as a semiconductor integrated circuit chip, bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and package resin or a package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are formed from a conductive plate member, here a metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is mounted on the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> via mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> made of silver paste and the like. The bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> electrically couple between electrode pads <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The packaging resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> covers and seals the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. A part of the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> enters between the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and, thereby, the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are joined together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Here, each of the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has a structure in which one board-like metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is divided into square segments. Among the segments divided from the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a plurality of segments in the central area form the above-mentioned die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Also, a plurality of segments around the central area form the above-mentioned lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, a resist film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> made of an insulating material is formed on the backside surface of the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> such that the segments forming the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are not exposed at the backside surface of the package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> are cross sectional views each showing a condition in which the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the above-mentioned structure is mounted on a mounting substrate <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The mounting substrate shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> has a wiring circuit portion <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> made of a conductive film formed into predetermined patterns. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be mounted on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> as follows. That is, first, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Then, solder portions <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> previously formed by a printing method and the like are reflowed by heating. Thereby, lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as mounting electrodes of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are soldered onto the wiring circuit portion <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be mounted on the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> as follows. That is, first, on the bottom surface of lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, solder balls <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> are attached. The semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the solder balls <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> are pressed onto the wiring circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> of the mounting substrate <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> while heating the solder balls <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and the like. Thereby, the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are coupled with the wiring circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. When the solder balls <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> are used as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, there is little possibility that the bottom surface of the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> contact the wiring circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to omit the resist film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> An explanation will now be made on a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the first embodiment of the present invention. FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B are top or bottom plan views and cross sectional views taken along the center lines of the top or bottom plan views, illustrating a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the first embodiment in order of manufacturing steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> As shown in the top plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A and in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, there is prepared a metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> which has a rectangular shape, here a square shape, and which is made of copper, 42 alloy and the like. The metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has a thickness of, for example, approximately 0.1-2 mm. Then, a plurality of concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> are formed on the surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in each of X direction and Y direction. The concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> are formed, for example, by using a dicing saw and the like which are used for cutting a semiconductor wafer into separate chips. In this case, half-cut dicing is performed such that the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> are formed to a depth which is approximately a half of the thickness of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the surface portion of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is zoned into squares or into a lattice-like arrangement. It is also possible to form the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> on the surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by press working which uses a metal die. Further, it is possible to form the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> by etching which uses a photolithographic technology. Here, the width of each of the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> may vary depending on a type and the like of the semiconductor device. However, it is preferable that the width of each concave trench <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is sufficiently large such that enough insulation between terminals can be obtained. Also, the sizes in lateral and longitudinal directions of each area between the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, that is, an individual piece in the lattice arrangement zoned or divided by the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> are determined by the wire-bondable pitch size, the size of external terminals, and the like. Here, the individual piece zoned by the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is finally divided into a separate piece and, therefore, is referred to as a divided segment or a segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in the top plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A and in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B, a</cross-reference> semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is mounted on the surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. As the mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, metal solder such as silver past and the like, conductive resin, and the like are used. The semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is positioned such that the surface having electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> thereon faces toward upside, and the backside surface of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is bonded onto the face surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, here the upper surfaces of a plurality of segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> divided by the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. In this case, the mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> enters and fills the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in an area under the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> mounted on the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Thereby, among the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>existing in an area under the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are joined together by the mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. These segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>later form die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, as shown in the top plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A and in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the upper surface portions of the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are respectively coupled by bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. In this case, the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> which are coupled with the electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are those not joined together by the mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. That is, among the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, all or part of the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are disposed outside the above-mentioned segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are selected as the segments to be wire bonded. These segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>later form lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As shown in the top plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A and in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B, a</cross-reference> package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is then formed. This is done, for example, as follows. First, the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is set in a metal mold for shaping resin not shown in the drawing, and the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is formed by resin molding on the surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, resin is applied on the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to a predetermined thickness. Thereby, the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is formed. Here, it should be noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is a partially cut away plan view. The semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> on the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> are resin molded by the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. In this case, portion of the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> fills the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> which separate between the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>corresponding to the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> under the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>corresponding to the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in the peripheral portion of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Also, portion of the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> fills the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> which divide between the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Therefore, each of the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>corresponding to the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is joined to the adjacent segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and to the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>corresponding to the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, via the insulating resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Then, as shown in the bottom plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A and in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, the bottom side of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is polished away such that at least half of the thickness of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is removed. This is done, for example, by mechanical polishing, or by chemical polishing such as etching and the like. By this polishing, the bottom portions of the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are also removed and, as a result, each of the segments <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is formed as a piece completely zoned by the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. However, since, as mentioned above, the segments <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> are joined together by the mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, these segments are not separated from each other. Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, an insulating resist film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is selectively applied on an area where the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>corresponding to the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> exist, on the bottom surface of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the resist film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may be formed by a printing method. Thereby, the bottom surface of the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are coated by an insulator. It is also possible to apply the resist film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> after a package separating process mentioned later. Further, if unnecessary, it is possible to omit forming the resist film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. For the sake of easy understanding, the resist film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is not illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As shown in the bottom plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A and in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is cut along the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in the outside portions of the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>corresponding to the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> by full-cut dicing. Thereby, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed which has a rectangular outer shape and which has a plurality of lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> comprising a plurality of segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disposed along the periphery of the bottom surface of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A conductive surface of each of the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is exposed in the periphery of the bottom surface of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can function as mounting electrodes. In this way, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is completed. In case the semiconductor device is a semiconductor device which requires a high heat dissipating effect at the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, for example, a semiconductor device in which a power semiconductor element is mounted, it is possible to use a structure in which the resist film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is not formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, in the semiconductor device according to the first embodiment, the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is mounted via the mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> on the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> having the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> formed into a grid or lattice shape. The electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are disposed in the periphery of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and which are not joined by the mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are then electrically coupled via the bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Then, molding by the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is performed and thereby the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be fabricated. In the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> are previously formed by half-cut dicing, and the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is divided into separate segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> after performing resin molding. Therefore, it is not necessary to use a base member for supporting a plurality of pad portions like the prior art method, and it is possible to decrease the number of components necessary to fabricate a semiconductor device. Also, in a polishing process of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> after the molding by the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, it is possible to adopt a mechanical polishing process, so that a manufacturing process does not become complicated. Further, a patterned layer required in the prior art for electrically coupling lead pad portions and electrodes of a semiconductor element is not required in the present embodiment. As a result, a structure of a semiconductor device becomes simple, and a manufacturing process thereof can also be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Also, in this embodiment, a plurality of segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> divided by the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> formed in the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are used as die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> or as lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In this respect, it is possible to freely select any segment <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> as a die pad portion <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> or a lead pad portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is possible, for example, to manufacture semiconductor devices from semiconductor elements having different sizes, i.e., different outer dimensions or from semiconductor elements having different number of electrodes, by using the same metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

However, since the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>have mutually different sizes, the number of divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>joined together by the mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> under the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the number of divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>joined under the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>differ from each other. That is, the area of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in which the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> exist differs from that of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Also, corresponding to such difference, the number and locations of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disposed in the periphery of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> differ from those of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disposed in the periphery of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>That is, the number and/or locations of the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> differ from those of the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>In this condition, the molding process is performed by the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is cut at the outer periphery of the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having different package sizes are fabricated. The same kind of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be used for fabricating the semiconductor devices <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Thus, it is possible to fabricate the semiconductor devices <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which have different sizes and which include semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having different sizes, by using the same metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>, in the method as a first variation of the first embodiment, when the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is mounted on a metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a mounting tape <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is used as mounting material. The mounting tape <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is a double-faced adhesive tape. The lower surface of the mounting tape <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is adhered to surfaces of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> formed in the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The upper surface of the mounting tape <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is adhered to the backside of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The process steps after this condition may be the same as those described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> in the first embodiment, and detailed description thereof is omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In the method according to the first variation of the first embodiment, the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> can be mounted on the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by a simple process. That is, it is only necessary that the mounting tape <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is adhered to a surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and that the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is placed on the mounting tape <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the first variation, when compared with the process of the first embodiment in which the mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is applied onto the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, it is possible to easily fabricate the semiconductor device. Here, the plurality of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>constituting the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> just under the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are mutually joined by the mounting tape <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference>, when the molding by the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is performed, it is preferable that portions of the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> enter into and fill the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> between the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Thereby, it is possible to enhance the strength of unifying the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>i.e., the die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by the package resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> An explanation will now be made on a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device as a second variation of the first embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> are a partially cutaway top plan view and a cross sectional view, respectively, illustrating a condition of a semiconductor device as the second variation during manufacture. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> show a condition corresponding to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> in the manufacturing process according to the first embodiment. In this variation, during a molding process by resin material, the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by potting or dropping the resin material from just above the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The process steps performed before and after obtaining this condition are the same as those in the first embodiment, and explanation thereof is omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> According to the second variation, it is possible to make the shape of the upper surface of the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into an arced surface or a spherical shape, or into a surface shape near the spherical shape, by the surface tension. Thus, it is possible to reduce the thickness of the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the cutting portions. Therefore, when the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is cut into separate semiconductor devices, the quantity of the resin portion to be cut becomes very small and, therefore, it is possible to cut the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>quite easily. Also, since there exists a resin material for the potting process which has a relatively low hardness when cured, it is also possible to cut the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into separate semiconductor devices by using a metal die. Therefore, it is possible to reduce cutting costs. Further, each of the semiconductor devices cut by this method does not have corner portions on the top surface thereof. Thus, probability of chipping or cracking of the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>becomes small. As a result, it is possible to improve reliability of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be made on a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the second embodiment of the present invention in order of manufacturing steps. First, in a manner similar to the process in the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, grid shaped or lattice shaped concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> are formed in a metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by half-cut dicing and, thereby, divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are formed. Then, as shown in a top plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A and in a cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>B, semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is mounted facedown on the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a plan view showing the face side surface, that is, the surface which is mounted on the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>On the face side surface of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>there are disposed electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>along the peripheral portion thereof. Locations of the electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>correspond to the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> formed in the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. That is, in this embodiment, the electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are disposed along the periphery of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in a pitch corresponding to that of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. On each of the electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>there is formed a ball-like bump <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> which is made of metal such as solder, gold and the like. The bumps <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can also be formed by selective plating. The face surface of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is opposed to and pressed toward the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> while heating the bumps <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> and the like, thereby the bumps <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> are respectively bonded to the surfaces of the corresponding divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. That is, the flip-chip bonding is performed. Therefore, each of the electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is electrically coupled with a corresponding one of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, as shown in a partially cutaway plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A and in a cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B, a</cross-reference> package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed. In the second embodiment, the molding by the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is performed such that portions of the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>enter into and fill the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> between the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> and the space between the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, as shown in the bottom plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>A and in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>B, the bottom side of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is polished away such that the bottom portions of the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are removed. As a result, each of divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is formed as a piece completely zoned by the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. In this case, since, as mentioned above, the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are joined together by the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>these divided segments are not separated from each other. Among the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> bonded with the bumps <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>constitute lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and function as mounting electrodes. The divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> which are located under the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and which are not bonded with the bumps <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> constitute die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> which are insulated from the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and which hold the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Thereafter, although not shown in the drawing, the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is cut along the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in the outside portions of the segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> corresponding to the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is completed as shown in a bottom plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>A and in a cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, it is also possible to form solder balls <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> on the backside of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> as the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference>. In this way, it is possible to mount the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on a mounting substrate by using the solder balls <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, in a manner similar to the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Here, as the second embodiment, an example is shown in which a semiconductor device is fabricated by mounting a semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that is previously separated into a chip on the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. However, it is also possible to fabricate semiconductor devices by using a semiconductor wafer which includes semiconductor elements but which is not yet separated into individual chips. This method is now explained as a third embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</cross-reference> and FIGS. <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D are perspective views and cross sectional views, respectively, illustrating a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the third embodiment in order of manufacturing steps. First, as shown schematically in the perspective view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A, a</cross-reference> plurality of semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> disposed in a lattice like arrangement are formed on a semiconductor wafer having a disk shape, for example, a silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Then, bumps <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> are formed in the periphery of each of the semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in a manner similar to that of the above-mentioned second embodiment. Since the semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> can be fabricated on the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> by using a conventional technology, an explanation thereof is omitted here. On the other hand, as shown schematically in the perspective view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B, a</cross-reference> square metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is prepared which has a side length approximately equal to a diameter of the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. As in the first embodiment, concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed on whole surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in lattice shape by half-dicing, thereby divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are formed. In this case, a pitch of disposition of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is set equal to a pitch of the bumps <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> along the periphery of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, or to a pitch of the lattice arrangement of the bumps <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

As shown in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>C, the backside of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is then polished until the bottom portions of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are exposed, that is, until the resin <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> filling the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is exposed. By this polishing, the individual divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are separated from each other. However, the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are kept unified by the resin <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> filling the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>but electrically isolated with each other. The divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to which the bumps <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> are bonded function as lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>that is, mounting electrodes. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>C, die pad portions are not shown, but the semiconductor device has the die pad portions. Thereafter, as shown in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>D, the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are cut along dicing lines, that is, scribe lines, of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> by full-cut dicing. Thereby, the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is divided into separate semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also divided at the portions of the resin <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. Thus, a plurality of semiconductor devices <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are fabricated. Also, before or after the dividing process, solder balls <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> are formed on the surface of the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The structure of the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment resembles the structure of the semiconductor device according to the above-mentioned second embodiment. However, in the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the third embodiment, both the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and the group of the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>have the same external size. Also, in the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a package resin which coats and seals the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> does not exist and does not cover the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to make the semiconductor devices more compact and thinner. In the semiconductor device according to the third embodiment, although the resin <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> filling the space between the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is used, the package resin is not required. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the quantity of resin required for manufacturing the semiconductor devices, and cost of the semiconductor devices can be reduced. Further, in the manufacturing process of the semiconductor device according to the third embodiment, it is possible to perform a dicing process for dividing the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> into a plurality of semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and a dicing process for cutting the resin <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> in the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the same time. Also, it is possible to omit a process of individually mounting a plurality of semiconductor element chips onto the respective metal plates. Therefore, it is possible to simplify the whole manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings, an explanation will now be made on a first variation of the third embodiment. In this variation, divided segments constituting lead pad portions and die pad portions are formed such that the cross section of each of the divided segments has a crank shape. Thereby, it is possible to mitigate thermal stress caused between a semiconductor device and a mounting substrate when the semiconductor device is mounted on the mounting substrate. Thus, a reliability of a semiconductor device in a condition it is mounted can be improved. A silicon wafer used in this variation is worked similarly to the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> used in the above-mentioned third embodiment. However, a metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>used in this variation differs from the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>used in the third embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a partial enlarged perspective view of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>used in this variation. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a square shaped metal board which has concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>formed on the face surface and on the backside surface thereof respectively. The concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the face side surface each have a depth approximately 40-50 percent of the thickness of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and are formed in X and Y directions in a lattice shape. The concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on the backside surface each have a depth approximately 40-50 percent of the thickness of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and are formed in X and Y directions in a lattice shape. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a schematic plan view showing a relationship between the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, for the sake of easy understanding, widths of the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are neglected. The concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the face surface side (shown by solid lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) and the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on the back side (shown by dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) have the same width of the trenches and the same pitch of the trenches.

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>A, the bumps <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are bonded to the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>on the face side surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as in the above-mentioned third embodiment. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>B, resin <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is injected into a space between the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C, a</cross-reference> photoresist mask <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is formed on the back side surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The photoresist mask <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> covers areas which are to be left as lead pad portions and die pad portions in the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight><cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is a schematic plan view illustrating the areas in which the photoresist mask <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is to be formed. For the sake of easy understanding, schematic locations of the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, although the width of each of the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is neglected. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the photoresist mask <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is formed as minute rectangular pattern portions which are disposed regularly in the X and Y directions and which have the same pitches as those of the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>When the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are perspectively viewed from the back surface side of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>each of the minute patterns of the photoresist mask <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is disposed such that both a part of a concave trench <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a part of a concave trench <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are covered by the minute pattern. Since a portion of each minute patterns of the photoresist mask <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is buried into a concave trench <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>each minute pattern of the photoresist mask <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> has a gourd-like solid shape. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>D, the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is etched through the whole thickness by using the photoresist mask <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> as an etching mask. Thereby, divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are formed as independent pieces. Thereafter, the remained photoresist mask <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is removed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a schematic perspective view illustrating a solid shape of each of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight>As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25, a</cross-reference> cross section of each of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>in the direction of the thickness becomes a crank shape.

<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>E, the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are cut at predetermined locations by a dicing saw and divided into pieces each having a predetermined size. Thereby, individual semiconductor devices <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed. In this case, the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is already divided by the process steps described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23D</cross-reference>. Thus, in practice, it is only necessary to cut the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the resin <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> in the cutting process illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23E</cross-reference>. In the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>each of the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a shape which is bent into a crank-like shape. When the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is mounted on a mounting substrate as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, there is a possibility that stress is applied on the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>due to the difference of thermal expansion coefficients between the mounting substrate and the semiconductor element of the semiconductor device. However, even in such case, it is possible to absorb such stress at the crank-like bent portion of each lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Thereby, it is possible to avoid breakage of coupling between the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the mounting substrate. Therefore, reliability of mounting of the semiconductor device can be improved. Although not shown in the drawing, it is possible to fill the spaces between the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>with resin and to flatten the backside of the semiconductor device, and, thereafter, to form a solder ball on the backside surface of each of the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Alternatively, in place of the solder ball, it is possible to form a solder plated portion and the like on the backside surface of each of the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Even in such case, it is possible to retain the above-mentioned function of mitigating the stress by the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> An explanation will now be made on a second variation of the third embodiment. In the above-mentioned first variation, the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fabricated by forming the photoresist mask on the backside surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and by selectively etching the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>However, if the width of each of the concave trenches formed in lattice shape is enlarged, it is possible to omit the process of selectively removing the metal plate by etching.

As mentioned above, on the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, there are formed semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> disposed in a lattice arrangement. Also, as in the third embodiment, bumps <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> are formed in the peripheral portion of each of the semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, a metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is prepared which is a square shaped metal board and which has the side length approximately equal to the diameter of the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Then, concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are formed on the face side surface thereof, and thereby divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>are formed.

In this way, by forming the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>from the backside of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>it is possible to form individually divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g. </italic></highlight>Each of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>has a crank-like cross section in the direction of the thickness thereof. Thereafter, although not shown in the drawing, the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are cut at predetermined locations by a dicing saw and divided into pieces each having a predetermined size. Thereby, individual semiconductor devices are formed. In this case, the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is already divided in the process steps for forming the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>on the backside described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</cross-reference>. Thus, in practice, it is only necessary to cut the silicon wafer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the resin <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the cutting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</cross-reference>, and FIGS. <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>D, an explanation will be made on a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a metal plate is at first full-cut diced to form separate divided segments, and the divided segments are used to constitute die pad portions and lead pad portions. As shown in a top plan view of FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>A and in a cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>B, an adhesive sheet <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is stuck on the backside surface of a metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>having a predetermined size. The adhesive sheet <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> holds divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>which are divided in a later process. Also, the adhesive sheet <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> has a thickness and a stiffness sufficient to maintain flatness of the sheet. Then, as shown in a top plan view of FIGS. <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A and in a cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>B, the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is full-cut diced from the face side surface, and concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>extending in X and Y directions are formed in the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>Thereby, the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>are formed which are disposed in a lattice shape. Although these divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>are completely separated, a condition of initial arrangement of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>is maintained by the adhesive sheet <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, process steps approximately similar to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> of the first embodiment are performed. That is, as shown in a cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A, a</cross-reference> semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is mounted on the surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>by using a mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Then, as shown in a cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>B, electrodes of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>which become lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>located in the periphery of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are electrically coupled by bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. As shown in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>C, resin is then molded or applied on the surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>Thereby, a package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed which molds the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, as shown in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>D, the adhesive sheet <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> stuck on the backside surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is peeled off. Thereby, it is possible to fabricate a semiconductor device according to the fourth embodiment which has a structure similar to that of the first embodiment. Differing from the first through third embodiments, in the fourth embodiment, it is not necessary to perform polishing of the backside surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>Although not shown in the drawing, when a plurality of semiconductor elements are molded together by a package resin portion, it is possible to obtain separate semiconductor devices by cutting the package resin portion into individual pieces. Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, an insulating resist film may be or may not be selectively applied on the backside surface of each of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>constituting die pad portions <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned fourth embodiment, the adhesive sheet <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is used which is not required as a constituent of the semiconductor device. In this point, the fourth embodiment may not be advantageous in reducing the number of components required for fabricating the semiconductor device. An explanation will now be made on a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device as a variation of the fourth embodiment. This method does not use such unnecessary component, but realizes fabrication of a semiconductor device in a manner similar to the fourth embodiment. FIGS. <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>F are schematic cross sectional views illustrating a manufacturing method of this variation in order of manufacturing steps. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A, a</cross-reference> resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is bonded on the backside surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight>The resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is made of material which does not adhere to solder and the like and which has high heat resistance and high moisture resistance. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> is a schematic plan view illustrating the resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, in the resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, openings <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed at portions corresponding to locations in which mounting electrodes of a semiconductor device to be fabricated are disposed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>B, as in the fourth embodiment, a metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is full-cut diced to form concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>extending in X and Y directions and, thereby, separate divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>are formed in lattice arrangement. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> is a schematic plan view illustrating a positional relationship between the opening portions <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j. </italic></highlight>As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>are formed in a predetermined pitch such that locations of portions of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>correspond to the locations of the openings <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. The divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>are hold in a unified condition by the resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, process steps approximately similar to those of the above-mentioned fourth embodiment are performed. That is, as shown in a cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>C, two semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are mounted on the surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>by using mounting material portions <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Then, as shown in a cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>D, electrodes of the semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>which become lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>located in the periphery of the semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are electrically coupled by bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. As shown in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>E, resin <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is then molded or applied on the surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight>Thereby, a package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is formed which molds the semiconductor elements <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is cut and also the resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is cut to fabricate individual semiconductor devices. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>F, solder balls <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> are joined on the backside surface of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>as the lead pad portions <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>exposed via the openings <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. In this case, since the resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> does not have adhesiveness with the solder, there is little possibility that the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>exposing via adjacent openings <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are short-circuited by the solder. As a result, the resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> functions like the resist film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment. In this variation, the resist sheet <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> which supports the divided segments obtained when the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is full-cut diced can be used as the resist film on the backside of the semiconductor device as it is. Therefore, components can be effectively utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> In the fourth embodiment and the variation thereof, the semiconductor elements are mounted on the metal plate while keeping the surface of the semiconductor elements on which the electrodes are formed upside. Then, the electrodes of the semiconductor elements are electrically coupled with the divided segments by the bonding wires. However, in these structures, it is also possible to form bumps on the surface of each of the semiconductor elements and to mount the semiconductor elements on the metal plate in the face-down manner, as in the second embodiment, such that the bumps are coupled with the divided segments of the metal plate. In such case, it is also possible to mount a silicon wafer on which a plurality of semiconductor elements are formed on a metal plate, and to perform molding by package resin. Thereafter, the silicon wafer is cut to form separate semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor devices according to the above-mentioned embodiments and variations thereof, lead pad portions and die pad portions are formed by using divided segments obtained by dividing a metal plate. However, it is also possible to finally remove a portion of the metal plate in an area corresponding to die pad portions, that is, divided segments, and to form the die pad portions by using mounting material. Such method will now be explained as a fifth embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A and 36B</cross-reference> are plan views and cross sectional views, illustrating a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device as the fifth embodiment in order of manufacturing steps. First, as in the first embodiment mentioned above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, a plurality of concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>extending in X and Y directions are formed in a square shaped metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>to form divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>in lattice arrangement. Thereafter, as shown in the top plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>A and in the cross sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33B, a</cross-reference> central area of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is caved toward the backside of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>by press work. Thereby, a concave portion <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is formed in the central area of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight>In this case, the level of the inner bottom portion of the concave portion <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> becomes lower than the level of the backside surface of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f, </italic></highlight>that is, the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k, </italic></highlight>at the peripheral portion of the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>which is not caved. </paragraph>

Also, the mounting material <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are made of material such as silver paste and the like which has high moisture resistance and high heat resistance and which has some mechanical strength. Thereafter, electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the face side surfaces of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>disposed in the periphery of the semiconductor element <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are electrically coupled via-bonding wires <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>C, the metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is polished or etched flat from the backside thereof until reaching the bottom portions of the concave trenches <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j. </italic></highlight>By this polishing, the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>are divided into individual pieces. In this case, the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>are unified by the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>but are electrically isolated from each other. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>D, the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is cut into separate pieces by using a dicing saw not shown in the drawing. In this case, the package resin portion <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>can be cut into pieces each having a pair of the divided segments <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>which include the divided segment <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>as the die pad portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and the divided segment <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>as the lead pad portion <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight>By appropriately selecting cutting portions, it is possible to fabricate individual diodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> each including one diode chip as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A and 37B</cross-reference>, or to fabricate diode arrays <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>each including a plurality of diode chips as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38A and 38B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In the sixth embodiment, it is possible to use a single standardized metal plate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>even when discrete diodes, or various diode arrays including various number of diode chips are to be fabricated. The diode chips are mounted on such metal plate and molded by package resin. By only changing the portions to be cut finally, it is possible to form discrete diodes, or various diode arrays including various number of diode chips. Therefore, it is not necessary to prepare a plurality kinds of lead members to fabricate a plurality kinds of diode arrays. Also, it is not necessary to prepare a plurality kinds of molding die for package resin. Therefore, it is possible to simplify a manufacturing process, and to reduce costs of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned first through sixth embodiments and the variations thereof show typical embodiments or examples of the present invention. By appropriately combining these embodiments and the like, it is possible to provide further diversified semiconductor devices and method of manufacturing the same. Also, with respect to a technique in each of the process steps described in the embodiments and variations thereof, it is possible to replace it by any of various conventionally proposed techniques while retaining advantageous effects mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, in a semiconductor device according to the present invention, a plurality of divided segments are formed from a conductor plate or board, and lead pad portions are constituted of the divided segments which are electrically coupled with electrodes of a semiconductor element. Therefore, by appropriately determining which divided segments are used as lead pad portions depending on the size and kind of each of the semiconductor elements, it is possible to commonly utilize the divided segments for the semiconductor elements having different sizes and kinds to form device packages. Also, it is possible to form die pad portions by using portions of the divided segments and to mount a semiconductor element on the die pad portions. In this case, other portions of the divided segments are used as lead pad portions and electrodes of the semiconductor element are electrically coupled with the lead pad portions via the bonding wires. Alternatively, it is possible to electrically couple bumps provided on electrodes of a semiconductor element with divided segments to form lead pad portions. Thereby, it is possible to mount or dispose a semiconductor element in face-up condition or in face-down condition. The lead pad portions may be disposed in the periphery of the package, or may be disposed in the bottom portion of the package in lattice-like arrangement. The same standard conducting plate can be utilized to fabricate surface-mount type semiconductor devices having lead-less structure, even if the semiconductor devices have different sizes and/or kinds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> In the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present invention, divided segments are defined by forming concave trenches in a conductor plate. A semiconductor element is mounted on the divided segments, and the semiconductor element and the divided segments are electrically coupled. Thereafter, the backside portion of the conductor plate is removed to form individual divided segments. Therefore, it is possible to easily perform a process of mounting a semiconductor element, a process of electrical connection between the semiconductor element and the divided segments, and a process of forming a package resin portion. Also, it is possible to fabricate a semiconductor device which has a plurality of lead pad portions finally insulated from each other. Therefore, according to the present invention, the number of parts and the number of process steps do not increase uselessly, and manufacturing process can be simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However, one of ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention as set forth in the claims below. Accordingly, the specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense, and all such modifications are to be included within the scope of the present invention. Therefore, it is intended that this invention encompasses all of the variations and modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
