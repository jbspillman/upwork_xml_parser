<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to interior vehicle lighting systems and lighted switch assemblies used for automotive applications. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Interior lighting systems for automotive and other vehicle applications are generally used for two purposes. One is to provide general area illumination and the other is feature lighting of specific objects, either for aesthetic or functional reasons. Traditionally, these interior lighting systems have utilized incandescent lamps for both area and feature lighting, often using lenses to control the shape and light intensity distribution of the emitted light. Although incandescent lamp systems can often be integrated into various vehicle interior trim components in a simple manner, various considerations do arise which complicates their use for automotive lighting. For example, where heat from the lamp could damage adjacent components or otherwise cause problems, thermal management of that heat must be implemented. Also, there is often little room in or behind a particular vehicle interior body panel or trim component for the lamp, socket, and lensing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This constraint on space behind the vehicle panels can be especially true with vehicle headliners where there may be little room between the headliner and roof of the vehicle. For headliners, the solution has typically been to either require more room between the headliner and roof or to utilize a light assembly that protrudes downwardly from the headliner for a short distance. Where sufficient space is available, various functional components such as electrical conduits, lamp soffits, electrical connectors, HVAC ducts, flat speakers, and head airbags can be molded into the headliner during its manufacture. See, for example, European Patent Application EP 0979760, published Feb. 16, 2000. However, where the headliner thickness is to be kept to a minimum, the use of molded-in lamp soffits may not be practical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The use of alternative light sources, such as electroluminescent panels, has been proposed for a wide range of vehicle lighting applications. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,864,473 to Tokarz et al. discloses an electroluminescent panel dome lamp designed for a convertible-type automobile. The panel is mounted on a housing that is attached to the headliner of the convertible&apos;s roof. U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,967 to Hirotaka et al. discloses a detachable electroluminescent panel light source that can be located at various places about the inside of a vehicle to provide illumination. These locations include inside the trunk, at the glove compartment, and on the backside of the front seats. U.S. Pat. No. 5,564,813 to Curtindale discloses a sun visor that includes incandescent light sources to provide courtesy, reading, and vanity illumination. The patent states that electroluminescent lighting strips could be used in place of the incandescent lamps. However, while various automotive lighting uses of electroluminescent panels have been proposed, as exemplified by these patents, much of the prior art discloses the use of electroluminescent panels as a direct substitute for incandescent and/or LED lamps without taking full advantage of the unique structural features of the electroluminescent technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a general object of the invention to provide a vehicle interior lighting system that can be used to provide area or feature lighting in a manner that minimizes the aesthetic impact of the light source when not in use and that requires negligible space behind the interior body panel or trim component where the light source is located. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to various interior vehicle assemblies that provide illumination using electroluminescent panels. In accordance with one aspect, the present invention is directed to a vehicle interior component assembly that includes a vehicle interior component having a fabric disposed over either a substrate or foam layer (or both). An electroluminescent panel is located between the fabric and substrate (or foam layer) and is configured to direct light from the panel through the fabric. In this way, the light source can be effectively hidden when not in use and can be incorporated into the interior component in a manner that requires little, if any, space behind the interior component. The vehicle interior component can be any of a number of different interior articles, including, for example, a headliner, door panel, vehicle seat, rear deck, sun visor, and trunk panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a vehicle carpet utilizing an electroluminescent panel, with the carpet including a substrate and a carpet pile attached to the substrate. The electroluminescent panel is mounted underneath the carpet pile and is configured to direct light from the panel through the carpet pile. A vehicle carpet so constructed can be used as a floor mat or as installed floor carpet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a vehicle instrument panel utilizing an electroluminescent panel to provide downwardly-directed light. The instrument panel includes a lower surface that faces towards a floor area of the vehicle when installed, with the lower surface having a light-transmitting region. The electroluminescent panel is mounted within the instrument panel behind the lower surface at the light-transmitting region, and electroluminescent panel is configured to direct light from the panel through the light-transmitting region of the lower surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a vehicle interior illumination system that includes a light source, a switch assembly, and an electronic circuit for energizing the light source. The switch assembly includes at least one light-transmissive touch switch and an electroluminescent panel that is located behind the touch switch to provide back lighting of the touch switch upon energization by the electronic circuit. The electronic circuit is connected to the light source, touch switch, and electroluminescent panel, and is operable upon activation of the switch to energize the light source and to change energization of the electroluminescent panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a vehicle interior lighting and switch assembly, comprising a light-transmissive touch switch, a light source disposed behind the touch switch, and an electronic circuit connected to both the touch switch and light source. The light source comprises an electroluminescent panel and the circuit is operable upon activation of the touch switch to energize the electroluminescent panel to thereby provide area illumination through the touch switch. A vehicle lighting and switch assembly constructed in this manner can be used for dome lights and map lights within the vehicle.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown an embodiment of a headliner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as it might be constructed in accordance with the invention. Although the following description is primarily directed to the use of the invention to provide illumination from headliner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it will of course be appreciated that, in its broader aspects, the invention is directed to a vehicle interior component assembly that uses one or more electroluminescent panels to provide interior vehicle illumination, and that the invention can thus be used for any of a wide variety of interior trim articles and other vehicle interior components. For example, it can be used in conjunction with door panels, instrument panels, floor carpeting, floor mats, trunk panels, occupant seating, sun visors, and rear decks, as will be described further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To provide general area illumination at each of the four main occupant seats of a typical automotive sedan, headliner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes four electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that are spaced within headliner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at locations corresponding to the main occupant seats. As shown in the schematic of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are connected to an electronic circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that includes a controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for each of the panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For simplicity, only two of the electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and their corresponding switches <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are shown. Controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives operating power from the vehicle battery (not shown) and is operable to energize each electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> independently of the other panels when its corresponding switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is activated. Each switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be a manually activated switch positioned within the vehicle at a location that allows the occupant of any of the four main seats to activate the light corresponding to that seat. Of course, the switches could also be wired to a second set of switches on an operator console to permit the driver to activate, de-activate, or even block activation of any of the panels. Optionally, the panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be controlled by a vehicle computer (not shown). In this regard, the circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (or controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> itself) can include a timer circuit that controls the length of time that the panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are illuminated. Similarly, controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can also include suitable circuitry for control of the brightness level of the panels. The design and implementation of these different electrical circuits is well known to those skilled in the art and no further discussion of these circuits is therefore necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As is also known by those skilled in the art, the electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are substantially flat panels that can be formed into a variety of shapes and sizes. They are energized by suitable operating power from controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The construction and use of such panels is also well known and therefore no further explanation of their construction or operation is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, there are shown a number of fragmentary, cross-sectional views of some of the different possible embodiments of one of the electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as it can be integrated into headliner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Headliner <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be made using conventional techniques and can include three primary layers&mdash;a relatively rigid fiberglass substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an intermediate foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a fabric layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that is exposed to the occupants for an aesthetically pleasing look and feel. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be disposed between the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with the panel oriented to direct light through foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and fabric <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Together these layers are typically translucent such that suitable illumination from panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> discontinuity or opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be formed in the foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with the electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> attached in place within this opening. This arrangement prevents the bulging of the foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and fabric <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. It also permits light transmission that is unimpeded by the foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Although electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown having a smaller thickness than foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, it will be appreciated that the relative thickness of panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be selected as appropriate for any particular vehicle application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can also be attached within a recessed portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This recess can be formed as a part of the original molding of substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and has the advantage that it helps locate the proper position of the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during assembly. Also, in instances where either substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed in a molding process, the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be molded in place so that it is co-bonded to either the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts yet another embodiment in which the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is exposed to the occupants of the vehicle by placing it onto the foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in an opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the fabric. The fabric layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can simply abut and terminate at panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A, a</cross-reference> bezel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be used around the periphery of the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to provide proper fit and finish. The exposed panels can allow for many options, such as touch controls, information display, or styling features. In this regard, the panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> need not be used for area illumination or passenger-specific illumination. Rather, they can be used for styling features, such as a light strip that extends about the periphery of the headliner or a sun roof. The panels can also include text, vehicle logos, or other graphics that are discernable by the occupants when the panels are illuminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is that, in each instance, the electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are concealed from the vehicle occupants until illuminated. However, the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference> illuminate through both the foam and fabric layers, whereas the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> requires the formation of an opening in the foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. To maintain the concealment of the panels in a simple manner while maximizing the light illuminating down on the passengers, the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> can be utilized. In this embodiment, the panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are each located between the fabric layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and foam layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (not shown). To further increase the light output, the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can be used, with the panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being covered by a different fabric <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> having a more open weave to increase the light throughput. The two fabrics <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be joined by seams <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, by using one or more of the electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the headliner, mood, ambiance, reading, and general cab lighting can be provided using a light source that occupies essentially no space. Also, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the lighting system can instead incorporate the panels onto other interior vehicle components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be incorporated into other fabric-surfaced interior components, such as a door panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or seat riser <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The various techniques discussed above in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for incorporating the panels into a fabric-surfaced component can be used for these applications as well. In addition to or in lieu of their use in fabric-surfaced components, the panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can also be incorporated into other interior components such as an instrument panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> or floor carpet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. For the instrument panel, the panel can be located at a lower surface that faces the floor area of the vehicle when the instrument is installed as shown. The lower surface has a light-transmitting region which can comprise either a translucent portion of the instrument panel or perforations of the instrument panel through which light from the electroluminescent panel is transmitted. When used with the floor carpet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the electroluminescent panel can be located underneath the carpet pile, either above or below the substrate on which the carpet pile is attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be incorporated into one or more trunk panels <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, using the construction techniques discussed above in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, there is shown another carpet application in which the electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is incorporated into a floor mat <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the same manner discussed above in connection with the floor carpet <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Also, the panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be incorporated underneath the fabric on the seat backs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the front driver and passenger side seats. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, there is shown a sun visor <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which can include an electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mounted underneath the visor fabric on either or both sides of the visor. Finally, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, there is shown an electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> incorporated into a rear deck <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, again underneath the fabric layer to hide its presence when not illuminated. For both the sun visor and rear deck applications, the various implementations disclosed in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>, a second use of electroluminescent panels for vehicle interior lighting systems will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is an exploded view of a lighted, touch switch assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a schematic showing the use of a switch assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a vehicle interior illumination system <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Switch assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes as its primary components a set of light-transmissive touch switches <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a corresponding set of electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, each of which are aligned with one of the touch switches <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to thereby provide back lighting of the switches. Appropriate indicia can be printed on each of the touch switches to identify the function of each switch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, and as shown, a light-transmissive graphics overlay <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can be provided with the desired indicia. When assembled, the switches <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, panels <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and overlay <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> form a backlit, low profile switch assembly having a thickness of only a few millimeters. This provides great flexibility in placement of the switch assembly within the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The electronic circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is shown as it would be connected to a single one of the touch switches <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and electroluminescent panels <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a controller <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and light source <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which is used to provide illumination in response to activation of its corresponding touch switch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is operable in response to activation of switch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to energize light source <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and to change the energization of the panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> used to back-light switch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. This change in energization of panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be, for example, switching-on of the panel so that it provides illumination of the switch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as an indication that the light source <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is on. Conversely, since the activation of the light source may be self-evident, the switch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can be normally illuminated by operation of the panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> when the light source <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is switched off, with controller <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> then changing the energization of panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> so that it is off when the light source <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is switched on. In this way, the switch is illuminated and may be seen in the dark when the light source <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is off. In yet another variation, the panel can be illuminated at different levels of energization so that, for example, it glows dimly when the light is off and brightly when it is on (or vice-a-versa). This multiple-level brightness control can also permit the brightness to be varied automatically according to ambient light levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Although shown symbolically as a conventional incandescent lamp, light source <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can of course be an electroluminescent panel itself. More generally, light source <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can instead be some other electronically-actuated device, such as a motor or solenoid, in which case its corresponding touch switch <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can be any of the various function switches used in the vehicle, including door lock switches, window switches, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>, a third use of electroluminescent panels for vehicle interior lighting systems will now be described. In particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> depicts a vehicle interior lighting and switch assembly <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> also showing a controller <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that is connected to and forms a part of the lighting and switch assembly <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The assembly <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be mounted to a vehicle headliner (not shown) and includes a dome light and integral switch, as well as separate driver and front passenger map lights with integral switches. The dome light comprises a central electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> located underneath a light-transmissive touch switch <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> that can be manually activated by an occupant to switch on the dome light <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> via controller <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Similarly, each of the map lights comprise an electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> located behind a corresponding touch switch <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Only one of the map switches and lights are shown connected to the controller <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, although it will of course be understood that the other map light/switch and dome light/switch would also be connected as well. In each case, activation of one of the switches <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> causes controller <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to switch on the corresponding electroluminescent panel <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> with the light from the panel transmitting though the switch and into the interior of the vehicle. The dome lamp <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can also be separately controlled to switch on, for example, when any of the vehicle doors are opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It will thus be apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention several vehicle interior lighting systems and lighted switch assemblies which achieve the aims and advantages specified herein. It will of course be understood that the foregoing description is of preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention and that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments shown. Various changes and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, the two-layer switch/light assembly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference> can be used for other lighting applications as well, including for example reading lights for the rear occupants. All such variations and modifications are intended to come within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
