<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to microlasers and associated fabrication methods and, more particularly, to Q-switched microlasers and associated fabrication methods. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Modern electro-optical applications are demanding relatively inexpensive, miniaturized lasers capable of producing a series of well-defined output pulses. As such, a variety of microlasers have been developed which include a microresonator and a pair of at least partially reflective mirrors disposed at opposite ends of the microresonator to define a resonant cavity therebetween. The microresonator of one advantageous microlaser includes an active gain medium and a saturable absorber that serves as a Q-switch. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,394,413 to John J. Zayhowski, which issued on Feb. 28, 1995, the contents of which are incorporated in their entirety herein. By appropriately pumping the active gain medium, such as with a laser diode, the microresonator will emit a series of pulses having a predetermined wavelength, pulse width and pulse energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As known to those skilled in the art, the wavelength of the signals emitted by a microlaser is dependent upon the materials from which the active gain medium and the saturable absorber are formed. In contrast, the pulse width of the laser pulses emitted by a conventional microlaser is proportional to the length of the resonator cavity. As such, longer resonator cavities will generally emit output pulses having greater pulse widths. Further, both the pulse energy and average power provided by a microlaser are proportional to the pulse width of the pulses output by the microlaser. All other factors being equal, the longer the microresonator cavity, the longer the pulse width and the greater the pulse energy and average power of the resulting laser pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventional microlasers, such as those described by U.S. Pat. No. 5,394,413, are end pumped in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis defined by the resonator cavity. In this regard, the longitudinal axis of the microresonator cavity extends lengthwise through the resonator cavity. Since the resonation cavity is generally a rectangular solid, the longitudinal axis is oriented so as to be orthogonal to the pair of at least partially reflective mirrors that define the opposed ends of the resonant cavity. As such, conventional microlasers are configured such that the pump source provides pump signals in a direction perpendicular to the at least partially reflective mirrors that define the opposed ends of the resonant cavity. The effective length of the resonator cavity is therefore equal to the physical length of the resonator cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> While the microlaser can be fabricated such that the resonator cavity has different lengths, a number of factors contribute to generally limit the permissible length of the resonator cavity. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,394,413 that states that the resonator cavity, including both the saturable absorber and the gain medium, is preferably less than two millimeters in length. In particular, a number of electro-optical applications require microlasers that are extremely small. As such, increases in the length of the resonator cavity are strongly discouraged in these applications since any such increases in the length of the microresonator cavity would correspondingly increase the overall size of the microlaser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In addition, the length of passively Q-switched microlasers is effectively limited by the requirement that the inversion density must exceed a predetermined threshold before lasing commences. As the physical length of the resonator cavity increases, greater amounts of pump energy are required in order to create the necessary inversion density for lasing. In addition to disadvantageously consuming more power to pump the microlaser, the increased pumping requirements create a number of other problems, such as the creation of substantially more heat within the microlaser which must be properly disposed of in order to permit continued operation of the microlaser. In certain instances, the heat generated within the microlaser may even exceed the thermal capacity of the heat sink or other heat removal device, thereby potentially causing a catastrophic failure of the microlaser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Since the pulse width and correspondingly the pulse energy and average power of the pulses output by a microlaser cavity are proportional to the length of the resonator cavity, the foregoing examples of practical limitations on the length of the resonator cavity also disadvantageously limit the pulse width and the corresponding pulse energy and average power of the pulses output by conventional microlasers. However, some modem electro-optical applications are beginning to require microlasers that emit pulses having greater pulse widths, such as pulse widths of greater than 1 nanosecond and, in some instances, up to 10 nanoseconds, as well as pulses that have greater pulse energy, such as between about 10 &mgr;J and about 100 &mgr;J, and greater average power, such as between 0.1 watts and 1 watt. As a result of the foregoing limitations on the length of the resonator cavity and the corresponding limitations on the pulse widths, pulse energy and average power of the pulses output by the conventional microlasers, conventional microlasers do not appear capable of meeting these increased demands. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A microlaser is therefore provided according to one embodiment of the present invention that is capable of supporting a zig-zag resonation pattern in response to pumping of the active gain medium so as to effectively lengthen the microresonator cavity without having to physically lengthen the microresonator cavity. As such, the microlaser of these embodiments can generate pulses having greater pulse widths and correspondingly greater pulse energies and average power levels than the pulses provided by conventional microlasers of a similar size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the microlaser includes a microresonator having an active gain medium and a Q-switch, such as a passive Q-switch proximate to and, in one embodiment, immediately adjacent to the active gain medium. In advantageous embodiments, the active gain medium and the Q-switch are integral such that the microresonator may be a monolithic structure. The microresonator extends lengthwise between opposed end faces. The microlaser also includes first and second reflective surfaces disposed proximate respective ones of the opposed end faces to define a microresonator cavity therebetween. While the first and second reflective surfaces can be coated upon respective ones of the opposed end faces of the microresonators, the first and second reflective surfaces can also be formed by mirrors that are spaced from respective ones of the opposed end faces. The microlaser can also include a pump source for introducing pump signals into the active gain medium via at least one of the end surfaces of the microresonator such that the zig-zag resonation pattern is established within the microresonator cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one advantageous embodiment, the opposed end faces are each disposed at a nonorthogonal angle &agr;, such as between about 30&deg; and about 45&deg;, relative to a line perpendicular to a longitudinal axis defined by the microresonator cavity and extending between the opposed end faces. In one embodiment, the opposed end faces are each disposed at the same nonorthogonal angle &agr; relative to the longitudinal axis such that the opposed end faces are parallel. In another embodiment, the opposed end faces are oriented in opposite directions by the same nonorthogonal angle &agr;. As a result of the nonorthogonal relationship of the opposed end faces, the microlaser of either embodiment is capable of supporting the zig-zag resonation pattern in response to pumping of the active gain medium via at least one of the end surfaces of the microresonator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> By supporting the zig-zag resonation pattern, the effective length of the microresonator cavity is increased relative to conventional microlasers having substantially the same physical size that do not support a zig-zag resonation path. In this regard, the effective length of the microresonator cavity of the present invention is the length of the zig-zag resonation path established by the microlaser which is significantly longer than the linear resonation paths established by conventional microlasers that extend parallel to the longitudinal axis of the resonator cavity. As such, the microlaser of the present invention can emit pulses having a longer pulse width and correspondingly greater pulse energies and average power levels than the pulses emitted by conventional microlasers of the same physical size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to permit the pump signals to be received by the active gain medium without being reflected from the end face, the microlaser can include an antireflection coating on the end face through which the pump signals are delivered for permitting pump signals having a predetermined range of wavelengths to be received by the active gain medium. The microresonator also generally includes a plurality of side surfaces extending between the opposed end faces. In order to further facilitate resonation within the microresonator cavity, the plurality of side surfaces can be roughened, such as by grinding, to thereby diffuse light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In order to permit the microlaser to emit signals of a predetermined lasing wavelength via one of the opposed end faces, the first reflective surface is preferably highly reflective for laser signals having the predetermined lasing wavelength. In contrast, the second reflective surface is preferably only partially reflective for laser signals having the predetermined lasing wavelength. As such, the microlaser can emit laser pulses having the predetermined lasing wavelength via the second reflective surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the microlaser also includes a heat sink upon which at least the microresonator is mounted and a housing in which at least the microresonator is disposed. In this embodiment, the housing includes a window through which laser signals generated by the microresonator are emitted.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to one advantageous embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The microlaser includes a microresonator having an active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a Q-switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as a passive Q-switch, proximate to the active gain medium. Typically, the active gain medium and the passive Q-switch are immediately adjacent to one another. However, the active gain medium and the passive Q-switch may be proximate one another even though one or more intervening layers may be disposed between the active gain medium and the passive Q-switch. Additionally, the active gain medium and the passive Q-switch are preferably integral and, in at least some embodiments, form a monolithic structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While the microresonator of one advantageous embodiment is fabricated by epitaxially growing the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> upon the Q-switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as described below, the microresonator can be fabricated by epitaxially growing the Q-switch upon the active gain medium or in other manners. For example, the active gain medium and the Q-switch can be joined by a diffusion bond or by optical contact in which the active gain medium and the Q-switch are attracted with coherent forces, such as Van der Waals forces. In order to securely join the active gain medium and the Q-switch by diffusion bonding or optical contact, the abutting surfaces of the active gain medium and the Q-switch must be extremely clean and flat, such as to within {fraction (1/20)} of a reference wavelength, such as 633 nanometers in one exemplary embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Both the Q-switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed of an appropriately doped host material. Typically, the host material is yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG), although materials such as yttrium vanadate (YVO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) and yttrium lithium fluoride (YLF) can be employed. In addition, while a variety of dopants can be utilized, the active gain medium is typically doped with neodymium (Nd) and the saturable absorber is typically doped with tetravalent chrome. In one advantageous embodiment, for example, the active gain medium is formed of YAG that is doped with between about 2 and about 3 atomic percent of Nd. In this embodiment, the Q-switch or saturable absorber is also formed of YAG and is doped with tetravalent chrome so as to have an optical density of 0.03 to 0.1. As will be apparent, however, the active gain medium and the saturable absorber can be doped with different atomic percentages and different types of dopant without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the active gain medium may be formed of YVO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>that is doped with thulium, such as about 5% thulium, and the saturable absorber may be formed of YVO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>that is doped with holmium, such as about 2% holmium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Regardless of the material selection, the saturable absorber serves as a Q-switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to prevent the onset of lasing until the inversion density within the microresonator is sufficiently high, i.e., above a predetermined threshold. Once lasing begins, however, the microresonator will produce a series of pulses of a predetermined wavelength, i.e., the lasing wavelength, that have a predetermined pulse width, albeit a longer pulse width than the laser pulses generated by conventional microlasers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The microresonator extends lengthwise between opposed end faces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the advantageous embodiment illustrated herein, the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is proximate one of the opposed end faces and the Q-switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is proximate the other end face. However, the active gain medium and the Q-switch can both extend lengthwise between the opposed end faces as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,219,361 entitled Side Pumped, Q-Switched Microlaser, the contents of which are incorporated in their entirety herein. The microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes first and second reflective surfaces <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> disposed proximate respective ones of the opposed end faces to define a microresonator cavity therebetween. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the first and second reflective surfaces can consist of a multi-layered dielectric coating that is deposited upon the opposed end faces. Alternatively, the first and second reflective surfaces can be formed by first and second dichroic mirrors that are positioned proximate, but slightly spaced from respective ones of the opposed end faces as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In either embodiment, the first reflective surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> proximate the end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the microresonator defined by the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a high reflectivity, such as a reflectivity of greater than 99.5%, for signals having the predetermined lasing wavelength, such as 1.064 nanometers for a microlaser having an active gain medium formed of Nd doped YAG. In addition, the second reflective surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is disposed proximate the end face of the microresonator defined by the passive Q-switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a partial reflector, typically having a reflectivity of between 40% and 90% for signals having the predetermined lasing wavelengths. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,394,413 that further describes a pair of mirrors that define the resonator cavity of a microlaser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Once the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is pumped such that the inversion density within the microresonator is above the predetermined threshold, the passive Q-switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will permit a series of pulses to be emitted. As a result of the partial reflectivity of the second reflective surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the series of pulses will then be emitted through the second reflective surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a pump source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for pumping the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with pump signals. The pump source may be configured to side pump the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via one or more side surfaces as described by U.S. Pat. No. 6,219,361 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,377,593, the context of both of which are incorporated in their entirety herein. According to one advantageous embodiment, however, the microlaser of the present invention is end pumped. In this regard, the pump source is preferably positioned such that the pump signals are delivered via the end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the microresonator as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Although the wavelength of the pump signals can be tailored to the specific materials that comprise the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an active gain medium that is comprised of Nd doped YAG is typically pumped with pump signals having a wavelength of 808&plus;/&minus;3 nanometers. In order to permit the pump signals to be received by the active gain medium without being reflected from the end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the microlaser generally includes an antireflection coating <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> deposited upon the end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through which the pump signals are introduced to permit signals having the wavelength of the pump signals to enter the microresonator cavity with little, if any, reflection. While the antireflection coating <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> deposited upon the end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be formed in a variety of manners, the antireflection coating is typically formed by the deposition of a plurality of dielectric layers having respective indices of refraction that are tailored to provide the proper reflectivity properties as known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> While the microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can include a variety of pump sources <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the microlaser of one advantageous embodiment utilizes one or more laser diodes. For example, the pump source may be a single stripe laser diode having an aperture of about 100 microns and capable of delivering 5-10 watts of pump power. The output of the pump source, such as a laser diode, may be focused onto end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a lens. Alternatively, the pump source, such as a laser diode, may be butt coupled to the end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Still further, the pump source, such as a laser diode, may be remote from the microresonator such that the output of the pump source is delivered to the end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by means of one or more optical fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Since the microresonator is typically an elongate bar having a generally rectangular cross-section (taken in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>), the microresonator also typically includes first, second, third and fourth side surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, for example, the first side surface faces upwardly, the second side surface faces downwardly, the third side surface faces the viewer and the fourth side surface faces away from the viewer and is therefore unseen. In order to prevent much, if any, light from entering or departing from the microresonator cavity via these side surfaces, the side surfaces are typically finely ground or otherwise roughened so as to diffuse light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As a result of the angled configuration of the end faces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the microresonator as described below, the resonation pattern established by the microresonator is not parallel to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as is established by conventional microlasers that have a microresonator that is a rectangular solid in shape. Instead, the resonation pattern established by the microresonator of the present invention is a zig-zag resonation pattern as shown in dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In order to support the zig-zag resonation pattern established in the microresonator cavity, the opposed end faces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the microresonator are each preferably disposed in a nonorthogonal manner relative to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> defined by the microresonator cavity. While the opposed end faces can be disposed at a variety of nonorthogonal angles relative to the longitudinal axis, the opposed end faces are typically disposed at an angle &agr; that is between about 30&deg; and about 45&deg; relative to a line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and, more commonly, at an angle &agr; of about 30.9&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The microresonator cavity is preferably constructed such that the signals undergo an integer number n of reflections or bounces from the side surfaces of the microresonator cavity prior to emission via the second reflective surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the length L<highlight><subscript>t-t </subscript></highlight>of the microresonator cavity measured tip-to-tip and the length L of a side surface are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> and can be defined as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>L</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>t-t</subscript></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>n&times;</italic></highlight>1)&plus;(2<highlight><italic>&times;s</italic></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>L</italic></highlight>&equals;(<highlight><italic>n&times;</italic></highlight>1)&minus;(2<highlight><italic>&times;s</italic></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> wherein s is the length in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of one-half of an end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As will be noted, in instances in which the opposed end faces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are parallel to one another, the length L of a side surface is identical for both the first and second side surfaces and the length L<highlight><subscript>t-t </subscript></highlight>of the microresonator cavity measured tip-to-tip is longer than either of the first and second side surfaces as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, in embodiments in which the microresonator cavity has end faces that are oriented at the same angle but in opposite directions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the length L of a side surface is the length of the shorter side surface, while the length L<highlight><subscript>t-t </subscript></highlight>measured tip-to-tip of the microresonator cavity is the length of the longer side surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Equations 1 and 2 can be rewritten in terms of other variables such as the thickness t of the microresonator cavity as measured between the first and second opposed side surfaces, the angle of incidence (AOI) of the pump signals relative to a line perpendicular to the end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the angle a of the end face as defined between the end face and the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> extending through the microresonator cavity, i.e., a&equals;90&deg;&minus;&agr;. In order to rewrite equations 1 and 2 in terms of these other variables, the length l of one bounce the signals within the microresonator cavity and the length s as measured along the longitudinal axis of one half of the end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are defined as follows:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In embodiments in which the end faces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the microresonator cavity are parallel to one another as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the signal will undergo an even number of reflections or bounces, i.e., n is an even number. Alternatively, in embodiments in which the end faces disposed at the same angle but in opposite directions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the signals will undergo an odd number of reflections or bounces within the microresonator cavity, i.e., n is an odd number. In either embodiment, the resulting microresonator cavity supports the zig-zag resonation pattern as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> By supporting a zig-zag resonation pattern within the microresonator cavity, the effective length of the resonation pattern is significant longer than the physical length of the microresonator cavity as measured along the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the effective length of the resonation pattern is defined by the path of the signals as the signals alternately bounce from the opposed side surfaces of the microresonator. For a microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is designed such that the signals reflect or bounce four times from the opposed side surfaces of the microresonator, i.e., n&equals;4, the effective length of the zig-zag resonation pattern is about three to four times longer than the physical length of the microresonator cavity as measured along the longitudinal axis. Since the length of the resonation pattern and the physical length of the resonator cavity are identical for conventional end-pumped microlasers, the microlaser of the present invention advantageously provides a much longer resonation pattern without requiring that physical dimensions of the microresonator be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As a result of the lengthened resonation pattern, the pulse width or pulse duration of the pulses output by the microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is increased relative to the pulse width of the pulses output by conventional microlasers of the same size. For example, the pulses output by the microlaser of the present invention are anticipated to have a pulse width of between 1 and 10 nanoseconds and, more typically, between about 2 and 5 nanoseconds, as compared to the pulses output by conventional end-pumped microlasers of the same size that do not support a zig-zag resonation path and which have subnanosecond pulse widths. In addition, the energy delivered by the pulses output by the microlaser of the present invention should be significantly greater than the energy delivered by the pulses output by conventional end-pumped microlasers of the same size. In this regard, pulses having an energy up to about 100 &mgr;J are anticipated to be emitted by the microlaser of the present invention in comparison to pulse energies of less than about 35 &mgr;J that are provided by the pulses output by conventional end-pumped microlasers of the same size that do not support a zig-zag resonation path. Correspondingly, the pulses emitted by the microlaser of the present invention are anticipated to have much greater average powers, such as 0.1 watts to 1 watt, than the average power of conventional end-pumped microlasers that is typically less than 0.1 watts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> While the microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention can be packaged in a variety of manners, a packaged microlaser according to one embodiment is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As shown, the microlaser further includes a heat sink <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> upon which the pump source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the microresonator are mounted. Although a variety of active and passive heat sinks can be utilized, the heat sink of one advantageous embodiment is an oxygen free high conductivity copper heat sink. Regardless of the type of heat sink, the pump source and the microresonator are preferably bonded to the heat sink by means of a thermally matched epoxy, such as an aluminum oxide filled or a silver filled epoxy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this embodiment also includes a housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in which the microresonator and the pump source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are disposed. While the housing can be comprised of a variety of materials, the housing may be comprised of a thermally conductive material and, in some embodiments, is comprised of the same material as the heat sink <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as oxygen free high conductivity copper, in order to facilitate transmission of the thermal energy to the heat sink for disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown, the housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes a window <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> aligned with and typically proximate to the second reflective surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through which pulses are output by the microresonator. The window is designed to be transmissive to signals having the predetermined lasing wavelength of the microresonator. As such, the pulses output by the microresonator will pass through the window with little, if any, attenuation. While the window can be constructed in a variety of manners, the window of one advantageous embodiment is comprised of sapphire and is coated with an antireflection coating that prevents little, if any, of the signals having the predetermined lasing wavelength from being reflected. As described above, the antireflection coating is typically formed of a plurality of dielectric layers tailored to have dielectric properties that limit, if not prevent, reflection of signals having the predetermined lasing wavelength. Although not necessary for the practice of the present invention, the microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can include a partially reflective mirror (not shown) for diverting a small fraction of each output pulse to a power monitor, such as a photodetector, that monitors the output pulses so as to provide an indication if the microlaser fails to function properly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Although the pump source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is depicted to be within the housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the pump source may be external to the housing in other embodiments. As such, the housing may include another window through which the pump signals are introduced from an external pump source. Alternatively, the pump source may be remote with the pump signals delivered via optical fibers that extend through the housing for illuminating an end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the microresonator cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is extremely advantageous in its ability to deliver pulses having longer pulse widths and greater pulse energies than the pulses delivered by conventional end-pumped microlasers of substantially the same size that do not support a zig-zag resonation path. As such, the microlaser of the present invention is advantageous for a variety of applications, including marking, micromachining, LIDAR and other ranging applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As described above, the microresonator can be fabricated in a variety of manners including epitaxially growing either the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the passive Q-switch material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> upon the other, diffusion bonding the active gain medium and the passive Q-switch or joining the active gain medium and the passive Q-switch by optical contact. In one particularly advantageous embodiment, the active gain medium is grown, such as by liquid phase epitaxy, upon the passive Q-switch material. As such, the atomic percentage of the dopant in the active gain material can be significantly greater than the atomic percentage of dopant in comparable active gain material grown according to Czochralski techniques. For example, the active gain medium of Nd doped YAG that is epitaxially grown upon a layer of tetravalent chrome doped YAG that serves as the passive Q-switch material can have an atomic percentage of Nd that is between about 2 atomic percent and 3 atomic percent, in comparison to Nd doped YAG having an atomic percentage of Nd of 0.8% to 1.4% if grown by a conventional Czochralski technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> According to this advantageous fabrication technique, a layer of passive Q-switch material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such as tetravalent chrome doped YAG is initially provided. Although the layer of passive Q-switch material can be provided in a variety of forms, the layer of passive Q-switch material is typically provided as a relatively thin wafer, which, in one embodiment, has a thickness of about 500 microns. The active gain medium <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is then grown, preferably by liquid phase epitaxy, upon the layer of the Q-switch material to form the composite structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> having opposed major surfaces <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. While the active gain medium can be grown so as to have a variety of thicknesses, the thickness of the active gain medium is typically between about 2 and 4 millimeters, and in one embodiment, is 2.2 millimeters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the composite structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is then cut into a plurality of lengthwise extending bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. While the composite structure can be cut in a variety of manners without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, the composite structure is typically mounted to a glass plate with a layer of wax. In addition, the exposed major surface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the composite structure that is opposite the glass plate is also typically coated with wax to prevent shattering of the composite structure during the cutting operation. After placing the glass plate upon a vacuum chuck, the composite structure is cut into a plurality of bars with a diamond-tipped saw. While the bars can have a variety of thicknesses, the bars of one embodiment have a thickness designated T in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> of about 1.2 millimeters. After removing the wax, each bar is laid on its side and mounted to another glass plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with an optical adhesive, such as Norland optical adhesive grade <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. After placing the glass plate upon a vacuum chuck, the bars are cut at a nonorthogonal angle &agr; relative to a line perpendicular to the opposed major surfaces to thereby form a plurality of passively Q-switched microlasers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. While the bars can be cut at a variety of angles as described above, the nonorthogonal angle &agr; is typically between about 30&deg; and 45&deg; and, more typically is about 30.9&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> After removing the optical adhesive, the first, second, third and fourth side surfaces of the respective microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be roughened, such as by finely grinding the side surfaces, to thereby diffuse light. In the embodiment in which the first and second reflective surfaces <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that define the opposed ends of the microresonator cavity are deposited upon the opposed end faces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the microresonator, the method of this advantageous embodiment also contemplates depositing the first reflective surface that is highly reflective for signals having the predetermined lasing wavelength upon one end face <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the microresonator and depositing the second reflective surface that is only partially reflective for signals having the predetermined lasing wavelength upon the other end face such that the resulting microlasers are capable of emitting signals of the predetermined lasing wavelength via the second reflective surface. As described above, the first highly reflective surface is typically deposited upon the end face proximate the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second partially reflective surface is typically deposited upon the other end face proximate the passive Q-switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As described above, the first and second reflective surfaces are typically formed by depositing a series of dielectric layers upon the opposed end faces of the microresonator that have respective indices of refraction tailored to provide the appropriate reflectivity properties in a manner known to those skilled in the art. However, the first and second reflective surfaces can be formed according to other techniques without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. While the opposed end faces of the microlaser can be coated prior to cutting the composite structure <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into a number of bars <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the opposed end faces of the microlaser are typically coated after the individual microlasers have been formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> By constructing the microlaser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the foregoing method, the active gain medium <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be more heavily doped than the active gain mediums of some conventional microlasers that are grown according to a Czochralski technique. As such, the output pulses provided by the resulting microlaser can have pulse energies and power levels that are even further increased relative to the output pulses provided by conventional microlasers. As described in detail above, the microlasers of the present invention that are fabricated according to the foregoing method or that are fabricated in other manners, such as by diffusion bonding, are also particularly advantageous since the microlasers provide output pulses having a greater pulse width or pulse duration and greater pulse energies and average power levels as a result of the zig-zag resonation pattern supported by the microresonator in comparison to conventional end-pumped microlasers of substantially the same physical size that do not support a zig-zag resonation pattern. As such, the resulting microlaser of the present invention is particularly advantageous for a wide variety of applications that are demand output pulses having increased energy levels, average power levels and pulse durations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. </paragraph>
