<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to the field of temperature control and more particularly to an improved apparatus and method of providing temperature control to electronic devices using power following feedback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to temperature control systems which maintain the temperature of an electronic device at or near a constant set point temperature while the device is being operated or tested. Two examples of electronic devices which are best operated at a constant or near constant temperature are packaged integrated chips and bare chips which are unpackaged. Maintaining the chip temperature near a constant set point is not difficult if the power dissipation of the chip is constant or varies in a small range while operating or testing. One way of handling such a situation is to couple the chip through a fixed thermal resistance to a thermal mass which is at a fixed temperature. But if the instantaneous power dissipation of the chip varies up and down in a wide range while operating or testing, then maintaining the chip temperature near a constant set point is very difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Various temperature forcing systems are used to respond to the chip&apos;s temperature variation caused by widely varying power dissipation of the chip. Feedback methods are commonly used to sense the varying temperature. Typical approaches involve the use of a temperature sensing device such as a thermocouple, mounted on the chip package or chip itself. Another approach is to integrate a temperature sensing device, such as a thermal diode, into the chip circuitry. Such a temperature sensing device would be used to sense changes in the chip&apos;s temperature, and then adjust the temperature forcing system appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There are several problems with the use of temperature sensing devices. In the case of packaged chips, an externally mounted thermocouple will indicate the temperature of the package surface, not the temperature of the chip inside the package. At some level of power dissipation, this temperature difference will be significant to the test result. The use of temperature sensors integrated into the chip itself addresses this problem, but raises other issues. It is not typical practice for the chip manufacturer to integrate temperature sensors on the chip. Even if it were, each chip&apos;s temperature sensor would have unique calibration requirements. All of the above present problems for high volume chip manufacturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Temporary temperature sensors, such as thermocouple probes, included in automated test handling equipment can address some of these issues. However, the package temperature vs. die temperature problem will remain. Also, the reliability of the temporary temperature sensor introduces error which can be significant to the high volume chip manufacturing test result. Moreover, the surface available for temperature control is the same surface needed for the temporary temperature sensor, complicating the problem further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a need has arisen for an apparatus and method of temperature control for electronic devices which can respond to the temperature of the electronic device, instead of the package. A further need exists for an apparatus and method of temperature control for electronic devices which can conveniently be used for high volume chip manufacturing. A further need exists for an apparatus and method of temperature control for electronic devices which is reliable. A further need exists for an apparatus and method of temperature control for electronic device which does not require significant surface area of the electronic device. A further need exists for a method of temperature control for electronic devices which does not require temperature sensing devices to be integrated into the chip or to be temporarily in contact with the chip. A further need exists for a method of temperature control for electronic devices which does not require collecting, maintaining, and applying the use of chip power profiles, and does not require the capability of performing such tasks in the automated test equipment, temperature forcing system, and testing software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcoming or at least reducing the effects of one or more of the problems set out above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The above-noted and other aspects of the present invention will become more apparent from a description of an embodiment, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. The drawings illustrate an embodiment of the invention. In the drawings, the same members have the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Pending patent application U.S. Ser. No. 08/734,212 to Pelissier, assigned to the present assignee, is hereby incorporated as fully set forth herein. Co-pending provisional patent application U.S. S. No. 60/092,715 to Jones et al. (attorney docket number 42811-002.884235.1 106), also assigned to the present assignee, filed on Jul. 14, 1998, is also hereby incorporated as if fully set forth herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 1. Central Principles </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When a device is tested, the tests need to be run at a specified temperature, known as a set point. The device, which is also called the device under test (&ldquo;DUT&rdquo;), is typically tested at several different set points and the performance at each set point is noted. The performance of the DUT is often measured as the maximum operating frequency, f<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>, at a given set point. A DUT is typically faster (high f<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>) at lower temperatures and slower (low f<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>) at higher temperatures. A higher f<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>indicates a better performing DUT and, therefore, a more valuable DUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It has become increasingly difficult to maintain a given set point. One of the reasons is the DUT self-heating which occurs during a test. The DUT self-heats because it draws power during the test. If the DUT cannot be maintained at the set point during a test sequence, and it heats up, then, as indicated above, the performance of the DUT will go down. This results in underreporting the DUT&apos;s performance because if the temperature had been kept at the desired, lower temperature, then the performance would have been better. The same device could then have been sold at a higher price. The price is typically exponentially higher for a faster device. Thus, the impact is large for manufacturers who must, understandably, accept the underreported performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The number of devices affected is also exponentially related to the temperature increase from self-heating. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> indicates, the distribution of the performance of a given lot of devices typically has a normal distribution about some center frequency. That center frequency is approximately 450 MHz in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, for the right-most curve. In this example, the high performing devices are considered to be those with an f<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>of 480 MHz or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> If the set point can be maintained, then all of the devices of the right-most curve which are in the tail to the right of 480 MHz will be high performing devices. However, if the set point cannot be maintained due to self-heating, then the curve will shift, resulting in the left-most curve, for example. In this example, the actual junction temperature of the device is assumed to increase by 20 degrees C., which would result in approximately a 4% decrease in performance. The distribution of devices in this lot is therefore shifted to the left, so that it is centered around approximately 432 MHz (4% of 450&equals;18). This shifted curve is represented by the left-most curve. However, a high performing device still needs to have an f<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>of 480 MHz or greater. The high performance area of the curve has thus moved further into the tail of the distribution. As is clear from the area under the curve, the number of high performance devices is now exponentially smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> This problem would continue to get worse. Industry trends are toward devices which operate at greater frequencies and occupy less area. This causes the devices to use more power, have greater power spikes or transitions, and to be less able to dissipate the heat which they generate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Many semiconductors utilize complementary metal oxide semiconductor (&ldquo;CMOS&rdquo;) technology. One of the characteristics of CMOS is that it draws a large spike in power when it switches states. Further, as a CMOS device is operated at a faster speed, the device will typically switch more quickly and more often. This will require more power and will also result in large, fast changes in instantaneous power consumption. Thus, more heat will be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> This situation is aggravated by the decreasing size and thermal mass of the devices. This results in less &ldquo;space&rdquo; into which the heat of the device can dissipate or diffuse. The net result will be larger variations in DUT temperature due to self-heating and increased underreporting of DUT performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Convection systems have proven ineffective, as have improvements to them. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is shown the performance of a forced air system when analyzed in terms of junction temperature in a device and power drawn by the device. The deviation in the junction temperature from the desired set point increases as the power drawn by the device increases. As can be seen, the deviation exceeds twenty degrees C. at several transition points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Conduction systems, while offering a potential advantage over convection systems, have also proven ineffective. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, there is shown the performance of simple conduction on a flip chip device. As the power drawn by the device increases, the temperature also increases well in excess of the nominal temperature of approximately sixty degrees C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A true solution requires an ability to quickly detect a DUT&apos;s temperature and an ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in the DUT temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As described in this application, both requirements are addressed by the disclosed invention. They provide a mechanism for quickly determining the DUT temperature by using a newly developed power-following feedback technique. The disclosures also provide a heat source/sink (generically, a heat exchanger (&ldquo;Hx&rdquo;)) that can respond quickly and effectively to offset the self-heating of the DUT. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is shown a reduced overshoot in the DUT temperature effected in part by the rapid response to the determined DUT temperature. This response is shown by the heat exchanger temperature reflecting, with a reverse image, the power to the DUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The power-following feedback method which is used for determining the DUT temperature also has the advantage of working in real time, so that test sequences can be optimized without the need for changing thermal conditioning, and without the thermal conditioning limiting test program flexibility. A key feature is the development and use of a simplified equation which allows the derivation of a DUT temperature from the power measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> While a measurement, also called a calculation, of the total power usage of a DUT is desirable, it will be clear to those skilled in the relevant art, in light of the present disclosure, that this will not always be necessary. Clearly, there will be embodiments in which part of the power could be estimated or ignored. This may occur, for example and without limitation, if all of a device&apos;s power fluctuations are isolated to a particular voltage or power supply, or if a particular power supply provides a comparatively small amount of power to the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Further, monitoring the power supplies is a convenient method of monitoring power usage because the connections are removed from the DUT and because it senses the instantaneous power fluctuations before the actual change in self-heating occurs. Note that these power fluctuations may be increases or decreases and may give rise to increases or decreases in self-heating. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are other methods of monitoring power, current, and/or voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> 2. Power Following System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention. A monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> monitors power usage from one or more power supplies <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which supply power to an electronic device (not shown) under test or in operation. If there is a plurality of power supplies <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, then the monitor circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sums the total power usage. An electrical connection point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> links the monitor circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to each power supply <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The electrical connection point <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides the monitor circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with indication of the power usage of the electronic device, such as a voltage image of the current through the electronic device and a voltage level at which the electronic device is being operated or tested. Electrical connection points <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are available in power supplies of automated test equipment used to test electronic devices. The monitor circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sends a power usage signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (a voltage representing the value of the power usage) to a thermal control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Based on a given chip set point temperature or a signal representing the set point temperature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a forcing system surface temperature or a signal representing the forcing system surface temperature <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the thermal control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> translates the power usage signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into a temperature control signal <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The thermal control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> sends the temperature control signal <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to a heat exchanger temperature control <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The heat exchanger temperature control <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> contains a heat exchanger power supply (not shown) with a power amplifier and controls temperature to a heat exchanger <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> for the electronic device under test or operation by adjusting the output current of the heat exchanger power supply. The resulting temperature of the heat exchanger is the forcing system surface temperature <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the thermal control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> resides on a thermal control board <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The thermal control board <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> also contains, among other components, a first precise constant current source <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a second precise constant current source <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The first precise constant current source <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> sends a precise constant current from the thermal control board <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to a variable resistance device (&ldquo;RTD&rdquo;) in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The RTD responds to the forcing system surface temperature and outputs a voltage representing the forcing system surface temperature <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The forcing system surface temperature voltage <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> feeds back into the thermal control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Placing the first precise constant current source <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> off of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> provides an advantage in that the heat exchanger can be replaced more easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The second precise constant current source <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is able to send a precise constant current to the DUT. The heat exchanger <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is further described in the section on the Temperature Control Unit below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be used in conjunction with the techniques and apparatus described in co-pending provisional patent application U.S. S. No. 60/092,715 to Jones et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As one skilled in the relevant art will readily appreciate, in light of the present and incorporated disclosures, the functions of the overall system can be implemented with a variety of techniques. Electrical circuits are disclosed herein for the monitoring circuit and the thermal control circuit, but other implementations are possible for these functions, as well as for others such as producing the signals representing the current, voltage, temperature, and power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the functionality disclosed herein can be implemented by hardware, software, and/or a combination of both. Software implementations can be written in any suitable language, including without limitation high-level programming languages such as C&plus;&plus;, mid-level and low-level languages, assembly languages, and application-specific or device-specific languages. Such software can run on a general purpose computer such as a 486 or a Pentium, an application specific piece of hardware, or other suitable device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In addition to using discrete hardware components in a logic circuit, the required logic may also be performed by an application specific integrated circuit (&ldquo;ASIC&rdquo;) or other device. The technique may use analog circuitry, digital circuitry, or a combination of both. The system will also include various hardware components which are well known in the art, such as connectors, cables, and the like. Moreover, at least part of this functionality may be embodied in computer readable media (also referred to as computer program products), such as magnetic, magnetic-optical, and optical media, used in programming an information-processing apparatus to perform in accordance with the invention. This functionality also may be embodied in computer readable media, or computer program products, such as a transmitted waveform to be used in transmitting the information or functionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Further, the present disclosure should make it clear to one skilled in the art that the present invention can be applied to a variety of different fields, applications, industries, and technologies. The present invention can be used, without limitation, with any powered system in which temperature must either be monitored or controlled. This includes without limitation many different processes and applications involved in semiconductor fabrication, testing, and operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the preferred embodiment calculates, or monitors, the power which is supplied to a DUT from a power supply. This power is typically provided to a power plane or grid of some sort on the DUT, through one or more power connections in the DUT. This is to be differentiated from the power inherent in any signal. Clearly, any signal connection on a device is designed to receive the specified power of that signal, for example a clock signal. However, the power which the preferred embodiment monitors is the power provided from a power supply to the power connections, and not the power inherent in a signal which might be supplied to a signal connection. A power supply, as used above, refers to a standard industry device which can supply electrical power at a specified voltage for operating a device. It should be clear, however, that the techniques of the present invention could be applied to any signal, including without limitation a power signal, a clock signal, and a data signal. These techniques could also be applied to nonstandard power supplies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> 3. The Monitoring Circuit Summing Function </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating the calculating function of the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an embodiment of the present invention where the electronic device is supplied power from a plurality of power devices <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Each electrical connection <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) sends current <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and voltage signals <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> from its corresponding power supply <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) to the monitor circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Each current and voltage signal <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> passes through a respective first amplifier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, where it is amplified and into a low pass filter <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> which removes wide-band noise and high frequency components of the signal. The current and voltage signals <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> may be in the form of voltages representing the values of the respective current or voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The thermal components of the system respond more slowly (e.g. milliseconds) than does the power supplied to the electronic device under test (e.g. nanoseconds). Accordingly, the high frequency components of the current and voltage signals <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> add no value. Removing the high frequency components of the current and voltage signals <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> matches the bandwidth of the current and voltage signals <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> to the bandwidth of the rest of the control circuit and simplifies the task of stabilizing the temperature control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The current and voltage signals <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> for a particular power supply then pass together into a first multiplying circuit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, which uses the current and voltage signals <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> to calculate power usage for that particular power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For every power supply, the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> uses the following equation to calculate the power usage from the current and voltage signals <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>P&equals;I*V</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Eqn. 1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Where: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> P&equals;power usage in watts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> I current signal in amps </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> V voltage signal in volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If the power supply <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provides a voltage image of the current being drawn by the electronic device, then a scaling factor is required which describes the volts-to-amps relationship of the voltage image signal. If the electronic device is being tested, the scaling factor is derived from characteristics of the power supply to the automatic test equipment (also powering the electronic device under operation or test) being used to test the electronic device. For example, the scaling factor of Schlumberger&apos;s VHCDPS is 1.0, while the scaling factor of Schlumberger&apos;s HCDPS is 0.87. The scaling factor is made available to the monitoring circuit to allow the conversion of the signal in volts to a corresponding current value in amps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The scaling factor can also be determined empirically with the formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Scaling factor&equals;Signal Volts/Measured Amps. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> This could be done by measuring the actual current and the signal voltage simultaneously, and then dividing the voltage by the measured amperage. Certain embodiments may also allow the setting of one or more specific current outputs and then measuring the signal voltage(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The output from all the first multiplying circuits <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> pass into a single summing circuit <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, which sums the power usage from all of the power supplies into the power usage signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The power usage signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be in the form of a voltage representing that value and passes through a second amplifier <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> before leaving the monitoring circuit and going on to the thermal control circuit as the power usage signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> 4. The Thermal Control Circuit </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating the thermal control circuit of the present invention. The temperature of the electronic device being tested or under operation can be determined using the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Chip temperature&equals;<highlight><italic>K</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>theta</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*P</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>ed</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>fss</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Eqn. 2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Where: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Chip temperature (&deg; C.) represents the chip temperature derived from its power dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>is a constant (&deg; C./watts) derived from the capabilities of the temperature forcing system and the thermal resistance of the medium (or media, in those cases where heat spreaders, lids, or other devices are attached to the top of the device itself) between the electronic device and the heat exchanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> P<highlight><subscript>ed </subscript></highlight>(watts) is the total power usage, reflected in the power usage signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> obtained from the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> T<highlight><subscript>fss </subscript></highlight>(&deg; C.) is the system surface forcing temperature and is the absolute temperature of the medium contacting the chip, as measured by a temperature sensor embedded in the thermal control system surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>is also derived from the general efficiency of the thermal control system when in contact with the DUT. For example, at setpoint temperatures well above ambient, the DUT loses proportionally more heat to its surroundings, and the thermal control system must work harder to raise DUT temperature than to lower it. From the standpoint of a thermal control system responding to DUT self-heating, the overall effect is the same as a lower thermal resistance between the DUT and the heat exchanger operating at an ambient setpoint. Similarly, at setpoint temperatures well below ambient, the DUT gains heat from its surroundings, and the thermal control system must work harder to lower temperature than to raise it. From the standpoint of a thermal control system responding to DUT self-heating, the overall effect is the same as a higher thermal resistance between the DUT and the heat exchanger operating at an ambient setpoint. In both cases, K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>is adjusted to reflect the effect of heat transfer to the DUT&apos;s surrounding environment during power excursions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>may be considered an effective or a fine-tuned thermal resistance of the medium. Although the thermal resistance of different media are set out in standard chemistry reference books (such as <highlight><italic>CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, </italic></highlight>77th Edition; David R. Lide, Editor-in-Chief), factors such as ambient humidity, pressure, and temperature may affect the actual thermal resistance. Thermal resistance may also be affected by the physical configuration of the test. To determine K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>one can use a calibration process to adjust the value of the anticipated thermal resistance of the medium and ascertain whether the result is an improvement. Another advantage of a calibration process is that it will automatically account for the &ldquo;efficiency factor&rdquo; of the heat transfer from the DUT to the thermal control system as a function of the setpoint temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As described above, K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>offers the advantage of incorporating the effects of a variety of variables into one term. In the preferred embodiment, K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>only needs to be optimized for a given application, or type of DUT, and then can be used to test many different devices of the same type. Additionally, one practical effect of K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>is that in mirroring the monitored power consumption of the device with the temperature of the temperature forcing system (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>magnifies or compresses the relative magnitude of the mirroring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the thermal summing circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the temperature control signal <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is determined using the following equation: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Where: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> V<highlight><subscript>tcs </subscript></highlight>is the temperature control signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> V<highlight><subscript>sp </subscript></highlight>is a set point temperature voltage <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight>, a voltage representing the set point temperature for the electronic device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> V<highlight><subscript>k-theta </subscript></highlight>is a voltage <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> representing the K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>value. The K<highlight><subscript>theta </subscript></highlight>value is inputted into a digital to analog converter, which generates a voltage corresponding to the value of the input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> V<highlight><subscript>Ped </subscript></highlight>is the total power usage signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> obtained from the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) and which represents the watts consumed by the DUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> V<highlight><subscript>fsst </subscript></highlight>is the forcing system surface temperature voltage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> generated by digital to analog conversion and representing the forcing system surface temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> V<highlight><subscript>IRO </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> is a voltage generated by digital to analog conversion which represents a voltage equal to the value of the precise constant current from the first precise constant current source <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the thermal control board <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> multiplied by the resistance shown by the variable resistance device in the heat exchanger at 0 degrees C. This can be determined when the embedded temperature sensor in the heat exchanger is calibrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> V<highlight><subscript>alpha </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is a voltage generated by digital to analog conversion and represented the slope of a curve for the variable resistance device in the heat exchanger of resistance versus temperature. This can be determined when the embedded temperature sensor in the heat exchanger is calibrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the power usage signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) enters the thermal control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by passing through a third amplifier <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. From there, the power usage signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> passes into a second multiplying circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> where it is multiplied with a V<highlight><subscript>k-theta </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> to create a first modified signal. The modified power usage signal then passes into a fourth amplifier <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> and from there into a thermal summing circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The voltage representing forcing system surface temperature V<highlight><subscript>fsst </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also enters the thermal control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by passing through a fifth amplifier <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. From there, V<highlight><subscript>fsst </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> passes into a subtracting circuit <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> where V<highlight><subscript>IRO </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> is subtracted from V<highlight><subscript>fsst </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for a calibrated V<highlight><subscript>fsst</subscript></highlight>. The calibrated V<highlight><subscript>fsst </subscript></highlight>passes through a sixth amplifier <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and into a divisional circuit <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, where the calibrated V<highlight><subscript>fsst </subscript></highlight>is divided by V<highlight><subscript>alpha </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. A result representing (V<highlight><subscript>fsst</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>IRO</subscript></highlight>)/V<highlight><subscript>alpha</subscript></highlight>) passes through a seventh amplifier <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> and from there passes into the thermal summing circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and is summed there with the modified power usage signal to yield a summation. The summation passes into a difference circuit (or subtraction circuit) <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight>, which subtracts the summation from the set point temperature voltage <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> to yield a resulting signal. This signal represents the instantaneous temperature error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The resulting signal passes into a derivative circuit <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> which takes the derivative of the resulting circuit with respect to time and smoothes it out. The derivative signal is amplified by a sixth amplifier <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> before leaving the thermal control circuit as the temperature control signal V<highlight><subscript>tcs </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The derivative circuit <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> represents the overall control section of the thermal control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. This is where the circuit&apos;s response time to instantaneous signal level changes is determined. Although characterized by the derivative circuit <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, the control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be described as a PI style control loop because there is a proportional and integral gain stage in the control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments may use true PID control by, for example, either designing a custom system or using an off the shelf commercial servo controller. Such a system adds capabilities like continuous ramping, s-curve profiling, servo tuning for minimal overshoot and undershoot, and improved closed-loop control stability. Depending upon the particular controller used, the PID controller may need to convert the temperature signals and the power signal to some sort of thermal position signal, and feed it back into a commercial servomotor controller. Some controllers may also need to do some conversion on the back end. As these examples indicate, the control functions required can be performed by analog and/or digital circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> 5. Graphic Example </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating an example of the power following temperature control of the present invention. The graph illustrates that the temperature of the electronic device <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> can be kept fairly constant even with wider swings in the amount of power <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> used by the electronic device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> 6. Test Control and Temperature Determination </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As described in the disclosure, a control system maintains the DUT temperature at a specified set point within a given tolerance. The control system must therefore have some information on the DUT temperature. Some control systems, such as direct temperature following, require repeated DUT temperature information. Other control systems, such as power following, which control deviation from a set point, do not need repeated DUT temperature information but only need to know when to begin the temperature maintenance process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the power following process begins after the DUT has reached the set point temperature. This information may be determined indirectly, for example, after a soak timer has expired. It may also be determined directly, for example, by monitoring a thermal structure. Thermal structures can be used to supply initial DUT temperature information and they can also be monitored throughout the test if they are properly calibrated. One embodiment of the present invention monitors thermal structures to determine the initial DUT temperature before initiating a power following temperature control method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the characterization and validation process is performed for the power following temperature control of a particular type of DUT. This process utilizes die temperature information. If a statistically relevant sample set is taken with true die temperature information during the calibration process, then no temperature sensing device in the die is necessary during high volume manufacturing and testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention may include separate control sections to control the temperature and to control the test sequence. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, there is shown a generic high-level block diagram illustrating a test control system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and temperature control system <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, both of which are connected to and communicate with a DUT <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. This disclosure has been primarily concerned with describing the temperature control system <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The test control system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> would operate the appropriate tests on the DUT <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> while the temperature control system <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> controlled the DUT temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> These two control systems <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> need to communicate or otherwise coordinate their activities. Either the temperature control system <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> or the test control system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can monitor a thermal structure.

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> 7. Data Acquisition </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The information which the above-described power following system utilizes is information on the power draw of a DUT. In one described embodiment, this information is the scaled voltage image of current and voltage signals, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. These signals are supplied by the power supply(s) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. This information can also be made available for other purposes, with a data generation system. Such a data generation system may display the power information such as with plots or graphs, perform calculations based on it for a variety of applications, monitor performance or efficiency, and store the data, to name a few of the possibilities. Various data generation systems are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, there is shown a power supply <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> supplying power to a DUT <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The power supply is preferably a programmable power supply. There is also shown a data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, more generally referred to as a data acquisition device, which receives power information, such as the scaled voltage images of the current and voltage signals from the power supply <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In certain embodiments, the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> can receive the same information that the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> receives. That signal (connecting the power supply <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through connection <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) can be supplied to the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in a variety of methods known in the industry, including without limitation, splitting the line, or daisy-chaining the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>C, the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably disposed between the power supply <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> then receives the power use signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the monitoring circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> acquires the power use signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> directly instead of having to either perform the calculations itself or rely on another device or processor to perform them. Various power usage signals <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, scaled voltage images of the power, are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> (Chip Power), <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (Actual Pwr), <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> (Power Mon), and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> (Power to DUT). In these figures, the signals were acquired by data acquisition cards <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may utilize analog and/or digital circuitry. Preferably the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> contains an analog-to-digital converter with multiple channels. One embodiment uses an off-the-shelf board, model number PCI-6031E made by National Instruments, for the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may also perform a variety of control functions, such as setting the sampling rate and other parameters. In a preferred embodiment, however, the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> sends the data to another controller. In each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 10C</cross-reference>, there is shown a general purpose personal computer (&ldquo;PC&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> which serves as the controller and sets a variety of values on the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the PC <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> receives digitized data from the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the PC <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can then perform a variety of services and functions with the data. In one embodiment, the data can be stored on a digital storage medium such as, for example, a hard disk, floppy disk, optical disk, ZIP disk, or Bernoulli drive. The data can also be transmitted, displayed on a display device such as a computer screen, or processed. Other embodiments may also encompass additional processors or equipment, including analog equipment, which utilize the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the PC <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> includes a Pentium processor and uses the Windows NT operating system. Various communications cards and protocols can be used between the PC <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, including without limitation, a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (&ldquo;UART&rdquo;), a universal receiver transmitter (&ldquo;URT&rdquo;), and the RS-232 standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the data acquisition card <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> also acquires various other information, including without limitation, DUT temperature information, heat exchanger power information, coolant flow rates, and fluid inlet and outlet temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> 8. Temperature Control Unit </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a general diagram of a system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. As shown, the user operates the system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at the operator interface panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The operator interface panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> serves as an interface to the system controller <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The system controller <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is housed in the thermal control chassis <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and controls the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the liquid cooling and recirculation system <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The heat exchanger <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> preferably includes a heater and a heat sink. Other heat exchangers are possible, however. The heat sink preferably contains a chamber through which the liquid is pumped. Other heat sinks are also possible. Heat sinks, or heat sink systems, with no liquid are also viable if the thermal conductivity is high enough. In particular, solid heat sinks such as Peltier devices are known in the art which use electrical signals through the material to control temperature and temperature gradients. A heat sink may also be equivalently referred to as a heat transfer unit, thus focusing attention on the fact that the heat sink may also act as a heat source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The heater of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is preferably a three layer co-fired aluminum nitride heater substrate with a heater trace between the first two layers and the RTD trace between the last two layers. The heater trace provides the heating and the RTD trace provides temperature information. The two traces are electrically isolated while being at essentially the same thermal position due to the thermal conductivity of the aluminum nitride layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In discussing the temperature of a heater, or heat sink or other device, it is to be understood that the temperature of a single point on the device is being discussed. This follows from the fact that a typical heater, or heat sink or other device, will have a temperature gradient across the surface. In the case of a heater, the existence of a gradient is due, in part, to the fact that the heating element usually occupies only a portion of the heater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The liquid cooling and recirculation system <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> supplies a liquid to the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, specifically to the heat sink, through the boom arm <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The boom arm <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> also carries the control signals from the system controller <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the heater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A test head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is adapted to be positioned under the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The test head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> preferably contains a test socket which is used for mating with a device under test (&ldquo;DUT&rdquo;) such as a chip. Testing of the DUT can then be performed through the test head <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the temperature of the DUT can also be regulated during the testing. During temperature regulation the DUT is preferably in conductive contact with the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> 9. Modifications and Benefits </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention can include a time delay or filtering on the power usage signal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or elsewhere, to adjust the effect of power compensation with respect to time. This might be used, for example, to offset the effects of a big ceramic substrate or other large thermal heat sink, or to average out the effects of a high frequency power signal without eliminating them. A time delay or filter would become more important as testers and microprocessors become faster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments may also compensate for large bypass capacitance on a tester interface board or a DUT itself. Bypass capacitance is used to supply instantaneous charge which the power supply cannot replenish fast enough, due to inductive loading or physical distance. As the bypass capacitance increases, the time between the power supply signal and the DUT self-heating will decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> While the embodiment described above uses analog design techniques, a digital signal processor and software could be used in an alternative embodiment of the invention to effect this digitally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The benefits of the present invention include providing an apparatus and method of temperature control for electronic devices which can respond to the temperature of the electronic device, instead of the package. A further benefit of the present invention is that it provides an apparatus and method of temperature control for electronic devices which can conveniently be used for high volume chip manufacturing. A further benefit of the present invention is that it provides an apparatus and method of temperature control for electronic devices which is reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> A further benefit of the present invention is that it provides an apparatus and method of temperature control for electronic device which does not require significant surface area of the electronic device for sensing the device temperature, although the system does require surface area for conduction. Another benefit of the present invention is that it eliminates the need for temperature sensing devices to be integrated into the chip or to be temporarily connected to the chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Yet another benefit is that the present invention also eliminates the need to collect, maintain, and apply the use of chip power profiles, as well as eliminating the need for the capability in the automated test equipment, temperature forcing system and testing software to collect and apply chip power profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The principles, preferred embodiments, and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification. The invention is not to be construed as limited to the particular forms disclosed, because these are regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Moreover, variations and changes may be made by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
