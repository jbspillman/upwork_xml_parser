<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to molding processes and articles molded thereby and, more particularly to an improved molding process in which decorative films are formed with the forming of the article to enhance the cosmetic appearance thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Injection molding is used widely to produce numerous articles. These articles range from articles with simple configuration such as plates, light switches and the like to more complex molded shapes, such as wireless telephone housings. These molded articles often need to be decorated to enhance their visual appeal and their saleability. Some such articles may be decorated in the simplest sense of the term, by either adding pigments to the pellets of plastic used int he injection molding process or by using colored pellets to mold the article. Although these two methods are effective for coloring the molded article, they result in solid coloring of the article and are ineffective in forming any complex decorative appearance to the molded article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Some other processes are known in the injection molding art for decorating molded products. One such process involves the use of stamping or otherwise applying a foil layer to the exterior of the molded product. In this process, the foil is applied to the molded article after the article is molded and ejected from the molding machine. This metal foil is thin and is prone to breakage on sharp corners-and complex curves of the molded article. Registration problems are also encountered with this process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another process for decorating molded articles involves the use of &ldquo;pad&rdquo; printing in which colors or designs are applied to the molded article after molding, by way of one or some more printing pads. These pads are formed of foam rubber or other pliable material and have one or more inks deposited on their exterior surfaces, which are subsequently applied to the molded article. Problems exist in that the pad may not contact all the intended surfaces of the article and thus may not accurately apply the ink(s) to all surfaces, especially complex surfaces of the molded article. Similarly, the exterior surface of a molded article may serve to frustrate the use of screen printing the molded article. Hydrographics, the use of floating a decal in water and then applying it to the molded article, has its own limitations in that the decals are prone to tearing and there exist great difficulties in accurately registering the decals in place on a complex molded article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In-mold decorating is yet another process that has been used to decorate injection molded articles. This process involves introducing a decorative film into the mold cavity. However, the film is delicate and fragile. It also has registration problems with complex molded articles inasmuch as the film inserted into the mold cavity is die cut. The walls and surfaces of the mold cavity are used for registration of the film in the mold cavity, and the mold cavity may not be modified to create any registration means. As such, this process is effectively limited to application to flat surfaces in the mold and on the final molded article, such as label recesses. It also cannot provide any details along the z-axis of the mold cavity or along the sides of the finished molded article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A still further process involves the use of a decorative &ldquo;preform&rdquo;, where an outer, decorative shell is formed complying to the configuration of the final molded article and it is inserted into the mold cavity prior to the injection of liquid plastic or other molding material into the mold cavity. The shape of this preform must conform accurately to the final configuration of the molded article. Where openings are molded into the article during the molding process, registration between the preform and the mold cavity must be critically maintained. Thin wall portions of the preform may result in leakage of the injected melt and problems with the finished article, leading to high rejection rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The process cannot accommodate the application of a fabric to a molded surface. A need therefore exists for an improved molding process for decorating the surfaces of a molded article that complements the usual operational parameters of the molding process and which overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages of the prior art. The present invention provides an improved injection molding process in which fabric may be applied to a molded article during the injection cycle of the molding process. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention is therefore directed to a molding process in which a decorative film is applied to the exterior surface of a molded article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide an improved molding process in which a decorative film is formed onto the exterior surface of a molded article during the actual molding thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a hybrid injection molding process in which a decorative film is first prepared and subsequently intimately attached to a molded article by drawing the decorative film into a mold cavity, injecting a liquid melt into the mold cavity so that an intimate attachment results between the molded article and its associated decorative film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved molding process in which a film sheet is decorated with a preselected decorative pattern is applied in registration with a mold cavity, the film sheet is heated and drawn into the mold cavity by negative air pressure so that the film sheet is in contact with substantially all of the mold cavity interior surfaces, and a liquid melt, typically a liquid plastic, is injected into the mold cavity so that it entirely fills the mold cavity and contacts the film sheet so that when the liquid melt is cooled and the article is ejected from the mold cavity, the film sheet is intimately attached to the molded article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a molding process for forming decorative molded articles that includes the following steps: modifying a mold cavity, preferably the core side, to include registration means for maintaining a decorative film sheet in registration with the mold core cavity; applying the decorative film sheet to the mold core cavity; softening the decorative film sheet; applying negative air pressure to at least a portion of the mold core cavity to drawn the decorative film into the mold core cavity and at least into partial contact with the surfaces of the mold core cavity; bringing an opposing mold detail member into engagement with the mold core to form a final mold cavity; and, injecting a liquid molding compound into the mold cavity under pressure to form a molded article, the decorative film sheet being bonded to the molded article along substantially all of the exterior surfaces of the molded article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to provide a molding machine for performing a hybrid molding process in which a decorative film sheet is drawn into one of two coacting mold blocks in order to contact the interior surface of the one mold block, and a heated molding compound is injected under pressure into the mold cavity so that the decorative film sheet becomes bonded to the molded article, the molding machine having means for holding the film in place over one of the two mold blocks and in registration with the mold cavity of the one mold block, the machine further having means for drawing the decorative film sheet into the one mold block through the cavity of the one mold block and means for maintaining the film sheet in place during injection of molding material into the mold cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A yet still further object of the present invention is to provide a unique molded article having a body portion and an exterior decorative portion, the two portions of the molded article being intimately attached to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a decorative sheet for insertion into a mold cavity and subsequent attachment thereof to a molded article during the molding of the article, the sheet having a decorative area defined thereon that includes a decorative pattern for attachment to the molded article, the decorative area being printed, painted or otherwise formed, the decorative area having a surface area that is generally no smaller than a corresponding surface area of the mold cavity, the decorative sheet including means for registering the sheet and the decorative area in alignment with the mold cavity, the decorative sheet registration means engaging a complementary registration means formed on one of the mold blocks of the molding machine, preferably the mold cavity or core block, and the decorative sheet further having a flat profile so that it can be easily interposed and held in place between the two molding blocks of the molding machine during the molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an injection molding machine that is adapted for hybrid molding in which a film is inserted into the mold cavity, as part of the injection molding process, the molding machine having at least two opposing mold blocks, one of the two mold blocks including a mold core portion and the other of the two mold blocks including a mold detail portion, the molding machine further including a member that is selectively interposed between the two mold blocks to, in essence, &ldquo;capture&rdquo; a film sheet therebetween, the captive member and at least one of the two mold blocks having cooperating means for registering the film sheet with the one mold block, one of the two mold blocks including a porous insert that forms a portion of the mold cavity, the porosity of the insert enabling negative air pressure to be applied thereto so that a portion of the film sheet may be drawn into the mold cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved molding process in which a fabric or other textile material is applied to the exterior surface of the molded article and is intimately attached to the exterior surface of the molded article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for injection molding a plastic article and bonding a fabric to a surface of the article during molding, the process including the steps of providing opposing mold core and cavity members, each of the core and cavity members having a porous portion through which gases may pass but not the injected molding material, positioning a fabric sheet over the cavity member, drawing a vacuum in the mold cavity by applying negative air pressure to the mold cavity porous position, applying positive air pressure to the mold core porous position and directing it to a second side of the fabric sheet to thereby assist the drawing of the fabric sheet into the mold cavity, and subsequently injecting a molding material into the mold cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide an injection molding machine for molding parts with a fabric intimately applied to the part, the machine including a pair of opposing mold members, one of the members including a cavity portion and the other of the members including a core portion that extends into the cavity portion when the two members are brought together; each of the mold core and cavity members including at least one porous portion through which gases can pass but not the injected material; a means for applying negative air pressure communicating with the mold cavity member; a means for communicating positive air pressure with the mold core member and a means for positioning a fabric sheet along the parting line between the mold members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the invention are enabled by the unique steps set out in the methods of the present invention and by the novel structure of certain aspects of the equipment used in methods of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As exemplified by one embodiment of the invention, a molding machine that has two mold coacting mold blocks, one mold block providing a mold core and the other mold block providing a mold core detail, is modified to accept a decorative film sheet in place over one of the mold blocks, preferably that providing the mold core. The mold core block has means for registering the decorative film sheet in a preselected position between the two mold blocks, such as a plurality of raised pins extending axially outwardly from the outer surface of the mold core block. These registration pins are disposed outside the perimeter of the mold core so that a placement mechanism may be used to apply the film sheet to the mold core block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The placement mechanism preferably takes the form of a robotic placement arm that is movable in three different spatial axes, such as conventional x-axis, y-axis and z-axis so that proper placement of the decorative film sheet may be assured. The placement mechanism may include a film gripping means such as vacuum-driven cups that selectively contact predetermined portions of the film sheet and can release it on demand. The placement arm may have hollow portions associated therewith that serve to mate with the raised registration pins of the mold core block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The molding machine also incorporates a retention mechanism that holds the film in place, and captures it in a position on the mold core block and between the mold core and detail blocks. This utilizes a novel retention plate that is held in place over the film sheet and over the mold core block by an electromagnetic system that is capable of selective energization, that when energized; clamps the film sheet in place across the parting line of the mold core block. This retention plate may utilize its electromagnetic attachment aspect to attach itself to either of the two mold blocks of the machine so that it may be initially attached to the mold core block and then attached to the mold core detail block when the two mold blocks are opened. A heat source that is selectively movable in and out of heating contact with the film sheet is also provided and is utilized to soften the film sheet so that is may be more easily drawn into the mold cavity. This heating contact occurs by means of an opening formed in the retention plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The mold core block preferably includes a mold core insert disposed therein that is formed from a porous metal insert. A vacuum is drawn on the mold core cavity by way of these pores when negative air pressure is applied to the mold core cavity, thereby negating the need for modifying either the mold core or the mold detail with vacuum passages that may weaken the overall strength of the mold core and its cavity. By using this porous insert, the vacuum is drawn evenly through the mold core cavity and the decorative film is uniformly drawn into the mold core cavity. Once the film is drawn into the mold core cavity, the mold detail is moved into the mold core cavity and a liquid molding material is injected into the resultant cavity. The injected molding material attaches itself to the film sheet that overlies the mold core cavity and assists in moving the film sheet to the outer reaches of the mold core cavity, to the extent that the vacuum drawing step has not accomplished this. The porosity of the entire, or selected porions of the mold core cavity, permits complex geometric shapes to be molded with an outer and sometimes decorative skin integrally attached to the final molded article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> After the decorative film is drawn into the mold cavity, the two mold blocks are brought together to close and seal the mold cavity. An injection nozzle is brought into contact with the mold blocks and, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, is brought in from the mold core side of the mold cavity. Its initial injection of molding material pieces through the film sheet drawn into the mold. Molten molding material then fills the cavity against the film sheet and becomes bonded to it. The injection pressure of the molding material also serves to force any remaining portions of the film sheet into contact with the mold core cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a second embodiment of the invention, when the liquid molding material is injected, and typically the injected material will be a heated and liquefied plastic, a homogenous one-piece plastic part is formed with an integral &ldquo;skin&rdquo; applied to the exterior surface thereof. The film sheet may be applied to either to exterior or to the interior surfaces of the final molded part by simply attaching the decorative film sheet to either the mold core or detail mold block. The film may have any one of a number of different designs disposed thereon and by different means such as screen printing, photolithography for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention which is particularly suitable for use in molding an article with a fabric covering, coacting members are provided for the injection molding machine, one of the members has a cavity portion associated therewith with a configuration of one side of the article to be molded, while the other of the two members has a detail portion that projects therefrom into the cavity portion of the other member when the two members are brought together along a parting line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A fabric sheet is interposed between the two members along the parting line and it may be positioned in registration with the cavity by way of a robotic arm, carrier plate or motorized drive assembly that is able to position the fabric accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When the fabric sheet is interposed between the members and after the two members are brought together, negative air pressure is applied to the cavity portions, and it communicates with the cavity by way of one or more porous metal inserts. These porous metal inserts are porous to the extent that they permit the passage through them of gasses without either permitting the passage of molding material through them or reducing the standard integrity of the cavity portion. This vacuum will draw the fabric sheet down into the cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In order to assist this drawing of the fabric sheet into the cavity, the detail portion also has one or more porous metal inserts associated therewith. A source of positive air pressure communicates with this insert and positive air pressure may be applied to the other side of the fabric sheet to assist in the drawing of the fabric sheet into the cavity. Molding material is then injected into the cavity on the other side of the fabric sheet while this material is being injected, the positive air pressure shuts down into a neutral mode so that it may serve as a vent for air evacuating from the cavity under the urging of the injected molding material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be clearly understood through consideration of the following detailed description. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a unique hybrid molding process in which a decorative sheet is drawn into a mold cavity into contact with a surface thereof so that a molding material subsequently injected into the mold cavity joins to the sheet. This process is referred to as &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; herein because it involves two different media: a material sheet and an injectable molding material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The Molded Article </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Turning first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> molded article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is shown as a wireless telephone housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a plurality of openings formed therein which range from small openings <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> used for the earphone and microphone to large openings <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> that receive bottoms and displays. The article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also has curved side surfaces, or contours <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and these curved surfaces continue from the sidewalls <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> of the article to the front surface <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a hollow body portion defined by a series of sidewalls <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and a front, or top wall <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. These walls <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> enclose and define an internal hollow cavity portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> which accommodates the internal circuitry and components of the telephone (not shown). In this regard, the article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has certain details formed with it in its cavity portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Such details may include standoff members <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> that may support a circuit board, hollow bosses <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that receive screws to hold the housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to rear housing part (also not shown), and a hollow microphone recess <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> that receives a microphone element therein. It will be understood that although this detailed description will follow in terms of the telephone housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> illustrated, that the benefits and advantages of the present invention are not limited solely to such an article and that it may be equally used in the production of other molded articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, it is often desirable to decorate the exterior surfaces of the walls <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the article. This may be done by molding the article in a single color or mixing different color molding materials together, such as plastic pellets. With such aspects one is limited to either a single color article or a variegated appearance with the mixed plastic. The present invention contemplates the application of a decorative film <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> to a selected surface of the molded article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, in this case the exterior surface(s) of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The Decorative Film Sheet </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Such an application is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, where a decorative pattern <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> has been applied to the exterior of the telephone housing. The decorative pattern <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> has previously been applied to a planar sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of film, preferably a plastic film. Examples of materials suitable for use as the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> that exhibit desirable drawing qualities and thermal characteristics are ABS, polyester, polycarbonate, polyethylene and TPR. The film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is preferably planar, as shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> in order to facilitate the decorating thereof such as, for example, by screen printing, photolithography, spray printing. Other methods may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A decorative pattern <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is deposited on the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in a predetermined decoration area <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> that lies within the edges <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. As explained in greater detail below, the decoration area <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is preferably spaced apart from the edges <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> to define a series of marginal borders <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that are present on all four sides of the decoration area <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The decorative pattern <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may include a series of detailed design elements as shown or it may include patches of color, letters, logos, etc. A sealing layer may be applied to the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> over the pattern <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> thereon (and extend past the borders of the pattern <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>) in order to give it a luster or glass or other desired finish and/or appearance characteristics as well as to, if desired, seal the pattern <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. The decorative pattern <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be deposited on the film sheet <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> for eventual registration with a portion or portions of the finished molded article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In this regard, means for registering the film sheet <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> with the details are part of the mold cavity, are preferably provided and are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as openings <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, illustrated as circular holes disposed within the marginal borders <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the film sheet <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and between the decoration area <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and the film sheet edges <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. Four such openings <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Once the decorative film sheet <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is drawn into part of the mold cavity, a suitable molding material, such as a plastic, is injected in a molten state into the mold cavity. In most injection molding applications, particularly thermoplastic applications, the injected material will be in a high-temperature molten state, but it is contemplated that the present invention may also be used in non-thermoplastic applications where the molding material is not necessarily injected at an elevated temperature, but is injected under pressure. The resultant molded article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and has the decorative film <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> intimately attached thereto and in effect, forming an exterior &ldquo;skin&rdquo; on the article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The decorative pattern <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> remains on the film sheet <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and is thus applied to the exterior surface of the molded article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The Hybrid Molding Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the method steps of the present invention are shown in somewhat a schematic fashion. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, all of the process components are shown. An injection molding machine that has a pair of co-acting mold parts, or blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. One such block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is commonly referred to as a mold core block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or a female part because it has a cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> disposed therein, with the cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> being shown in place within an insert <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. This mold core block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, within its interior cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will provide the exterior configuration to the molded article, i.e., the details and configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The other mold block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is one that is referred to in the art as a male part or mold block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> because it has detail portions that extend out therefrom and which are received in the cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> when the two mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are brought together. The detail and cavity portion cooperatively define, when brought together, the mold cavity of the molding machine into which a molding material is injected. This male part <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is responsible for defining and forming the interior hollow cavity portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the molded article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) and its associated internal details such as the standoffs <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, bosses <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, bases <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, etc. Hence, the term &ldquo;detail.&rdquo; This aspect of the injection molding machine is described in greater detail to follow and is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, preferably a robotic placement arm, may be provided as a means for moving and positioning a film sheet <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> in place within the injection molding process components. The placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is preferably capable of selective movement in all directions, such as along conventional spatial x-axes, y-axes and z-axes, such as those illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. This three axis movement ensures accurate placement of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> onto one of the two mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> illustrated has a support surface <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with a configuration that matches the configuration of both the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and the female mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Although this support surface <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a planar surface, it will be understood that any other complimentary configurations may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> This support surface <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is depicted as a flat platen <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> supported at the end of the placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and which may have, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a series of openings <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> formed therein, primarily to decrease the weight of the overall placement arm assembly. The placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> further has a means to hold or grip the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in place thereon, such as a vacuum-assisted mechanism, utilizing for example, individual suction cups <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that have negative air pressure supplied thereto by way of associated tubing <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>) that is connected to a source of negative air pressure or by means of a series of internal vacuum channels or passages that may be formed as part of the support surface and which communicate with the support surface <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is preferably controlled by a suitable control that is capable of selectively moving the placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and its platen <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> as desired for placement of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> on one of the mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Controllers such as computer-numeric controllers (CNCs) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are examples of suitable controllers to control the movement of the placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in all directions defined by the three axes set forth earlier. The ability to place the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in a direction along the z-axis represents an improvement over the prior art decorating systems that merely use a sheet of film fed from a roll over a mold cavity. In order to assist in the placement and registration of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> onto the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, registration means may be provided that are associated with one of the two mold blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> One such means is illustrated as registration members in the form of pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that are disposed upon one of the two mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and are illustrated as disposed on and projecting from the female mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A minimum of two such registration pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are needed to properly locate the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, while three to four such pins are desirable. The film sheet has corresponding registration openings <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> formed in its associated marginal borders <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that mate with and receive the registration pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. As shown best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 &amp; 4</cross-reference>, for example, the registration pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may take the form of tapered members, such as cones, which have tapered surfaces <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> that increase in diameter from the tip down to the base of the registration pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. These tapering surfaces <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> will engage and facilitate the guiding of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> into place on the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The larger diameter of the registration pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> at their base portions preferably matches that of the film sheet openings <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> so that they will secure the film sheet in place over the mold core cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As such, when the vacuum or other gripping means of the placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is released and the placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from its interposed position, the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> remains in place upon the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In order to facilitate the effort of the placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in placing the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, the female mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is usually maintained in a stationary position during the molding process and the molded article is freed from the cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by rearward movement of the male mold block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A retention mechanism is also employed in the process of the present invention in order to hold the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in place during injection molding. As shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, this mechanism preferably takes the form of a large retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with an associated opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> formed therein that approximates the cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> serves at least two distinct purposes. Firstly, it exposes a portion of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> so that a suitable heating means, such as a lamp, a heater or otherwise to be positioned in opposition to the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. One such heater <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Secondly, the opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> permits the entry of the core detail head <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the other mold block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, along with its associated male core detail tooling, into the mold core cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. After the heating source <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has softened the exposed portion of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> exposed through the retention plate opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to a sufficiently flexible state to permit it to bend and deform, negative air pressure is applied to the mold core cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and because of the structure of the mold core cavity as explained in greater detail below, the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is drawn completely into the mold cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Once the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is drawn into the mold core cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the other mold block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (i.e., the male part of the mold as illustrated in the drawings) is brought into engagement with the retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the other mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to form the assembly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A liquid molding material is subsequently injected into the mold cavity now formed between the two mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. This molding material may be a thermoplastic resin or other material that is injected under pressure and elevated temperatures, or it may be a molding material that is injected only under pressure. When the molding material has set, the two mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are disengaged and one of the two mold blocks <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is drawn apart from the other mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, thereby puling the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> out from the cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> At this stage of the process, the film sheet has the form illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, where a molded article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, such as the telephone housing <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, is integrally molded to the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. The pattern on what is considered the front face of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, conforms to the exterior surfaces <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in what is believed to be an intimate and integral attachment. In this regard, the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> may be considered as a &ldquo;skin&rdquo; of the molded article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The internal details <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are present and accessible from the rear of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is then trimmed from the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner to form a decorated molded article as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The Hybrid Injection Molding Machine </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The processes of the present invention can be easily accomplished with a conventional injection molding machine that has been modified slightly. Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, one portion of an injection molding machine that has been modified in accordance with the principles of the present invention is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. One half of the machine is illustrated, namely the female mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having a cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> formed within an insert portion <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The female mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a series of electromagnets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> associated therewith and the male mold block has a series of electromagnets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>&prime; associated therewith. These electromagnets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are controlled by a machine controller, or other control means (not shown) and may be selectively energized for the purpose of holding a retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in place over the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In a unique aspect of the invention and as indicated above, the electromagnets may be selectively energized so that they may adhere to either side of the retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. This aspect permits the electromagnets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to retain the retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in place upon the female mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the pre-injection and injection phases of the process (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> &amp; <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>), but retain the retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (by way of electromagnets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>&prime;) in place on the male mold block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> during the ejection phase of the process (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 &amp; 20</cross-reference>). This is most effectively accomplished by first energizing the first electromagnets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and subsequently de-energizing the first electromagnets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, while energizing the second electromagnets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is interposed between a series of rails <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, that extend the length of the machine and provide a means for the components of the machine to slide into and out of engagement of with each other. Associated with the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are position indicators <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that may be positioned alongside the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. These indicators may be linked to pneumatic, or other operators (not shown) and will depress upon contact of an opposing block or sensor disposed on the other mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to thereby signal their positions to the controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, a placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is associated with the machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. This placement arm is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and is supported on a drive assembly <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> shown as having a belt <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> driven by gears <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and enclosed within a housing <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. This drive assembly <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> moves the placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in the Z-axis direction. The placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is movable in the vertical direction (along the Y-axis) by a push rod or power cylinder mechanism <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. A similar mechanism <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> on the assembly will control movement in the X-axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has a support surface <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> disposed on a flat member, such as a platen or frame <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The framework <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> has a series of openings <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> decrease the weight of the overall frame member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. In order for the frame member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to hold or grip the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> effectively, a gripping means is provided. In the preferred embodiment illustrated, this gripping means utilizes a vacuum gripping system. Negative air pressure is supplied by way of pneumatic tubing <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> that extends to either vacuum cups <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or channels that are formed in the body of the frame member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. This type of gripping mechanism holds the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> flat on the support surface <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The frame member <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> also has a series of openings <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> that are coincident with the registration openings <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> formed in the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. The frame member openings <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> will receive the registration pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, as mentioned above, is utilized to deposit the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in place on the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In this step, the film sheet registration openings <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are aligned with and placed over the registration pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the base of these registration pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> should closely match that of the film sheet openings <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> so as to hold the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in place initially. A retention mechanism <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is provided to retain the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in place on the mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This includes a retention member in the form of a plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, this plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a flat portion <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> that includes four blocks <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> with openings <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> that are received on the machine rails <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. These blocks <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> are slidable on the rails <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> along the z-axis of the machine <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has a preselected thickness with an opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> disposed therein. The opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is disposed in the retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in alignment with both of the core cavity or the core detail portions of the female and male mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is metal in the preferred embodiment so that it may be held in place by the electromagnets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> on either side of the retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has preselected side portions <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> that extend outwardly so that they contact the electromagnets <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> on either side of the mold assembly parting line P-P. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> in the retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is aligned with and preferably slightly larger than the mold core cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>) or the mold core detail portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> with its projecting tooling <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. This opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> permits the two mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to be brought together to from a final interval mold cavity <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</cross-reference> with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> illustrating a transverse cross-section and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> illustrating a longitudinal cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As shown in these two figures, the core detail head portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> projects slightly past the face <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> of the male mold block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The core detail tooling portion has tapered shoulder portions <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. These tapered, or chamfered, shoulder portions <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> preferably extend all around the core detail head portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and are complementary in configuration to the interior perimeter <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> of the retention plate opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to provide a sound engagement therebetween. This only requires the base portion <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> of the core detail tooling <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> to be extended and therefore it occurs in the relatively larger base section <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> of the core detail tooling portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to eliminate any detrimental stresses from developing in the more finely structured tooling details <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> It can be seen that the combination of these two surfaces permits all three components: the male and female mold blocks <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, to interfit together without providing any further openings in the associated mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> where leakage may occur. By tapering these surfaces, the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> may be maintained on the original parting line P-P of the mold assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In an important aspect of the present invention, the mold core insert <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and specifically the mold core cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> thereof is formed from a porous metal material, such as that which is sold in the trade under the trade name &ldquo;PORCERAX&rdquo; sold by International Mold Steel, Inc. Of Japan. This material has a porosity such that approximately 40% of the total volume of the metal is made up of minute air passages. The pores of this type of metal are such that they are small enough to prevent the passage of plastic or resin particles therethrough, but are large enough to permit the passage of air and gas molecules, so as to permit the venting of gases from the mold. In this regard, we have discovered that an even vacuum may be effectively drawn through the porous material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the application of the present invention, the porous material forms the mold core cavity and one or more vacuum lines <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> that lead to areas within the insert <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. (FIG. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.) Negative air pressure is applied to these lines and a vacuum is drawn on the core cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This vacuum is drawn somewhat evenly for it is drawn through all areas of the core cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that are formed from the porous material. This is usually effective in drawing the en-tire film sheet exposed area into the mold core cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with almost full drawing occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In some instances, complete drawdown of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> will not occur, and in order to facilitate entry of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> into the mold core cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, either the entire core detail head portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> or selected portions thereof may also be formed from a similarly porous material. This porous material will permit positive air pressure to be applied through the core detail head portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in opposition to the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> by way of pneumatic passages <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> that are preferably formed in the male mold block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and in the core detail head portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. In instances where the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is not completely drawn into the cavity, the application of positive air pressure through the core detail head portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, will serve to force the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> into all crevices, corners, etc. of the core cavity to an extent such that the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and the core detail head portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> cooperatively define a molding cavity into which the molding material may be injected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the present invention, the injection molding head <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is associated with the female mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and is thus &ldquo;gated&rdquo; therethrough into the mold cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, meaning that the molding material is injected into the cavity portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. The molding head <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> may include a heated nozzle <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> having a central passage that is heated by conventional heating means <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> disposed in proximity to the nozzle <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight>. The molding head <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> may have an engagement base <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> that is engaged by an extruder (not shown) in a conventional manner in order to provide a supply of molding material to the injection head <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, where it is heated and passed into the final mold cavity <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. Both molding blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are mounted in a manner so that they may be selectively brought together and drawn apart. As mentioned previously, the female mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be maintained stationary and the male mold block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> moved in and out of contact therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> A conventional locking means for locking the two mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> together may be provided. One or more shock absorbers, such as snubbers <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> may be provided in association with one of the two mold blocks, shown as the male mold block in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> to absorb some of the massive forces that are encountered due to closing of the mold block assembly and/or due to injection pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The injection nozzle <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> has a tip end portion <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> that is gated to the mold core cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In the mold assembly illustrated, this gate <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> is located in an area that is normally trimmed away from the final product, such as in the display window <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The heat of the molten molding material and the injection pressure combine to develop a force sufficient to pierce the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> at its gated location <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Once the film sheet is pierced, the molding material impinges against the male mold block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> so that any portion of the core detail head portion <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> that opposes the injection nozzle thereby serves as a reaction surface to direct the injected molding material into all parts of the mold cavity <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. The injection pressure of this material may further assist in extending the plastic film sheet into contact with all surfaces of the mold core cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The resultant molded film sheet-article assembly has the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> integrally attached to it as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 &amp; 11</cross-reference>. The film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> acts as a &ldquo;skin&rdquo; to the molded article, as referred to above. This film sheet-article assembly is then ejected from the mold by any suitable means such as ejection pins and the like. The excess marginal area of the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is then trimmed from the article by any conventional means. The process is repeated again to mold another article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Significantly, the film may be placed robotically in virtually exact registration on the designated mold block. Although the female mold block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has been used in this description as supporting the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, the other, male mold block may be used to support the film, provided that it has a flat surface surrounding its core detail portion that will support the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in a flat orientation and that the detail tooling <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> does not interfere with the film sheet. The ability of the placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to move in three different directions enables the placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to deposit the film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> in an exact position on the mold block time after time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Application of a Fabric to the Molded Article </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The prior embodiments have been concerned with a hybrid molding process using a decorative film sheet. The present invention may also be utilized to mold a fabric to the molded article <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment of the invention, a fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is registered with the cavity so that it is interposed between the two mold blocks <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is thereupon incorporated into the molding process. In this embodiment, the fabric in essence, becomes a &ldquo;skin&rdquo; of the molded article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Due to the use of positive and negative air pressure in the processes of this embodiment, it is preferred to use a fabric that is either porous such as a rubber or latex fabric or a pressed material such as a felt. Other fabrics that may have a coarse or fine weave that transmits air therethrough will typically require a plastic or other fabric backing member <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> applied to one side thereof as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. This backing member, or layer <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, serves to reduce the porosity of the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. In this regard, it is believed that if a fabric blocks between about 70% to about 100% of air pressure directed at it, it will be sufficiently impermeable to be used with the present invention and drawn down under the urging of the positive and negative pressure without requiring the need for a sealing layer to be applied thereto. Such a sealing layer may be applied separately to it or it may be applied to the fabric by way of the carrier sheet described above. In actual applications, polyurethane fabrics and felts have been successfully bonded to molded articles during the molding process as have rubber and latex fabrics. Suitable backing members for other conventional fabrics such as wool, synthetic and blended fabrics have included cotton, polyester and vinyl backing layers. Other layers should also prove successful in sealing the fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The backing layer may be incorporated into a carrier assembly. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> illustrates one means <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of interposing the fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> between the male and female parts of the mold. This means includes a carrier sheet <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, similar to the decorative film mentioned previously in this application. Moreover, the material from which this sheet is made will be thinner and ideally more flexible than the aforementioned film sheet <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. Preferably, it may be formed from a polyester or vinyl material and will serve primarily as a support member for a sheet of fabric <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The carrier sheet <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has preselected dimensions that permit it to be utilized with a molding machine, such as that shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The carrier sheet <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has an inner decorative area <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to which a sheet of fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has been applied. The carrier sheet <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is larger than the fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> so as to provide an outer marginal area <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. This area <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may include registration openings <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> that are engageable with registration members or pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> that may project from the female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Those pins <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> will serve to hold the carrier sheet <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and its fabric in registration with and over the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of your mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the carrier sheet <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may be moved into place on the mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by use of a robotic placement arm <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in the manner described hereinabove with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. With the use of such a carrier sheet <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> could be firmly located between the two mold members <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by way of the retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that would be operated in the manner described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> After molding and ejection, the molded article <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> will have, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> applied to its exterior surface <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, with the backing material of the carrier sheet <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> being bonded to the article <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. The fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is applied to the exterior surface <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> of the article that is defined by the internal contours of the female mold member cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The inner parts of the article <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> such as posts and lugs <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, are defined by the exterior contours of the detail portions <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the male mold member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> illustrates an alternate way of positioning the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> over the cavity of the female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, a roll <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> of fabric is mounted on rollers <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> that are operatively connected to a drive mechanism, such as a motor or step motor or the like and the sheet of fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is threaded into guide members, such as rails <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> that may be positioned on the face <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> of the female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. These rails <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may be received within corresponding recesses <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> formed in a retention plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the purpose of the plate <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> being to retain the fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> on the female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and to preferably create a substantial air-tight seal between the mold cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for purposes explained later herein. These guides may be passive guides and only serve to direct the fabric in its travel across the female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or they may be active guides that grip and hold the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in place once it has been positioned over the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the female mole member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Other guiding and placement means may be used, such as a lock and pinion driven assembly or a tractor belt assembly that will pull the fabric over the mold cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Irrespective of the means of positioning the fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, it is preferred that the fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> be positioned at the parting line (or the interface) between the male and female mold members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and in a manner such that a substantial air or gas tight seal is maintained between the fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the female member mold cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This is to facilitate the drawing of the fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> into the mold cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> should also be mostly air impermeable of a highly effective nature that prevents about 70% to about 100% of air divided at a surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Once the fabric is positioned as shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, negative air pressure is applied to the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by drawing a vacuum through the porous inserts <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This vacuum is shown by the arrows V in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> and may be generated by a vacuum pump <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> connected to air passages <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> formed in the female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. These inserts <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> are preferably arranged in a pattern along the interior faces <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> of the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and may be positioned in a pattern that ensures effective draw-down of the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> into the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Cooling channels <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may be provided in the manner known in the art to provide cooling to the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> illustrates, in plan view, a portion of a female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and in particular, a cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> formed therein. The cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> shown takes the configuration of a wireless telephone, such as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> contains the injection molding gate <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> that communicates with the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in order to convey molding material, such as plastic or resin onto the interior cavity formed when the two mold members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are brought together. Because the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is drawn into this cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the heat and pressure of the injected material passing through the gate <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>(which is illustrated as located in an area if the telephone housing that will later be stamped out) will pierce the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> overlying it and enter the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As mentioned previously, the entire cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be made of a porous material. It is preferred in some applications that the porous material not be used in some portions of the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, such as the area <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> immediately surrounding the gate <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> or the areas where the two mold members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may meet in metal to metal contact such as the microphone holes <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and which are open in the final article. The porous material may also be used, as mentioned above in one or more inserts within preferred locations such as in locations where the fabric is drawn deepest into the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> in the general area <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> enclosed within the dashed line, or at the portions <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> that are approximately the farthest away from the gate <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Other locations may be used to obtain an even and useful drawdown. The same holds true for the detail portion and its function of providing positive air pressure to the cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> shows the application of the above-mentioned negative air pressure to the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This causes a drawing of the fabric sheet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> into the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The use and placement of multiple porous inserts <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> ensures that the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is initially drawn into the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> illustrates schematically the mating of the other, male mold member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> after the initial drawdown. The detailed portion <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of the male mold member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> also has one or more porous inserts <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> disposed therein and in communicating with the detailed portion <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and an air passage <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> that is connected to a source of positive air pressure P. In this fashion, positive air pressure, as shown by the arrows of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> is applied to the other side of the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to assist it in its drawdown into the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Thus, with the use of dual inserts <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> or both sides of the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, an even drawing is effected without wrinkling or tearing of the fabric. This may be considered as a pneumatic balance on the fabric. Once the fabric <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is drawn completely into the cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the molding material may be injected as shown and mentioned above through a gate in the female mold member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (or the male mold member <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). During injection, the input of positive air pressure is ended and the passage <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be used to vent gas or air from the mold cavity <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> While the preferred embodiment of the invention have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
