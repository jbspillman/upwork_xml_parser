<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method for repairing a liquid crystal display provided with a light transmitting member having an image display section. The method includes filling a filler, which has a refractive index substantially equal to that of the light transmitting member, into a scratch or scratches formed on inside and outside surfaces of the light transmitting member so as to repair the scratch or scratches. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a non-light emitting or light emitting type image display device, and more particularly to an image display device, a correcting method and a correcting apparatus in which scratches on a panel glass surface in an image display section are repaired, and which are useful particularly in a thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (hereinafter abbreviated as TFT-LCD) or a plasma display panel (hereinafter abbreviated as PDP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic view showing the sectional structure of a well known TFT-LCD as a typical example of the prior art. The drawing shows three scratches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> formed by mistake on the surface of a glass panel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in a display section. The scratches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are often observed when a manufacture apparatus contacts the glass surface in the manufacture process. Furthermore, the scratches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are formed particularly at locations where a glass substrate is held on a vacuum suction stage, and frequently generated by foreign matters caught between the substrate and the stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Environment management is performed at the manufacture site so as to reduce as much foreign matters as possible in the process, but it is impossible to completely eliminate foreign matters, so that scratches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> on the glass surface are generated in a statistical frequency. Moreover, it is impossible to check amounts of foreign matters generated every process, and actually in many cases the presence of the scratches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> formed on the glass surface is found for the first time in the final manufacture process of liquid crystal display panels, i.e., in the lighting inspection and whole appearance inspection performed before a polarizer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is applied to a liquid crystal display panel. Furthermore, back light is scattered by portions of the scratches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and the display quality in liquid crystal displays is frequently deteriorated to an extent which cannot be ignored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Since such liquid crystal display panels have gone through many processes, their added value is high. Therefore, loss of resources involved in disposal of such liquid crystal display panels in this stage cannot be ignored even if such disposal is low in frequency. Therefore, from the standpoint of social request for the conservation of environment resources, it is desired to repair the glass surface scratches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> by means of some measures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To solve the above-described problem, the following prior art has been generally used. More specifically, when a scratch or scratches are found on a glass surface in a display section of a liquid crystal display, a method has been employed, in which abrasion of the scratch or scratches and a portion or portions around the scratch or scratches is performed until such scratch or scratches are eliminated. This method is effective for a relatively shallow scratch or scratches having a depth of several &mgr;m or less, but is not entitled to be practical because such abrasion takes much time in the case of repairing a deep scratch having a depth of more than 10 &mgr;m. Further, there is offered a problem that it is even difficult to repair a wide scratch as compared with the above-described scratch, for example, when a micro crack develops deeply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a method of repairing that scratch which cannot be treated by way of abrasion is disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 150205/1993 or 118401/1994. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the technique disclosed in the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 150205/1993 comprises a method of dripping a liquid organic resin having a refractive index equivalent to or on the same order of that of a material of a glass substrate onto a scratch of the display panel glass substrate with a dispenser, which mounts a needle at a tip end thereof, thermosetting the resin, abrading a surplus resin remained around the scratch with a grinder, and flatting the glass surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The prior art document, however, has no detailed explanation of configuration and size of the needle mounted to the tip end of the dispenser, and supply condition of the organic resin and so on, and in no way numerically describes a situation, in which the organic resin is filled inside the scratch when the repair has been completed. Therefore, a standard used in judging to what extent the scratch is repaired or whether or not the object is attained is very vague, and it is difficult to judge the effectiveness of this technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, like the above-described prior art, the technique described in the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 118401/1994 comprises a method of filling the scratch with a liquid organic resin having a refractive index equivalent to or on the same order of that of the panel glass material, and thermosetting the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, this technique in no way details concretely how to fill the organic resin. Furthermore, a configuration of a portion, for which the scratch is repaired, is in no way described quantitatively, and it cannot but be said that it is difficult to precisely judge the effectiveness of the technique. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present application actually filled an organic resin in a scratch formed on a glass surface of a liquid crystal display panel on the basis of the above-described prior art, and have found that there are involved the following many problems and that the object cannot easily be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> First, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an explanation will be given to a method of filling a liquid organic resin into a portion with a glass scratch on a panel surface, thermosetting the resin, and shaving off a surplus resin. When it is taken into consideration that the smaller an amount of the surplus resin, the easier the disposal thereof in the event of removing the surplus resin by means of some measures, it is desirable to supply an optimum amount of the resin, conformed to a volume of the scratch as far as possible, only into the scratch. A glass scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is various in size depending upon a size of a foreign matter responsible for the scratch such that various scratches are generated including a small scratch of about 50 &mgr;m and a large scratch exceeding 500 &mgr;m. Furthermore, the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> has a depth in the range of several &mgr;m to several tens of &mgr;m, and is also various in configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Here, exemplifying a rectangular parallelepiped groove of 50 &mgr;m in width, 100 &mgr;m in length, and 5 &mgr;m in depth for the typical size of the glass scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, this scratch is of 25000 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>in volume. To precisely supply a minimum amount of resin (amounting to the volume of the scratch) into this scratch, it is essential to employ an injecting method in which an amount of the resin discharged at a time is made exceedingly small and is controllable. Concretely, it is required for the method to control the amount of the resin discharged at a time to at least 1000 to 5000 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Therefore, the filling of the resin into the scratch is implemented by repeating the above-described high precision discharging, and a tool capable of discharging a small amount of liquid drop is necessary in order to fill the scratch with the minimum amount of the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Here, an experiment has been conducted using a micro-syringe of the smallest volume (volume of 10 &mgr;L) among commercially available micro-syringes (small-sized syringes) for gas chromatography. Incidentally, this micro-syringe had a minimum graduation of 1 &mgr;L and a volume corresponding to that of a rectangular parallelepiped (10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>&mgr;m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>) with each side of 1 mm, the volume being extremely great as much as 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>times the volume of the above-described scratch of the typical size. More specifically, it is not possible with conventional syringes or dispensers to perform an operation of pouring the resin only into the area of the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> on a glass substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Actually, if the above-described micro-syringe is used to fill a liquid epoxy resin or the like into the scratch and the resin is then thermoset, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, it is only possible to supply a considerably excessive amount of the resin. In this case, the surplus resin had a difference in level, which far exceeded 150 &mgr;m. Therefore, to implement injection of a filler <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> conformed to the volume of the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and supply only an amount of the resin corresponding to the volume of the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a technique capable of extremely minimizing an amount of the resin discharged at a time is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A second problem is the pressing necessity of a technique of removing the surplus resin, on the assumption of supplying of the relatively excessive filler <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> For example, it is disclosed in the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 150205/1993 to remove a surplus resin by means of an abrasive and a grinder. Hereupon, the above-described small-sized micro-syringe was used to fill the resin into the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, and the resulting surplus filler having a shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> was subjected to grinding by the grinder or cutting by a cutter, and then there was obtained the shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. More specifically, there was caused a problem that the filler <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> partly fell off, the filler <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> was roughed at surfaces thereof, and cut residue <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the resin was generated around the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. So, it was difficult to perform the working for forming a flat configuration so that the filler <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> was left only in the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The reason for this is that the filler <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> itself was excessive in amount and liable to fall off because of a shearing force far too great in the mechanical removal of the surplus resin, and an excessive amount of the surplus resin necessitated an enhanced cutting efficiency attributable to a coarse grain size of a grinder wheel, resulting in an increase in roughness of the processed surface. Also, it is problematic that a new cleaning process must be added to remove cuttings and shavings generated by the cutting and grinding processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to dispense with the cutting and grinding processes, which accompany the repairing of scratch or scratches, and it is necessary to develop a method of reducing a surplus filler as far as possible so that a simple processing suffices even when the cutting and grinding processes are executed. Thus, to facilitate the process of removing the surplus filler, it is desirable that the method comprises supplying an amount of the filler <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> corresponding to the volume of the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> with good precision. More desirably, an ultra-high precision filling method is used to supply the filler <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> only into the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to permit the resin to be cured with some measures, which will not do any damage to the entire image display device, such curing ideally making the surface of the filler <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> substantially flush with the glass surface around the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for completion of the repair and doing away with any mechanical working. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A third problem is the positioning of the filler in the injecting process. Since scratch varies in size from several tens of &mgr;m to about several hundreds of &mgr;m, the scratch itself can be recognized with the naked eye. However, in order to inject the filler only into an area of the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> with good precision, it is impossible to attain the object by visually determining a position, to which the filler should be discharged and manually performing the work, and so it is necessary to exactly position a tip end of a filler discharge unit (e.g., the above-described micro-syringe) right above the scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> at least in the field of view of a substantial microscope or an optical microscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Regrettably, the above-described prior documents in no way describe the necessity of the positioning operation indispensable for attaining the object. Moreover, even assuming that the accurate positioning has been effected as described above, the problem concerning the removal of the surplus filler cannot be solved with the discharge performance of the micro-syringe as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A fourth problem is that, in order to repair the glass scratch <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in the production site with good reproducibility, an appropriate method of quantitative evaluation for configuration of the scratch as restored is needed, and this problem will be described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the method of precisely filling/restoring a scratch or scratches can be developed to solve the above-described problems, considerations will be given to those conditions, which configuration of a scratch or scratches as restored should meet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> First, repair of a scratch is defined by the fact &ldquo;the scratch is filled with an appropriate filler to present an appropriate configuration and is finished to produce a state, in which the existence of the scratch cannot be visually recognized any more&rdquo;. The cause to offer a problem in terms of display that a scratch or scratches are visually recognized will be investigated in details with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> in the case where a scratch or scratches are existent on a display panel glass surface of a TFT-LCD representative of an active matrix drive type display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With the TFT-LCD, light entering human eyes is classified into two types, that is, light passing through an opening of the TFT-LCD from a light source being back light, and a reflected light resulting from an ambient light being reflected by the surface of the display panel. Even if repair of a scratch or scratches is incomplete, cut-off of either of optical paths of the both lights is visually perceived for recognition of the presence of the scratch or scratches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> First, in the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> scratch on a glass substrate <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is accurately filled with a filler <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> having a refractive index equivalent to or on the same order of that of the glass and having substantially the same amount as a volume of the scratch, and the scratch is repaired such that a surface of the filler <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is made substantially flush with a surface of the glass substrate <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and has substantially the same smoothness of that of the surface of filler <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. In this case, light <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> from a back light proceeds along a normal optical path in a portion, in which the scratch is repaired, without any interference. Moreover, an ambient light <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> does not behave on the surface of the filler <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and on the surface of the glass substrate <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> significantly differently, and an edge of the filler <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is also contiguous to the glass in substantially the same flat surface, so that the scratch itself forms no specific point in terms of visual perception. Therefore, the scratch is completely repaired and is not visually perceived, and it can be said that ideal repair of the scratch can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an amount of a filler <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> as filled slightly exceeds a volume of a scratch, and a part of the filler <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is formed to slightly protrude outside of an edge of the scratch. Since a scratch is various in size and configuration, slightly excessive filling can practically occur even with the use of a high-precision filling method. Therefore, for the repaired configuration as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is important as a practical issue to establish a standard for clearly prescribing configurational limitations which cannot be visually perceived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In addition, the case as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is taken into consideration, in which the surface of the filler is substantially flat over a large part of a portion, in which the scratch is repaired, except the edge of the filler <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and the filler <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the glass substrate <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> substantially coincide in refractive index with each other. In this case, the back light (1) <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is in no way modulated at the interfaces of glass/filler and filler/air, and so advances along a normal path. Therefore, the scratch is not perceived in this area. Also, the ambient light (1) <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is similarly free of interference on the optical path in this area, and the scratch is not perceived in this area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> However, the situation differs in the edge of the filler <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. First, when the back light (2) <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> enters an edge of the filler <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (right edge of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), a part of light <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is partially reflected (<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>) at the interface of filler/air in a left downward direction, and at the same time the remaining light advances as an abnormal transmission light <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> in a direction offset from a straight advancing direction. Therefore, luminance distribution changes in this area, and the edge of the filler <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is visually perceived by a user who observes the image display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in the case where the ambient light (2) <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is incident upon the edge of the filler <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (e.g., a left edge of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), it branches into a reflected light <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> and a refracted light <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> at the interface of air/filler in the same manner as described above, and the both lights advance in a direction offset from a direction of incidence. Therefore, luminance distribution changes also in this area, which is visually perceived by the user. Actually, the back light <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and ambient light <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> are modulated in an entire outer periphery, defined by the edge of the filler <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, so that the entire filler <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is visually perceived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In addition, the above-described phenomenon can be discussed in the same manner, in the case where the filler is slightly insufficient, for example, in the case where a surface of a filler <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> is shaped to be slightly lower than a surface of a glass substrate <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which will be described later. As a result, the edge of the filler <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> is visually perceived. (Since the principle can easily be understood from the above description, the detailed description thereof is omitted.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the phenomenon of modulation, which the back light and the ambient light experience, depends on tapered angles of the fillers <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> on the left edge in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> on the left edge in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). More specifically, the phenomenon of modulation becomes insignificant as the tapered angles become smaller, with the result that the edge of the filler changes less in luminance change, which makes visual perception difficult. In other words, the smaller the tapered angles are, the less conspicuous the portion, in which the scratch is repaired, becomes, so that it becomes significantly meaningful to determine an optimum value of the tapered angle of the edge of the filler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The above-described prior-art problems will be put in order and described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an image display device, typified by TFT-LCD, in which a scratch or scratches on a glass surface of an image display panel is filled with a filler having a refractive index equivalent to or on the same order of that of glass, and repaired by: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> (1) performing accurate positioning for filling into an area or areas in which the scratch or scratches are present; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> (2) injecting an amount of the liquid filler corresponding to the volume of the scratch or scratches only into the area or areas, in which the scratch or scratches are present, and curing the filler; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> (3) desirably using a means for finishing a configuration, in which a filler surface and a glass surface around the scratch or scratches become substantially flush with each other, to repair the scratch or scratches, and the invention provides such means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> (4) Also, the invention provides a means for applying a slight-degree precision abrasion as desired, even when the filler becomes slightly surplus (protrudes from the scratch or scratches) or insufficient for an area or areas, in which the scratch or scratches are existent, to finish an edge of the area, into which the filler is, into a tapered configuration, which cannot be visually perceived, and also an image display device, which uses such means to realize repair of a scratch or scratches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> First, in order to repair the above-described scratch on the glass surface with high precision, a technique of supplying a liquid material only to an optional minute area on the glass surface is needed. This subject can be solved by using, for example, a micro-injection apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 8514/1996, and using a method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>D. More specifically, the apparatus is used for filling a liquid filler <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> into a pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> molded to have a tip end inner diameter of 1 to 10 &mgr;m, supplying an inert gas into the pipette from the other end thereof, and injecting a minute amount of the liquid material via the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Concretely, a discharge port of the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> filled with the liquid filler <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is positioned right above the scratch <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>), and the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is lowered with its inclination kept constant to be placed in contact with the scratch <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of a glass substrate <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>). Subsequently, a nitrogen gas <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is supplied into the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> from behind in a pulsed manner, and the liquid filler <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is discharged via the pipette tip end (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>). In addition, the above-described operation is implemented in the existence of a microscope, and the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is quickly raised from the glass substrate <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> every discharge so that the filling state in the scratch <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is confirmed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</cross-reference>). Furthermore, when an amount of filling is insufficient, the liquid material is repeatedly discharged and the discharging is completed when it is judged the scratch <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is completely filled with the liquid filler <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Here, when an amount of the liquid filler <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> discharged at a time is to be changed, it suffices to change the pressure of the nitrogen gas <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> or the pulse application time. Thereby, it becomes possible to optimize an amount of discharge of the liquid filler corresponding to a size of the scratch to perform injection of the filler with high precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> And, the implementation of the above-described concept and the solving of the above-described problems in (1), (2) and (3) can be attained by an automatic liquid material supply apparatus provided with (a) a mechanism for mounting on a stage a liquid crystal display panel with a scratch or scratches to position the same, (b) a mechanism for observation of a surface of the liquid crystal display panel, (c) a mechanism for operating the pipette filled with the liquid material to position the same, and (d) a mechanism for supplying an inert gas to the pipette from behind in a pulsed manner to discharge the liquid material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Concretely, after the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> molded to have the tip end inner diameter of 1 to 10 &mgr;m is filled with epoxy resin, the pipette is held, and its tip end is placed at a center of visual field in an optical observation system. Thereafter, the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is lowered, and contact between the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is sensed based on a state, in which the pipette tip end displaces on the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the nitrogen gas <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> having, for example, a pressure of 150 kPa is supplied from behind the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> in a pulse of 50 msec in width. At this time, the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> contacts the substrate <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> at an angle of 30 to 45&deg;, and supplying of nitrogen in a pulsed manner causes the liquid material <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> in the pipette to be discharged from the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> with a resolution of about 1 pL at minimum. Subsequently, after completion of supplying of the nitrogen, for example, 100 msec, the pipette <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is raised, and the pipette tip end is separated from the substrate <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, whereby it is possible to control an amount of the liquid material supplied with high precision. Incidentally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a relationship between the number of times, in which nitrogen is supplied from behind the pipette in a pulsed manner, and an amount of the liquid material supplied, both being related to each other in a substantially proportional manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Finally, it goes on to curing treatment of the filler after the injection of the liquid filler. In the curing treatment, it is necessary to select the optimum condition depending upon properties of the material used, while it is possible to employ thermosetting or photo-setting on the assumption that the liquid crystal display is not damaged. As the liquid filler, a thermosetting type epoxy resin, a thermosetting type acrylic resin, a photo-setting resin, and the like can be used. It is essential that the liquid filler have a refractive index equivalent to or on the same order of that of glass used in the liquid crystal display, the liquid filler is colorless and transparent, and that the liquid filler has a high adhesion to the glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition, with the above-described micro-injection method, supplying of the liquid filler of an amount corresponding to a volume of most of scratches on the glass can be performed highly precisely, but slightly surplus filling sometimes occurs in the event of a relatively small volume of the scratch. In such case, it goes without saying that a favorable configuration of a filled portion can be obtained by, for example, using a tape grinding apparatus to grind and remove the raised portion of the surplus filler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An important knowledge obtained by the inventors through the experiments reveals that, even when the panel surface and the filler surface fail to become perfectly flush with each other, the scratch on the glass surface cannot be visually perceived if a difference in level therebetween is within a range of &plusmn;5.0 &mgr;m, and a tapered angle formed between the panel surface and the end of the liquid material is 45 degrees or less, preferably ten degrees or less. Of course the reason for this is due to a physical reason that the difference in level between the panel surface and the filler surface, or the tapered angle formed between the panel surface and the end of the liquid material edge is small, but that, when the TFT-LCD is assembled, a polarizer is attached to the repaired glass plate via an adhesive layer of, for example, about 25 &mgr;m in thickness, to permit the adhesive layer to physically accommodate the difference in level of &plusmn;5.0 &mgr;m and to fit the tapered surface to function as an optical member for substantially eliminating the tapered surface.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter in details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an example of an apparatus for implementing a first embodiment, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an example of a scratch on a glass surface, which is repaired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> First, the apparatus for embodying the present embodiment comprises a stage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> with an LCD panel <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> mounted thereon for positioning, an object lens <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> and a CCD camera <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> for observation of a surface of the LCD panel <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, a illuminating light source <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, a half mirror <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, a monitor TV <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, a pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> filled with a liquid filler, a manipulator <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> for holding and positioning the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> so that the pipette contacts the surface of the LCD panel <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> at, for example, an angle of 45 degrees, an electromagnetic valve <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> for supplying, for example, N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>nitrogen gas into the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> in a pulsed manner, a light source <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> for curing the liquid filler supplied onto the LCD panel <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, and a light guide <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> for radiating the light from the light source <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> onto the LCD panel <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> used herein was prepared by thermally-treating, drawing and molding a borosilicate base hard glass tube having an outer diameter of 1.2 mm and an inner diameter of 0.7 mm, and a tip end having an inner diameter of about 5 &mgr;m. A material for the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is not required to be limited to glass. Moreover, a low-temperature curing type epoxy resin having a viscosity of 160 cps and a cured material refractive index of 1.541 was used as the liquid filler being filling in the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, but the filler is not limited to the epoxy resin provided that it possesses physical values close to the above-described physical values. Nitrogen gas under the pressure of 150 kPa is constantly supplied to a primary side of the electromagnetic valve <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the manipulator <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> and the electromagnetic valve <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> are controlled by a controller (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Here, an explanation will be given to initialization of the supplying condition of the nitrogen gas to the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> First, an operator uses the manipulator <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> to move the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> into a field of view of the monitor TV <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> to focus on the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, positions the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> to a predetermined reference point on the monitor TV <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, and causes the controller to store the position of the manipulator <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> at that time as an initial reference position. Thereafter, the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is retreated from the stage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, a dummy substrate <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> is mounted on the stage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, and the stage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is vertically moved to focus on the surface of the dummy substrate. Here, the dummy substrate <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> is for use in a trial experiment for setting the injection condition, and is made of the same material as that of the LCD panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, instructed by the controller, the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is caused to slowly descend and contact with the surface of the dummy substrate <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. When the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> contacts the dummy substrate surface, it can be confirmed on the monitor TV <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> that the tip end elastically deforms and shifts in a direction of inclination of the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>. An amount of the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> at the time of contact on the substrate is usually most suitable in the range of about 5 to 10 &mgr;M. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> When contact between the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> and the dummy substrate <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> can be confirmed, a trial experiment, in which the liquid filler is supplied, follows. Here, an amount of discharge per shot was roughly calculated in different pulse widths by fixing the pressure of nitrogen gas to 150 kPa, and changing the pulse width of supplying of the nitrogen gas between 10 msec and 300 msec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> More specifically, while the nitrogen gas supply pulse width was changed, an operation was repeated, in which the tip end of the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> was brought into contact with the surface of the dummy substrate <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>, the liquid filler was discharged one shot, the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> was retreated 100 &mgr;m upward 0.1 sec later after the discharge, and subsequently the stage was moved 1 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> After the above-described series of trial experiment was completed, the dummy substrate <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> was placed into, for example, a hot-air drying furnace to be heated therein at 100&deg; C. for two hours, thus permitting the resin being the liquid filler to be cured. A configuration of the spot-shaped cured product formed in this manner was measured using, for example, a laser microscope, volumes of the respective spot-shaped cured products were roughly calculated by means of the triangular pyramid approximation, and the discharge condition was determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As an example, on the condition that the nitrogen gas pressure was 150 kPa and the pulse width was 30 msec, an amount of epoxy resin discharged per shot was about 5 pL (5000 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>) in terms of a volume after thermosetting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> An example of using the above-described condition to repair a scratch formed on a glass surface of the TFT-LCD will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In addition, the TFT-LCD in the embodiment uses a glass material, which is one type of borosilicate glass having a refractive index of 1.54. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The TFT-LCD used in the experiment had an about 3 mm long fretting scratch on the glass surface, which could easily be perceived with the naked eye. A well-known stylus type surface roughness meter was used to measure a depth of the scratch to reveal the maximum depth of 9.4 &mgr;m, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. The low-temperature curing type epoxy resin was injected into the scratch under the above-described set condition. Since the scratch was elongated, the stage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> were repeatedly moved so that successive discharge was repeated while a position of discharge was moved in the longitudinal direction of the scratch. This operation was performed while confirming an extent of filling on the screen of the monitor TV <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>. The liquid filler was supplied 320 times from the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, but the total duration of the actual operation was about 15 minutes at most because the short pulse drive was repeated,. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> After judging on the screen of the monitor TV <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> that the filling was completed, the TFT-LCD panel after the filling was heated for about two hours in, for example, the hot-air drying furnace (about 100&deg; C.), which was filled with the nitrogen atmosphere, whereby the resin being the liquid filler was cured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In addition, a method of curing the liquid filler is not limited to the use of the above-described hot-air drying furnace provided that curing is possible with the use of another heat source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Measurement of substantially the same location before and after the repair reveals that a surface configuration of the scratch having been repaired through the above-described operation had an irregularity (concave/convex difference) around 0.7 &mgr;m as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, and an edge configuration of the resin <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> filled was extremely smooth. More specifically, measurement of surface roughness in the longitudinal direction of the scratch reveals that surface smoothness after the repair was uniform, and the existence of the scratch could not be perceived at least in a bright field of view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In addition, the surface configuration data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> are adjusted in terms of aspect ratio of the graph from the indication point of view, and so the abscissa must be enlarged in scale by about 13 times in order to grasp the actual configuration as an image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the relatively low-viscosity resin is used as the filler, whereby the resin surface after curing is extremely smoothly finished, and so the scratch can be repaired without application of any finishing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> After the above-described technique was used to repair the scratch on the glass surface, an adhesive material <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> was used to stick a polarizer <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> to the glass surface through a predetermined process, thus completing the liquid crystal display. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view showing the display. Here, adhesion of a liquid filler <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> (epoxy resin) filled in the scratch and a glass plate <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> is extremely close, and likewise this epoxy resin <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> also adheres well to the adhesive material <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> on the back surface of the polarizer <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> When the above-described liquid crystal display is operated in a well-known usual manner, light from a back light (not shown) incident from the side of TFT substrate <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> passes through a liquid crystal <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> and a color filter substrate <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> to exit to the outside (on a side of an observer). At this time, a part of the light passes through a portion on the scratch of the glass surface, but the filler <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> (epoxy resin) fills the scratch to make a surface configuration thereof smooth, so that the portion behaves as if it were a normal glass surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As described above, even if the glass surface may happen to be scratched by some reason in the manufacture process of the TFT-LCD, it is possible to repair the scratch by filling only a portion on the scratch with the filler, for example, epoxy resin, having a refractive index equivalent to or on the same order of that of glass. It has been confirmed that the liquid crystal display using the TFT-LCD repaired exhibits a display characteristic and reliability adequately comparable to those of a so-called non-defective liquid crystal display free of any scratch, and can be delivered to the market as having the same specification as that of the non-defective display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, a photo-setting type acrylic resin was used as the liquid filler. The photo-setting type acrylic resin was a visible ray curing type resin having a viscosity of 150 cps and a cured material refractive index of 1.48 and exhibiting a sufficient photosensitive characteristic in a visible ray area up to around a wavelength of 450 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A method similar to that of the above-described first embodiment was used to fill the resin into a scratch. More specifically, the pipette <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> was filled with a photo-setting acrylic resin, and the resin was supplied on the condition that the nitrogen gas pressure was 150 kPa and the pulse width was 30 msec. In addition, since the resin was a photo-setting type resin, the operation was performed in a dark room for the purpose of preventing the resin from being cured by observation light during the operation, and a filter for cutting a short wavelength light of 450 nm or less was used for the light from the light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Since the external shape of the scratch present on the glass surface was similar to that in the first embodiment, the resin was supplied in substantially the same manner as in the first embodiment, and the number of times, in which the resin was discharged was <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. And, a short wave-length visible light was radiated to a region where supplying of the resin was completed, via the light guide <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> from the light source <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> for curing the resin, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The light source used had an illuminance of 43 mW/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in a wavelength of 420 nm, and the irradiation duration was set at 30 sec. In this case, the irradiation energy amount was 1300 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A configuration of the scratch present on the glass surface at the initial stage and after resin is filling/photo-setting was measured using the well-known probe type surface roughness meter, the result of measurement being shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>. While the scratch at the initial stage had a depth of 11.6 &mgr;m at maximum, but after the repair it had a measured depth of about 0.9 &mgr;m (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference>) at substantially the same location (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference>). The scratch was repaired over the entire to such an extent that it could not be visually perceived at least in the bright view field range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>, an amount, by which the scratch was filled, is slightly insufficient in the present embodiment, but a steep difference in step is eliminated in the area where the scratch is present, and this apparently suppresses generation of inadvertent light scattering and refraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present embodiment, the use of the photo-setting type resin as the filler <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> for a scratch or scratches enables curing the resin cured in an extremely short time and completing the repair, for which a simple equipment suffices to serve, thus offering adequate convenience from the standpoint of productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C, in which a processing was performed on a scratch, which was slightly excessively filled, and surfaces of the filler <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> was finished to have substantially the same surface as the glass surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, a scratch caused on a glass surface was repaired by using a low-temperature curing type epoxy resin as the filler in the same manner as in the first embodiment, supplying the resin under the same discharge condition as in the first embodiment, and subsequently curing the resin in the well-known hot-air drying furnace under the nitrogen atmosphere of 100&deg; C. for two hours. Here, times, in which the resin was discharged was <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> shows the scratch before being filled with the resin, the scratch having a depth up to 20 &mgr;m. On the other hand, a surface configuration after the filling of the resin was convex and had a height of about 3 &mgr;m, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference>. As compared with the surrounding glass surface, a convex configuration, for which the scratch was repaired, having a height of about 3 &mgr;m can be adequately visually perceived for the reason of a large tapered angle. With such convex configuration in this state, light is unusually refracted or scattered, and so it is impossible that the liquid crystal display exhibits a satisfactory function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Therefore, while it was necessary to perform again a flatting processing on the convex portion where the scratch was repaired, the processing was performed in the present embodiment with the use of a tape polishing apparatus said to be generally capable of performing a precise processing. More specifically, while pure water was supplied to an area being polished (the convex shaped portion after filled with the resin), tapes of mesh &num;4000 and &num;8000 were used to successively perform tape polishing. In this case, a change in configuration of a portion where the scratch was repaired was successively observed with the well-known laser microscope, the course of the polishing was monitored, and an external appearance of the portion where the scratch was repaired was observed at a visual distance (about 25 cm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A surface of the portion where the scratch was repaired was polished until it finally became flat as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</cross-reference>. Therefore, it was not possible in the final finished configuration to perceive the portion where the scratch was repaired from a bright view distance. More specifically, a portion where a scratch is present can be adequately repaired with the combined use of the resin filling and the tape polishing even when such portion is slightly excessively filled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A fourth embodiment will be described hereinbelow with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> A scratch <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> caused by some reason was present on a surface of a glass <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>). A liquid filler <highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight> was supplied to the scratch <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> in the method described above with respect to the first to third embodiments. In this case, the filler <highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight> was supplied to the scratch <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> to completely fill (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference>). Subsequently, when the filler <highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight> was half cured, a well-known squeegee <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> or the like was used to remove the excessively supplied filler <highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight> so that a surface of the filler <highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight> became substantially flush with a surface of the glass <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13C, 13D</cross-reference>). Thereafter, the method described above with respect to the first to third embodiments was used to cure the filler <highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight> as at <highlight><bold>1605</bold></highlight>, thus completing repair of the scratch <highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13E</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> A configuration of an edge of the resin filled be means of the above-described method was extremely smooth upon measurement of surface roughness, and the presence of the scratch could not be perceived at least under a bright field situation. Moreover, in the case where, after the scratch was repaired, a polarizer was stuck to the surface of the glass through the predetermined processes to complete a liquid crystal display, a result of lighting display revealed that the portion where the scratch was repaired behaved as if it were a normal glass surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The first to fourth embodiments have been described above. An important knowledge obtained by the experiment carried out by the inventors reveals that, even when a glass surface fails to become completely flush with a filler surface as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C, a</cross-reference> scratch on the glass surface cannot be visually perceived provided that a difference in level between the both is within a range of &plusmn;5.0 &mgr;m as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, and a tapered angle defined by the glass surface and the filler edge is 45 degrees or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is an enlarged view showing a portion where a scratch is repaired, in associated with assembly of the TFT-LCD shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> filler <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, which fills the scratch, is shown to be convex in configuration, and a polarizer <highlight><bold>1303</bold></highlight> is stuck to a glass substrate <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, which includes the filler <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, via an adhesive material <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> having a thickness of, for example, about 25 &mgr;m. At this time, the adhesive material <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> serves to bury the convex portion of the filler <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the adhesive material <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> also serves to fit to the filler <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> at an edge, that is, a tapered portion of the filler <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> in the repaired portion to substantially eliminate the tapered surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The above-described matter means that, in the case where the generally frequently used adhesive material <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> is of about 25 &mgr;m in thickness, and a difference in level (H) between the cured surface of the filler filled in the scratch and the surrounding glass surface is at most &plusmn;5 &mgr;m, the difference in level is accommodated by the adhesive material <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the smaller a ratio H/W of the difference <highlight><bold>1308</bold></highlight> (H) in level and a minimum width <highlight><bold>1309</bold></highlight>(W) of the filler <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> after curing, that is, an angle <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight> (tapered angle &thgr;) defined between the surface of the filler and the surface of the glass <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> at an edge of the filler <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, the more the adhesive material <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> accommodates an influence of the difference in level, and thus the adhesive material optically acts as if there were not any difference in level, which involves the tapered angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>C are views illustrating a concrete example of a scratch caused on a glass surface. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> is a view showing an appearance of the scratch observed using an optical microscope, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference> being a view showing a three-dimensional image of the scratch by the observation of a laser microscope, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</cross-reference> being a view showing a sectional profile obtained with the use of the laser microscope and overlapped on an image obtained with the use of the optical microscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In addition, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C are views illustrating a concrete example of a scratch after repair, the respective figures corresponding to FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>C, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> From these results, it is apparent that a scratch before repair, such as a shell-shaped large scratch and a deep scratch observed centrally of the large scratch has been subjected to local supplying and curing of the above-described filler to be repaired to such an extent that it cannot be visually perceived in the bright view field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Table 1 shows results of examples, in which the above-described method was used to repair scratches on a glass surface, and indicates relationships among a scratch depth, a height (H: a difference between a filler surface and a glass surface) of a filler after curing, a minimum width of the filler (W), a tapered angle at an edge of the filler, and an external appearance (corresponding to the display characteristic during lighting) checked after sticking of a polarizer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As apparent from the result, when a scratch on a glass surface is filled with a filler to be repaired and a polarizer is stuck to the glass surface through the usual processing to complete a liquid crystal display, substantially the same display quality as that of a display with no scratch thereon can be secured by controlling a difference in level for and a configuration at an edge of the filler and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As described above, liquid crystal displays heretofore discarded as defective products because of a scratch or scratches present on a glass surface are restored as good products, thereby contributing to saving in resources, production energies and the like in the society, and contributing much to enhancement of product yield, cost reduction, and the like in enterprises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it goes without saying that the above-described embodiments can be applied to repairing in display sections not only of TFT-LCD, but also of other non-light emitting and light emitting type image display devices, and can also be applied to PDP, electroluminescence elements, flat Braun tubes, and other displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, the presence of a scratch on a glass surface cannot be perceived visually by locally supplying a filler to the scratch, and when applied, for example, to repairing of a scratch on a glass surface of TFT-LCD, a portion repaired can in no way offer any significant difference in display quality to a portion surrounding the repaired portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> While we have shown and described several embodiments in accordance with out invention, it should be understood that disclosed embodiments are susceptible of changes and modifications without departing from the scope of the invention. Therefor, we do not intend to be bound by the details shown and described herein but intend to cover all such changes and modifications a fall within the amabit of the appended claims. </paragraph>
