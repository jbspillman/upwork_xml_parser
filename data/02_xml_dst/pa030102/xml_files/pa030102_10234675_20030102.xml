<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a steerable medical catheter and, more particularly, to a flexible, electrode-bearing catheter of the type used in electrophysiological studies for intracardiac electrocardiographic recording, mapping, stimulation and ablation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Catheters are often used in medical procedures to provide physical access to remote locations within a patient via a relatively small passageway, reducing the need for traditional invasive surgery. The catheter tube can be inserted into an artery or other passageway through a relatively small incision in the patient&apos;s body, and threaded through the patient&apos;s system of blood vessels to reach the desired target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Various types of catheters are used in various procedures, both diagnostic and therapeutic. One general type of catheter used for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications is a cardiac electrode catheter. The diagnostic uses for a cardiac electrode catheter include recording and mapping of the electrical signals generated in the course of normal (or abnormal) heart function. Therapeutic applications include pacing, or generating and placing the appropriate electrical signals to stimulate the patient&apos;s heart to beat in a specified manner, and ablation. In an ablation procedure, electrical or radio-frequency energy is applied through an electrode catheter to form lesions in a desired portion of the patient&apos;s heart, for example the right atrium. When properly made, such lesions will alter the conductive characteristics of portions of the patient&apos;s heart, thereby controlling the symptoms of supra-ventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and other arrhythmias. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such a catheter is typically placed within a desired portion of the patient&apos;s heart or arterial system by making a small incision in the patient&apos;s body at a location where a suitable artery or vein is relatively close to the patient&apos;s skin. The catheter is inserted through the incision into the artery and manipulated into position by threading it through a sequence of arteries, which may include branches, turns, and other obstructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Once the cardiac electrode catheter has been maneuvered into the region of interest, the electrodes at the distal end of the catheter are placed against the anatomical feature or area sought to be diagnosed or treated. This can be a difficult procedure. The electrophysiologist manipulating the catheter typically can only do so by operating a system of controls at the proximal end of the catheter shaft. The catheter can be advanced and withdrawn longitudinally by pushing and pulling on the catheter shaft, and can be rotated about its axis by rotating a control at the proximal end. Both of these operations are rendered even more difficult by the likelihood that the catheter must be threaded through an extremely tortuous path to reach the target area. Finally, once the tip of the catheter has reached the target area, the electrodes at the distal end of the catheter are placed in proximity to the anatomical feature, and diagnosis or treatment can begin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the past, the difficulties experienced by electrophysiologists in the use of a cardiac electrode catheter have been addressed in a number of different ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To facilitate maneuvering a catheter through a tight and sinuous sequence of arterial or venous passageways, catheters having a pre-shaped curve at their distal end have been developed. To negotiate the twists and branches common in a patient&apos;s arterial or venous system, the catheter typically is rotatable to orient the pre-shaped curve in a desired direction. Although the tip of the catheter may be somewhat flexible, the curve is fixed into the catheter at the time of manufacture. The radius and extent of the curvature generally cannot be altered. Therefore, extensive pre-surgical planning is frequently necessary to determine what curvature of catheter is necessary. If the predicted curvature turns out to be incorrect, the entire catheter may need to be removed and replaced with one having the proper curvature. This is an expensive and time-consuming ordeal, as catheters are generally designed to be used only once and discarded. Moreover, the additional delay may place the patient at some additional risk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A variation of the pre-shaped catheter uses a deflectable curve structure in the tip. This type of catheter has a tip that is ordinarily substantially straight, but is deflectable to assume a curved configuration upon application of force to the tip. However, the tip deflection is not remotely controllable. In a certain patient&apos;s arterial system, a point may be reached at which the proper force cannot be applied to the catheter tip. In such cases, the catheter must be withdrawn and reinserted through a more appropriate passage, or another catheter with a different tip configuration must be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another attempt to facilitate the placement of catheters takes the form of a unidirectional steering catheter. A typical unidirectional steering catheter has a steering mechanism, such as a wire, that extends the length of the catheter to the distal tip. The steering mechanism is coupled to the tip in such a way that manipulation of the proximal end of the mechanism (e.g., by pulling the steering wire) results in deflection of the catheter tip in a single direction. This type of catheter is illustrated, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,125,896 issued to Hojeibane. The direction of deflection can be controlled by embedding a ribbon of wire in the tip; the ribbon is flexible along one dimension but not in others. This type of catheter can further be controlled by rotating the entire shaft of the catheter; in this manner, the direction of bend within the patient can be controlled. The shaft of such a catheter must be strong enough to transmit torque for the latter form of control to be possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,383,852 to Stevens-Wright describes a steerable electrocardial catheter including a flexible tip assembly having a proximal and a distal section. In this catheter, two steering mechanisms are used to separately control bending of either or both the proximal and distal sections. The steering mechanisms for the proximal and distal sections include separate steering wires, as described above, which are coupled to the proximal and distal sections, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Bidirectional steering catheters also exist. The distal end of a bidirectional steering catheter can be maneuvered in two planes, allowing the tip to be positioned with greater accuracy. However, bidirectional steering catheters are complex mechanically and are often difficult to manipulate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing types of catheters address the issue of maneuverability in different ways, none of them is ideally configured to maintain contact with and apply a desired amount of pressure to a desired anatomical feature, such as an atrial wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One device used for the latter purpose is known as a basket catheter. See, for example, the HIGH DENSITY MAPPING BASKET CATHETER manufactured by Cardiac Pathways Corporation. A basket catheter has several spring-biased arms near the distal tip. When these arms are unconstrained, they bow outward to define a basket-like shape. The arms of the basket are constrained for implantation in a sheath structure. When the tip of the catheter has reached the desired location, the sheath is retracted, or the arms are advanced out of the sheath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, because the tip of the catheter is sheathed, it is not easily steerable into location, and is not as flexible as one might desire. Moreover, the sheath adds bulk to the device, which might significantly limit the range of applications in which the basket catheter can be used. The basket has only one shape and size. Once the arms are deployed from the sheath, the basket assumes a single configuration defined upon manufacture. If the predefined configuration of the basket is not suitable, then substantially no correction is possible. Also, known basket catheters are not indicated for use in high-energy therapeutic applications, such as ablation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A variable-geometry sheathed electrode catheter is also known in the art. This device has a single electrode-bearing tip portion that is initially disposed within a relatively inflexible sheath. When the tip portion is advanced with respect to the sheath, the tip portion bows out of a slot-shaped aperture in the sheath. The shape of the tip portion can be controlled to apply a desired amount of pressure to an anatomical feature. However, as a sheath is used around the catheter, the device is not easily steerable into location. Moreover, as discussed above, the sheath structure adds undesirable bulk to the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Radio frequency ablation (RFA) has become the treatment of choice for specific rhythm disturbances. To eliminate the precise location in the heart from which an arrhythmia originates, high frequency radio waves are generated onto the target tissue, whereby heat induced in the tissue bums the tissue to eliminate the source of arrhythmia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For successful ablation treatment, e.g., to produce a lesion at a given anatomical site, it is generally required that the catheter be accurately positioned at the ablation site and that continuous contact be maintained between the electrode and the ablation site for the duration of the ablation treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,617,854 to Munsif describes, inter alia, a pre-shaped catheter particularly useful for ablating in the vicinity of the sinoatrial node, the left atrium, and up to the mitral valve. The tip of the catheter is formed of a temperature-sensitive shape-memory material, e.g., Nitinol, or is otherwise invoked to assume a segmented configuration upon reaching a desired position. The segmented configuration includes a distal segment which bears an ablation electrode. In operation, the segmented shape produces tension which urges the ablation electrode on the distal segment into contact with a wall of the left atrium, while other segments are urged against other tissue. Since the shape of the catheter tip is fixed, the tip is not easily manipulated. Further, the tension produced between the segments of the catheter tip is dependent on the shape and dimensions of the ablation site, e.g., the left atrium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are the most common type of arrhythmia found in clinical practice. Although the potential adverse consequences of these types of arrhythmia is well known, the basic electrophysiological mechanisms and certain management strategies to control these types of arrhythmia have been understood only recently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which schematically illustrates a cross-section of a human heart <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> showing typical atrial flutter circuits. Such circuits includes macro-entrant, counter-clockwise, pathways <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from the right atrium <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, through the inter-atrial septum <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, down the free wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and across the isthmus of tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> between the inferior vena cava <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the tricuspid annulus <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the tricuspid valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Most electrophysiologists recommend treating atrial flutter by producing a linear contiguous lesion <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> at the isthmus of tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, between vena cava <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the tricuspid annulus <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Linear lesion <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can be produced by RF ablation electrodes which are placed in contact with tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that isthmus tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is a critical link of the atrial flutter circuit and, thus, linear lesion <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is expected to terminate this source of arrhythmia and prevent the recurrence of such arrhythmia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Existing ablation treatment for atrial flutter includes the use of a catheter bearing at least one single or bi-polar ablation electrode. Unfortunately, an undue amount of time is spent in correctly positioning the ablation electrode of the catheter against the site to be treated. Further, in existing electrode catheter configurations, the catheter must generally be repeatedly repositioned until an acceptable lesion <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is produced. Thus, lesion <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is often non-continuous, i.e., there may be gaps in the lesion line which may require further repositioning of the ablation catheter. Such repeated repositioning of the catheter is time consuming and may result in prolonged, potentially harmful, exposure of patients to X-ray radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a cardiac electrode catheter that can be conveniently and quickly steered into secured, operative, engagement with a preselected portion of the isthmus of tissue between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus, to produce a predefined, substantially continuous, lesion on this isthmus of tissue. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to provide a steerable electrode catheter having a relatively flexible distal end portion accommodating an elongated configuration of at least one ablation electrode, that can be conveniently guided to the vicinity of the tricuspid valve, and that can be steered into a shape which enables convenient positioning of at least one ablation electrode in secure operative engagement with an ablation site along the isthmus of tissue between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus, thereby to produce a predefined, elongated, substantially continuous, lesion at the ablation site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the catheter includes a flexible distal end portion which may be controlled by one or two steering mechanisms, namely, a distal steering mechanism and, optionally, a proximal steering mechanism. The distal steering mechanism is adapted to deflect only the tip of the distal end portion into a hook-shaped configuration. The proximal steering mechanism is adapted to deflect the entire distal end portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the at least one ablation electrode is brought into secured engagement with the isthmus of tissue between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus, as follows. First, the distal end of the catheter is guided into the right atrium. As the distal end of the catheter advances in the right atrium, the proximal steering mechanism may be activated to deflect the entire distal end portion, such that the distal end portion may be conveniently inserted into the right ventricle. Once the distal end portion is inside the right ventricle, the distal steering mechanism is activated to produce the hook-shape configuration at the tip of the distal end portion. Then, the catheter is pulled back, i.e., in the direction of the right atrium, until the hook-shaped tip of the distal end is anchored at the tricuspid annulus. The catheter may then be pulled further back and the curvature of the distal end portion may be adjusted, e.g., using the proximal steering mechanism, until the at least one ablation electrode securely engages an ablation site along the isthmus of tissue between the tricuspid annulus and the inferior vena cava. Once such secured engagement is obtained, the at least one ablation electrode may be activated to produce a substantially continuous, linear, lesion at the ablation site.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a handle portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, electric connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a tubular catheter shaft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> including an end shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a distal tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a distal tip deflection region <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a proximal deflection region <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. According to the present invention, distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be steered from a generally straight configuration, indicated by the solid lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to a deflected configuration, indicated by the broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The broken line configuration in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also illustrates how distal tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be deflected into a hook-shaped configuration, as described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may include a sensor or mapping electrode, as is known in the art, for monitoring the electric potential of tissue in contact therewith. This may be helpful in guiding and positioning distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Reference is now also made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> which schematically illustrates a side-view, cross-section, of distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. End shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which is preferably hollow as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, accommodates an elongated configuration <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of ablation electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Elongated configuration <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may include any number of electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, with a predetermined spacing therebetween, or a single elongated electrode, as known in the art, adapted to produce a substantially continuous, substantially linear, lesion when brought into operative engagement with a target tissue. Electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are preferably all ring-electrodes covering the entire circumference of shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made also to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C which schematically illustrate front-view cross-sections of distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along section lines A-A, B-B, and C-C, respectively, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In accordance with the present invention, catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a distal steering mechanism which is used to deflect tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as mentioned above, by producing a small radius of curvature at region <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a proximal steering mechanism which controls the curvature of region <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, between shaft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, thereby to control the deflection of the entire distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The distal and proximal steering mechanisms may include any suitable steering mechanisms known in the art, for example, the control mechanisms described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,383,852 to Stevens-Wright, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, the distal and proximal control mechanisms may include control wires <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, respectively, which extend along the interior of shaft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from handle portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to regions <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, respectively, of distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Wire <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is attached to tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and may extend through middle guiding loops along most of the length of shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</cross-reference>, and then through off-center guiding loops at region <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, whereby only a small segment adjacent to tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is deflected by wire <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Wire <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may extends through off-center guiding loops in shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, and is attached to end shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at region <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The deflection of distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into a desired configuration is preferably controlled by an electrophysiologist using control members <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on handle portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, control member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may include a rotatable control member attached to wire <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, such that forward or backward rotation of control member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> results in corresponding movement of wire <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, thereby controlling the deflection of end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at region <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Control member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may include a slidable control member attached to wire <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, such that forward or backward sliding of control member <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> results in corresponding movement of wire <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, thereby controlling the deflection of end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at region <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. As known in the art, the electrophysiologist may also rotate distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about the longitudinal axis of catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Any suitable rotation mechanism, as is known in the art, can be used to control the rotation of distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, catheter shaft can be made of a rotationally rigid material that transmits the rotation of handle portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to distal end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the rotation of handle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be transmitted by a rotationally stiff member (not shown) extending longitudinally through the interior of catheter shaft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are addressed, together or separately, via connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which are connected to electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by conductors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Conductors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may extend along the interior of catheter shaft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and end shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, for example, through middle guiding loops, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Using connectors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are connected to an ablation energizing circuit, which may be activated by user controls as are known in the art. Upon activation, the energizing circuit energizes electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with radio frequency (RF) energy, as is known in the art. Using separate ablation controls, the electrophysiologist may activate electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> together or separately (if selective ablation is desired) to ablate a target tissue, as described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As known in the art, electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be associated with temperature sensors (not shown in the drawings) which may be connected to temperature monitoring circuitry for monitoring the temperature of the tissue in contact with electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An output of the temperature monitoring circuitry may be visually displayed to the electrophysiologist, as is known in the art, to provide the electrophysiologist with on-line indication of the electrode temperatures, which are indicative of adjacent tissue temperatures. If temperature sensors are used, they may be connected to the monitoring circuitry via connectors <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and additional conductors (not shown) in catheter shaft <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used for ablating tissue on the endocardium isthmus of tissue between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus of a patient suffering from aberrant heart activity, such as atrial flutter or fibrillation, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> schematically illustrate a procedure for introducing catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the right atrium and subsequently guiding distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to securely engage a portion of the endocardium tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is first guided into the right atrium of the patient&apos;s heart <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from the inferior vena cava. Once catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is introduced into the right atrium, the electrophysiologist proceeds to deflect distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> towards the right ventricle <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, using the proximal steering mechanism of catheter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> enters the right ventricle via the tricuspid valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. If necessary, end shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be rotated to assist in the manipulation of distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> After distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inserted into the right ventricle, the electrophysiologist uses the distal steering mechanism to deflect tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into the hook-shaped configuration described above, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Then, the catheter is pulled back, i.e., in the direction of inferior vena cava <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, until a portion of the tricuspid annulus <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is grasped by the hook-shaped tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Once tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is anchored at the tricuspid annulus, the catheter may be pulled further back and the curvature of distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be adjusted, using the proximal steering mechanism, until electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of elongated configuration <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> securely engage a portion of the isthmus of tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> between tricuspid annulus <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and inferior vena cava <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. At this point, the electrophysiologist activates some or all of electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to ablate a substantially continuous, substantially linear, lesion on the endocardial wall of the isthmus of tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As described above, electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be associated with temperature sensors. These sensors may include thermocouples or any other temperature sensing means known in the art. Based on the temperatures measured by these optional temperature sensors, the electrophysiologist may deactivate some or all of electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when the temperature of the ablated tissue site exceeds a predetermined threshold. Then, when the temperature of the ablated sites drops below the threshold, the electrophysiologist may reactivate electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> if further ablation is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may optionally include a sensor electrode for monitoring/mapping the electrical potential of tissue adjacent tip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, e.g., to enable more accurate and/or more efficient positioning of end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> against isthmus of tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Sensor electrodes may also be included in electrode configuration <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, e.g., for mapping the electrical potential along isthmus of tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, during or between ablation sessions, to determine whether further ablation may be necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> which schematically illustrates a distal end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of an ablation catheter in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, having an elongated electrode configuration <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> including a plurality of electrodes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and a tip <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, distal end potion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is adapted to be steerable or deflectable at three regions, namely, a distal tip deflection region <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, an intermediate deflection region <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and a proximal deflection region <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. Regions <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> are generally analogous to the distal and proximal deflection regions <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, respectively, of distal end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as described above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Intermediate deflection region <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may be located at a predetermined position along electrode configuration <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The mechanisms for deflecting end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> at regions <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> may be similar to those used for deflecting end portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at regions <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, respectively, as described in detail above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The mechanism for deflecting distal end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> at intermediate region <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may include any suitable deflection mechanism, for example, a control wire (not shown) extending through the hollow interior of end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, analogous to control wires <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The curvature of end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> at any or all of regions <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> may be controlled by the electrophysiologist using any suitable controls (not shown), for example, handle controls similar to controls <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Thus, in this embodiment, the electrophysiologist may control the curvature of distal end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> at region <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, in addition to controlling the curvature of distal and proximal regions <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. The addition of intermediate deflection region <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> enables more flexibility in conforming the shape of distal end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to the shape of isthmus of tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> during ablation treatment. In an embodiment of the present invention, intermediate deflection region <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is adapted to be deflected in the direction indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, so as to provide improved contact with isthmus of tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> when end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is urged against the tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the present invention, end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is not deflectable at region <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> but, rather, end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is formed of a resilient material and is pre-shaped to have a predetermined curvature at region <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, as shown generally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In this embodiment of the invention, when end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is urged against a target tissue, such as isthmus of tissue <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the curvature of region <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> changes until electrode configuration <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> conforms to the shape of the target tissue. This ensures urged contact between electrodes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and the target tissue without an additional steering mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the present invention, end portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is deflectable only at distal region <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, to assume a hook-shaped configuration as described above, but is not deflectable at proximal region <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. End portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may also be pre-shaped or deflectable at intermediate region <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, as described above. In this embodiment, once the tricuspid annulus is grasped by the hook-shaped tip of the catheter, it is primarily the backward pulling force applied by the electrophysiologist that brings electrodes <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> into urged contact with the target endocardial tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention may be carried out using any of the above described configurations of electrodes and/or deflection regions and/or pre-shaped regions, as well as any other suitable configuration of electrodes and/or deflectable/pre-shaped regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described herein with reference to the accompanying drawing. Rather, the scope of the present invention is limited only by the following claims: </paragraph>
