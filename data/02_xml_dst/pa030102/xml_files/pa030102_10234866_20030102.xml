<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The subject invention is directed to methods and apparatus for facing cylindrical workpieces such as tube and pipe ends or the like. More particularly, the invention is directed to facing tools for accommodating a variety of tube/pipe sizes while preventing unwanted vibration and movement of the workpiece and tool during a facing operation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Metal tubes and pipes are commonly used as conduits for fluids such as gases and liquids used in a wide variety of applications. Often these conduits run throughout a facility over great distances. Tubes and pipes are manufactured in a variety of lengths and sizes. In order to assemble the conduits in long runs, a plurality of such conduits may be butt welded together end to end. The conduits further may be welded to various flow control devices such as valves, mass flow meters, manifolds, elbows and so on. The tube or pipe typically is cut to a specified length by any convenient means such as a tube cutter or even a hacksaw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A cut tube or pipe end usually is not in good condition for immediate welding. The cut end of such a workpiece is finished or &ldquo;faced&rdquo; so that the end is square and chips, burrs and other anomalies are removed. This provides a tube or pipe end that can then be more easily welded to another tube or pipe end, flow device or other tube/pipe end attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The cut end is prepared using a facing tool. Generally, facing tools have a cutting tool that is rotated by a motor or other drive device. The cutting tool is brought into contact with the end of the workpiece and shaves off material from the cut end to form a clean square end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Known facing tools have a number of design features that limit their overall usefulness. Such tools, for example, do not adequately hold the workpiece still during a facing operation. With the cutting tool rotating at high speed, vibration of the cutting tool itself or movement and vibration of the workpiece can reduce the overall quality of the finished end, possibly necessitating additional facing, manual re-work or scrap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Known facing tools further suffer from limitations on the workpiece diameters that can be faced using a specific tool configuration. Tubes and pipes, for example, often are used in sizes ranging from &frac18;-inch to 2-inch diameters in quarter- or half-inch increments or less. On a typical shop floor, a facing tool may need to be used on a variety of such sizes. Known tools require substantial re-configuration when the facing tool is used to face different sized workpieces. In some cases, both the fixture that holds the workpiece as well as the cutting tool must be changed to accommodate the next workpiece size. This further necessitates additional parts for the facing tool which must be carried with the tool to the job site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is desired, therefore, to provide a facing tool that substantially reduces workpiece and cutting tool vibration while at the same time permitting a variety of workpiece sizes to be faced with less re-configuration of the facing tool. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a facing tool includes a fixture that securely holds a workpiece, and a fixture retainer that secures the fixture against axial and radial movement during a facing operation. In one embodiment, the fixture includes a two piece construction that allows a first piece to be swung away from the second piece to accommodate a variety of sizes of workpieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a facing tool includes a tool spindle that has a cutting tool insert mounted thereon wherein the cutting tool insert is positively loaded against of surface of the spindle to reduce vibration and movement of the tool during a facing operation. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the spindle is formed with number of recesses or pockets that can receive a cutting tool to allow for facing operations on different sized workpieces. Still a further aspect of the invention is the provision of a chip shield that deflects material removed by the cutting tool away from the workpiece during the facing operation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purposes of illustrating preferred embodiments of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting same, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the invention for a facing tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that includes a fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a cutting tool drive mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> securely holds a workpiece W (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) for facing and end thereof. Although the preferred embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to facing a tube end, such description is intended to be exemplary in nature for purposes of explanation and illustration. The present invention can be used to face a variety of workpieces including tubing, piping, fittings and so on. Any hollow cylindrical workpiece can be faced using the present invention provided that a proper fixture is used to hold the workpiece W in alignment with the cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the cutting tool assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a tool spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) and a cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (also referred to herein as a cutting tool insert) is securely mounted on the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a manner described hereinafter to minimize tool vibration. The spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> recesses or pockets (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) to permit more than one tool insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be installed on the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at different radial positions. This allows the same spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be used for facing a variety of workpiece sizes, as will be described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The drive mechanism <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is conventional in design and includes a motor drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a spindle position control <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The motor drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be any convenient drive device that imparts rotary motion to the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the motor drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is realized in the form of an electric tool motor such as model <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> available from Metabo. The motor drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be equipped with a variable speed control if so desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the spindle position control <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are disposed in a main housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is axially supported in the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and includes a shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that is supported by a pair of bearings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The bearings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are captured at opposite ends of a spindle collar <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by means of a press fit, for example. The collar <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is appropriately sized to slide freely within a central axial slide bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that extends through the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can thus freely rotate at high speed within the collar <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> while at the same time being axially movable by translational or sliding movement of the collar <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> within the bore <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Mounted on the outer surface of the collar <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a rack gear <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that cooperates with a pinion gear <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The pinion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is disposed in a gear housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that can be attached to or part of the main housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pinion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> supported in the gear housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at one end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>a and is attached to a control handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at an opposite end. The handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extends transversely from the main assembly and may include grips or other means for assuring easy positive manual rotation of the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A return spring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is captured between the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The spring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> applies a rotational bias to the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in a direction so as to draw the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> away from the workpiece W. Thus, in the absence of manual override, the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in a retracted position. It should be noted that although the preferred embodiment illustrates use of a manual spindle position control <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a mechanized position control could also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The rack <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can slide axially within a slot <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> formed in the main housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The slot <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> provides a first axial travel stop <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>a when the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is retracted by the spring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and a second axial travel stop <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>b to limit the distance that the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can travel towards the workpiece. Upon manual rotation of the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the pinion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> drives the rack <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> so as to displace the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> towards the workpiece (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). When the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is released, the spring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> returns the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the retracted position. In the preferred embodiment, twenty-four (24) degrees of rotation of the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> translates into one-eighth (&frac18;) inch axial travel of the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, from the zero position. In this embodiment, the zero position corresponds to a rack <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> position that is spaced a distance from the first stop <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be provided with indicia <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that informs the operator of how far the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is moving based on rotation of the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the released position and it will be noted that &ldquo;zero&rdquo; position <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is offset from the alignment mark <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Prior to a facing operation, the operator rotates the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so that the zero mark <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>aligns with the alignment mark <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the operator holds that position. A workpiece tube end is inserted into the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> until the tube end engages the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> cutting end. The workpiece is then clamped or secured in the fixture <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (as will be described herein). This zero position calibration is performed without the motor drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> running. In this manner, the operator knows that when the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotated to the zero mark <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in alignment with the reference mark <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is at the workpiece end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Any further rotation of the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> will cause the cutting tool to begin removing material from the workpiece, and the indicia <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be used to help control or monitor how much material is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The spindle shaft drive end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 3</cross-reference>) is a male hex shape, for example, that is inserted into a first end of a sleeve coupling <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The first end of the coupling sleeve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is a mating female hex shape that corresponds to the male hex shape of the spindle drive end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The spindle drive end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> slides freely in the sleeve coupling <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> over at least a length that corresponds with the maximum stroke of the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (as controlled by rotation of the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). The sleeve coupling <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is coupled at a second end thereof to a drive shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the motor drive <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and secured thereto with a brass tip set screw <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotatably driven by the motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> while also being able to be axially moved by rotation of the control handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The spindle shaft <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> rotates with the sleeve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> due to the mating male and female hex shapes, and the spindle shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can also axially slide within the sleeve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is fixed against axial movement by its pinned connection to the motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> drive shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is used to securely hold or clamp a workpiece during a facing operation. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a fixture is provided that can accommodate a wide variety of workpiece sizes with minimal changeover requirements when changing sizes. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a retainer assembly that rigidly secures the fixture against vibration and other undesirable axial and radial displacement during a facing operation. In this way, the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can securely hold the workpiece in proper alignment with the cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and permit easy size changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a first fixed clamp member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that is rigidly mounted on the main housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The clamp member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is attached to or integrally formed with a mounting plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) that is bolted or otherwise conveniently attached to the underside of the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. This positions the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generally near the tool end of the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and in square alignment therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> further includes a second clamp member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> that is pivotally attached to the first clamp member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as at a hinge joint <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The hinged connection of the first and second clamp members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> allows the second clamp <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to be swung freely to an open position such as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and a closed position such as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. With the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the open position, a workpiece can be positioned in the lower fixed clamp member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and then the second clamp member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is swung over top the workpiece and connected to the lower clamp member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. A cam operated latch device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> cooperates with a latch pin <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and can be used in a conventional manner to clamp the members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> together and about the workpiece W. The clamps <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> thus function as a holder for the workpiece W. A spring loaded release pin <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> can be used to assist separating the clamps <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> far enough to remove or insert a workpiece without having to fully open the holder in every instance. With or without the release pin <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, oftentimes simply releasing the latch <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will allow sufficient separation of the clamps <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to permit a workpiece to be inserted and/or removed from the fixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates and alternative embodiment for a mounting arrangement of the clamps <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the lower clamp <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is separate formed and attached to the mounting plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The pinned clamps <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> thus can be installed and removed as a single unit, and clamp size changeovers can be accomplished without having to remove the mounting plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Thus the mounting plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be rigidly installed on the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, or even integrally formed therewith if so required. The lower clamp <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is attached to the mounting plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by any convenient means such as bolts <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In order to allow the same fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to accommodate a variety of workpiece diameters, the first and second clamp members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can be equipped with collet inserts <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, b. </italic></highlight>These collets can be attached to their respective clamp members by any convenient means such as bolts or screws <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The collets <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be provided as a set to permit different size workpieces to be secured in the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by simply replacing collets having different radial dimensions. This permits the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be used to face a variety of sizes without having to remove the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, collets can be integrally formed in the clamp members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> if required for a particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Although the pivot connection between the clamp members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is particularly useful for flexibility in workpiece dimensions, it presents a site of possible vibration and movement of the workpiece during a facing operation. Although the lower clamp member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is rigidly affixed to the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the upper clamp member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is latched rigidly to the lower clamp member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by the latch device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, absent a restraint the collets could vibrate and move due to their extension type mounting to the bottom of the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> To avoid such undesired movement of the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the workpiece W, the upper or pivoting clamp member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> includes a fixture catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is mounted on or integral to a rearward surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the upper clamp member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. In the described embodiment the catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is positioned so that when the upper clamp member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is closed and secured with the latch device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is positioned generally near the top of the overall fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (it will be appreciated that positional references herein such as &ldquo;top&rdquo; and &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; are merely for convenience of reference to the illustrated views, it being understood that the facing tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be in practice oriented in any number of positions). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a fixture retainer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in the form of an arcuate plate is rigidly mounted on the main housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as by bolts <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) or other convenient means. The retainer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> extends axially beyond the forward end of the housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A retainer groove or slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) is provided at an outer peripheral edge of the retainer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. This retainer groove <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is formed with two arced radial ends <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, b </italic></highlight>with the radius of the arc being referenced to the hinge joint <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The fixture catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is formed with complementary arced surfaces <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that the catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> mates with and is captured in the retainer groove <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> when the upper clamp member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is in the closed and latched position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</cross-reference>). The complementary arced surfaces of the catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the groove <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> allow the upper clamp member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to be freely rotated to and from the closed position. The tolerances between the catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the groove <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> should be closely held so that the catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is prevented from radial displacement during a facing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the fixture catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> includes a flange <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that abuts a rear surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the fixture retainer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> when the upper clamp member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is in its closed position. The flange <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> thus prevents or substantially eliminates axial displacement of the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> away from the cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during a facing operation. The fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and workpiece W would otherwise tend to move axially away from the rotating tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is brought into engagement with the workpiece. The fixture catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and retainer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> thus cooperate to secure the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and workpiece W against undesired axial and radial movement or vibration during a facing operation by providing a rigid securement of the upper clamp member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to the main housing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The fixture retainer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be provided with a partial cutout <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to permit the operator to observe the facing operation. A clear shield <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> (shown in phantom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) such as made of plastic or other suitable material can be provided to cover the cutout <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to prevent chips and shavings from passing through the cutout <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A bench stand <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) can be used if so required to support the facing tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an elevated position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 4</cross-reference>, the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes an end face <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that is axially opposite the spindle drive end <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The spindle end face <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> preferably has a plurality of cutting tool receptors, recesses or pockets <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> formed therein. In the exemplary embodiment, the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provided with four tool pockets <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, although only a single one is required for a facing operation. The use of a plurality of pockets <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> permits a number of cutting tools <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be carried by the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> wherein different ones of the cutting tools <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are used to face respective workpiece diameters. Alternatively, a single cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can simply be positioned in the correct pocket <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for the size workpiece being machined. The combination of the pivoted clamp members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, collets <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and different cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> positions provide substantial flexibility in the range of sizes of workpieces that can be faced with little or no reconfiguration required of the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or cutting tools <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the described embodiment, using four tools <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with a single collet <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> or clamp <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> arrangement allows the facing tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to face &frac18;-inch to 2-inch diameter workpieces without having to change the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, tools <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in most cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, each cutting tool pocket <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is provided by forming a recessed axially oriented pocket wall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> end face. The axial wall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> adjoins transversely a radially oriented second pocket wall <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In the context of the pockets <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the terms &ldquo;radial wall&rdquo; and &ldquo;axial wall&rdquo; are simply points of reference with respect to the illustration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. For clarity the cutting tool inserts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are omitted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> cutting tool insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to fit with a comer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> thereof in a tool pocket <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A threaded hole <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed in the axial pocket wall <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and a corresponding hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extends through the cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The outer end of the tool hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is provided with a taper <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In order to rigidly and securely mount the tool insert <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the pocket <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the center line of the tool hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is slightly offset from the center line of the pocket hole <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In the drawing this offset is represented in an exaggerated manner for clarity and ease of illustration as an offset &ldquo;d&rdquo;. In practice, for example, the holes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be offset 0.0005 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A threaded tapered bolt <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (not shown for clarity of the illustrations) is screwed into and through the tool hole <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. For the bolt <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to further be threaded into the pocket hole <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is forced up against the pocket wall <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. This action places a positive load on the tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> against the wall <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to prevent tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> vibration and movement during a facing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, each cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a cutting knife edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> with a curved or radiused surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably made of T15 high speed tool steel, for example, with a titanium nitride coating. Other suitable tool materials can be used if required. The surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> provides a deflection path for metal chips and debris to direct the removed material away from the workpiece W. The cutting edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is angled as at <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to the horizontal centerline of the workpiece (or the clamping device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>). In the illustrated example, this angle is about 30 degrees (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Below the cutting edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> the tool surface is cut away at a relief angle <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). In the illustrated embodiment the relief angle is about two degrees. The off horizontal angle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of the cutting edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> gives the cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> a skiving or shaving action across the tube end as the tool is rotated. The relief angle <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> prevents the non-cutting surfaces of the cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from rubbing against the cut tube end. The combination of the radiused surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the skive angle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> directs the removed materials (chips and debris) toward the outside diameter of the workpiece and away from the tube end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Although the tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> design is effective for directing debris away from the workpiece, in some cases, for example, when the facing area has not been cleaned or when a large amount of metal is removed from the workpiece, debris and chips may tend to be directed back into the workpiece cylinder. This necessitates cleaning out this debris after facing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a chip shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be provided if required. A single shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is illustrated in the drawings, although two or more shields <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> could be used as required and as available based on the spindle and tool configuration. In the illustrated embodiments, each shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is associated with two cutting tool pockets <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 9</cross-reference>, the chip shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a vertical deflection face <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. This deflection face <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is positioned slightly axially behind the tool cutting edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and slightly radially spaced therefrom a distance large enough to allow debris and chips to come off the cutting edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, pass behind the shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and follow the radiused surface <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, as represented by the directional arrow A. The shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> will block chips and debris from being directed back toward the workpiece, as the deflection wall in essence covers the tool pocket <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> axially forward and between the tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the workpiece. A flange <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be provided on the shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to attach the shield to the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as by bolts <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may have a slot <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> for the bolts <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to permit some adjustment to the shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> position, to optimize the deflection of material away from the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An alternative mounting arrangement for the shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In this alternative, the chip shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> does not include a bent edge, but rather is a substantially planar device. An alignment hole cooperates with an alignment pin <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a screw <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is used to secure the shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> against a recessed flat <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> formed in the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Two such mounting flats are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In operation, the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is opened and a workpiece is inserted therein. The fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be loosely closed about the workpiece to permit adjustment of the axial position of the workpiece. The control handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotated to the zero position and held there while the workpiece or tube end is abutted against the cutting tool edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. At this time the operator can also check for proper alignment between the cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the workpiece wall. The workpiece is then rigidly clamped in the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by locking the latch device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. This also securely captures the fixture catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in the fixture retainer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The drive motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then turned on and the control handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> rotated to engage the cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the workpiece. The fixture catch <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and retainer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> substantially reduce or eliminate vibration of the workpiece to provide a better finished tube end. The chip shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> prevents debris from entering the workpiece. After the workpiece is faced the handle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be released so that the spring <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> retracts the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can then be opened and the workpiece removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> If the next workpiece is differently dimensioned, the operator can exchange the proper collet <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and can re-position the cutting tool <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a different tool pocket <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Where a plurality of tools <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are installed on the spindle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the tools <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will already be aligned with the end face of the respective size workpiece since the fixture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> holds a predetermined alignment of the workpiece to the cutting tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments. Modifications and alterations will occur to others upon a reading and understanding of this specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
