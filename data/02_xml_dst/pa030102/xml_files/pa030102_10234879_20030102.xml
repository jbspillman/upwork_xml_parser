<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an air in-line sensor for use in a medical device and, more particularly, to an air in-line sensor designed to detect air bubbles in a therapeutic solution flowing through a tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An infusion system for delivering a drug or other liquid into a patient often includes an infusion device that operates to deliver the liquid at an adjustable rate or dosage. Prior art infusion devices include an air detector using an ultrasonic or an optical sensor for detecting air bubbles in the liquid flowing through a tube. The air detector is loaded in a part of the tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Two types of the air detectors are known. More specifically, in the separate type as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> signal emitting member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a signal receiving member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the detector are separate components in such a structure. The signal emitting member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is mounted on a stationary unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a pumping station, while the signal receiving member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is carried by a movable unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, such as a door. When the door <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is closed, a channel <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is defined between an upper surface of signal emitting member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of stationary unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a lower surface of signal receiving member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of movable unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, into which a tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is accommodated. Accordingly, when movable unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is closed while tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is loaded into an upper recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> defined in signal emitting member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of stationary unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, tube <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is deformed into a flattened configuration within channel <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to provide an enlarged surface area in contact with signal emitting and receiving members <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the unitary type of the air detector as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, a tube-receiving groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is defined in stationary unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Both signal emitting and receiving members <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are embedded in opposing walls of groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The unitary type is mainly used for detecting relatively short air bubbles and therefore the length of tube-receiving groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is relatively short, exerting less resistance in contact between the groove and the tube. Accordingly, the tube may be fitted into groove <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by pushing with one&apos;s fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the above-described separate type, it is difficult to maintain a constant, specific distance between the signal emitting and receiving members so as to stabilize the performance of the detector, because the separate type sensor system has more tolerances than a unitary type system. When more tolerances are involved, distance control between the signal emitting and receiving members becomes more difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Nuisance alarms result when a pump alarm is activated when air is not present in the line. As a result, air sensors are often deactivated in the pump&apos;s configuration. Accordingly, the pump would not be able to detect the presence of air in the line. Moreover, nondetection of actual air in the tubing line occurs in many prior art infusion devices because the ultrasonic signal is not fully transmitted through the tube. For example, an ultrasonic signal may work its way around the bottom of the channel and trick the pump mechanism into believing that liquid is in the line when, in fact, air is in the line. This nondetection or &ldquo;short circuit&rdquo; is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Some unitary type air sensors have included a pocket underneath the channel to block the ultrasonic signal, and thus, prevent the ultrasonic signal from circumventing the correct path through the tubing set. However, these pockets can allow dirt and cleaning solutions to build up, which prevents the sensor from working properly. If the pocket became filled with liquid, the ultrasonic signal may travel around the channel even when air is present in the tubing line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Moreover, some unitary type air sensor systems do not maintain optimal contact between the tube and the channel. For example, if a flat closure member surface is utilized to push the tube into a V-shaped, upper section of the channel, the tube may become dislodged from the channel by rotational or rolling displacement of the tube. Additionally, the tube may flatten or collapse disproportionately, causing poor coupling between the tube and the channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,102,392, owned by Assignee of the present invention, discloses an air detector for use in infusion pumps (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>). The air detector utilizes a unitary type sensor for detecting air bubbles in the tube. The upper section of the groove has a first side wall which tapers upwardly and outwardly from the tube fixing section and a second side wall is perpendicular to the base of the groove along the length of the tube fixing section. When the door is closed after the tube is loaded in the groove, the tube abutting member forces the tube against the second side wall and into final position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention is provided to solve these and other problems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While this invention is susceptible of embodiments in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail preferred embodiments of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to the embodiments illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring now in detail to the Figures, FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> illustrate an air in-line sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for detecting air bubbles in a therapeutic solution flowing through a tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> located in a pumping mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extends from a supply bag of the therapeutic solution to a patient through sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for receiving tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a tube loading section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also has a signal emitting member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> positioned on one side of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a signal receiving member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> positioned on an opposite side of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further, sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a first air baffle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> positioned between signal emitting member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and signal receiving member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to prevent the ultrasonic signal from traveling around tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Preferably, pumping mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a peristaltic pump, a roller pump, an expulsor pump, a finger pump or a piston cassette pump. Pumping mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a stationary section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a movable section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> hingedly connected to stationary section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, movable section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is pivotable about its axis in a direction indicated by an arrow to close and open stationary section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Movable section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a blade <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having a radius of curvature <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for positioning tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in pumping mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Blade <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> pushes tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the proper position within channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In a preferred aspect of the invention, channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is U-shaped, and has substantially square corners having only a slight radius where base <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> meets first and second sidewalls <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, respectively. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the width <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is smaller than outer diameter <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This provides a large contact area between tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and first and second sidewalls <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a first lead-in section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a second lead-in section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to allow tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be easily loaded into pumping mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Each of the first and second lead-in sections <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, respectively, includes a V-radius and a channel draft for molding purposes. Channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a first lead-in section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> forming the upper portion of a first sidewall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. First lead-in section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> tapers upwardly and outwardly from an intermediate portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of first sidewall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to upper portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of first sidewall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In a preferred aspect of the invention, channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a second lead-in section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> positioned opposite first lead-in section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Second lead-in section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> forms the upper portion of a second sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Similar to first lead-in section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, second lead-in section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> tapers upwardly and outwardly from an intermediate portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of second sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the upper portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of second sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, blade <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has a radius of curvature substantially identical to the radius of curvature of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to maximize coupling of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and first and second sidewalls <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The curved blade allows tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be pushed down into channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a maximum amount of force imparted on first and second sidewalls <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, respectively, without distorting tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The pressure exerted on tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> causes the sides of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to expand horizontally and push against first and second sidewalls <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, respectively. Thus, tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is deformed from a circular configuration into an oval configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The greater the force of the sides of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on first and second sidewalls <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, respectively, and the greater the contact area of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and first and second sidewalls <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the greater the coupling between tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and thus, the greater the transmission of the ultrasonic signal through tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The higher coupling force increases the performance of air sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> An electronic circuit drives signal emitting member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which projects ultrasonic energy across channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the tube contents. Signal receiving member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> acts as a receiver. The strength of the ultrasonic signal passing through tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is highest when liquid is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Conversely, the strength of the ultrasonic signal is lowest when air is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The electrical circuit compares the strength of the detected signal and decides whether there is air or liquid in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and thus, whether to sound an air in-line alarm. When air passes through tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and thus, the transmission path, the ultrasonic energy is interrupted or decreased. Accordingly, the electrical circuit will output five (5) volts if liquid is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the electrical circuit will output zero (0) volts if air is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In a preferred aspect of the invention, sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a second air baffle <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> positioned between signal emitting member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and signal receiving member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Second air baffle <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is positioned opposite first air baffle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which prevents the ultrasonic signal from traveling around tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. First air baffle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> weakens the ultrasonic signal traveling through tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and thus, prevents a &ldquo;short circuit&rdquo; when high coupling forces are present between tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and first and second sidewalls <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the center of signal emitting and receiving members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the center of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are co-linear and parallel to channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is positioned within channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to allow these respective centers to align when tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is forced into channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to reduce manufacturing error. Proper align increases the strength of the signal transmitted through tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The width of channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is selected in conjunction with the dimensions of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to optimize the performance of air sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is made of an engineering resin, such as ABS plastic, and has a width of about 0.075 inches at its base. Preferably, the outer diameter of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is about 0.083 inches, and the inner diameter is 0.03 inches. The thickness of the U-channel material between tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the signal emitting and signal receiving members <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively, is critical, and, preferably, is 0.027 inches. The U-channel wall surface finish was also optimized to increase the coupling between the tubing set and the plastic U-channel walls. Preferably, the U-channel wall is made of a continuous plastic that is free of voids, glass and fillers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, an air in-line sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided for detecting air bubbles in a therapeutic solution flowing through tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has means for emitting an ultrasonic signal through tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the means for emitting is a transducer, such as signal emitting member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also has means for detecting the ultrasonic signal emitted through tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the means for detecting is a transducer, such as signal receiving member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further has means for preventing the ultrasonic signal from traveling around tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the means for preventing employs two air baffles, such as first air baffle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and second air baffle <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Air baffles <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are positioned between signal emitting member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and signal receiving member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also has means for measuring the strength of the ultrasonic signal emitted through tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the means for measuring is an electrical circuit. Moreover, sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has means for comparing the strength of the ultrasonic signal to a preset voltage value. Preferably, the means for comparing employs a voltage comparator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further has means for outputting a preset, maximum value if liquid is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a preset, minimum value if air is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the electrical circuit will output five (5) volts if liquid is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the electrical circuit will output zero (0) volts if air is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, the voltage comparator is set at 2.5 volts. A signal above 2.5 volts would cause the comparator to output 5 volts, and thus, indicate that liquid is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Conversely, a signal below 2.5 volts would cause the comparator to output 0 volts, and thus, indicate that air is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If air is present in tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, sensor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sounds an air in-line alarm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A method is disclosed for loading tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Preferably, channel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has first lead-in section <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and tube loading section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Signal emitting member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned on one side of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and signal receiving member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is positioned on an opposite side of tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Pumping mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided having stationary section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and movable section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Movable section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has blade <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having radius of curvature <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is positioned in channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and blade <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is placed in contact with tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When movable section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is closed, blade <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> positions tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in tube loading section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> While the specific embodiments have been illustrated and described, numerous modifications come to mind without significantly departing from the spirit of the invention, and the scope of protection is only limited by the scope of the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
