<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A thermal inkjet printer with firing nozzles perpendicular to the carriage motion has two motors: paper and carriage. These motors, alone or in concert, provide the power to the service station. The service station has separate wiping and pen cleaning functions. The wipers need to move across the pens in a direction that is perpendicular the carriage direction. Through the use of gears, the wipers can be made to clean the pens at the same time that the paper is being advanced and using the same motor source. For capping, the caps are moved into place as the pens come to rest. The motion of the pens themselves could easily push a lever that pushes the caps into place. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention is directed towards the field of thermal inkjet printers, particularly towards the pen maintenance thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The service station in any thermal inkjet (TIJ) printer is a sub-assembly that is designed to enhance the life of TIJ pens, along with ensuring its health. This is accomplished in several ways. A rubber blade that is passed over the firing orifices, cleaning them of excess ink, periodically wipes the pens. All the pens are periodically fired into a &ldquo;spittoon&rdquo;. This happens at several intervals, most notably when the &ldquo;dot-count&rdquo; reaches a certain value. This &ldquo;dot-count&rdquo; indicates that a set of the orifices within a pen have been fired a certain number of times, while other orifices within the same pen have not. The carriage is positioned over the spittoon and all the orifices are fired. This has the effect of ensuring the reservoirs maintain the appropriate level of pressure and fluidity and all the orifices do not clog or weep. The service station has a set of &ldquo;caps&rdquo; in it, one for each pen-head. During the times when the printer is not in use, the pens are positioned over the service station and the caps are moved to cover the firing heads. This protects the ink in the orifices from drying out during periods of non-use. The capping and wiping functions of the service station require motion in the service station with respect to the pens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For TIJ printers having firing nozzles that are parallel to the direction of the carriage motion, the motion required for wiping and capping is parallel to the direction of the pen movement on the carriage. These TIJ printers, e.g. Lexmark, use the motion of the pens across the paper, which is driven by a dedicated motor, to mechanically move their service stations, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. At the end of a print job, the pens move to the far right side of the printer where they hit a lever that moves the caps into place. When a new print job starts, the pens are moved to the extreme left of the printer. The start of this movement releases the capping switch and lowers the caps halfway, bringing the wipers into position. As the pens continue their motion, the orifices are wiped. After the final wiping motion is completed, the pen motion pulls the wipers into their &lsquo;rest&rsquo; position, out of the way of normal operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For TIJ printers having firing nozzles that are perpendicular to the direction of the carriage motion, e.g. Hewlett-Packard 800 and 900 series, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, all three of the pen servicing operations require applied motion. That motion is achieved by using a motor to maneuver the entire service station assembly. For multiple colors, the wiping function performed by the service station has an additional complication. The wiping function is performed parallel to the direction of the firing nozzles. If one wiper blade serviced multiple colors, when the same wiper surface area is passed over different color firing nozzles, as would happen if the wiping function is perpendicular to the direction of the firing nozzles, the ink supplies will become contaminated. The firing nozzles for each color are perpendicular to the direction of pen motion. Additionally, perpendicular TIJ printers provide an isolated space for the spittoon and move that spittoon into position. The isolation keeps the excess ink away from the other contents of the printer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a prior art service station for a perpendicular TIJ printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are two basic &ldquo;pen wipe&rdquo; motions: wick and flicker. The squeegee blade may have any topology ranging from short and stiff to long and flexible. In the wick wipe, the squeegee blade is slowly dragged across the pen head, trying to pull some wet ink from each nozzle in an attempt to dissolve dried ink. In the flicker wipe, the blade is rapidly drawn across the orifices to wipe excess ink from the pen. The excess ink on the blade must then be removed. This is typically done by wiping the blade across a fixed plastic section found on the edge of the service station sub-assembly. Because of these different types of operations, speed control of the squeegee is required. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a thermal inkjet printer with firing nozzles that deposit ink perpendicular to the direction of carriage motion, having two motors: paper and carriage. These motors, alone or in concert, provide the power to the drive train of the service station. Within the service station, the drive train is coupled to pen cleaning, e.g. wiper blade, and pen capping functions. The wiper blade moves across the pens in a direction that is perpendicular to the carriage motion. Through the use of gears, the wipers can be made to clean the pens at the same time that the paper is being advanced, using the same motor source. For capping, the caps are moved into place as the pens come to rest. The motion of the pens themselves could easily push a lever that pushes the caps into place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the paper motor powers the service station. A carriage motor is connected to a carriage via a gear-set and a belt-drive. The carriage moves along a guided track, propelled by the belt drive. The carriage includes one or more pens each containing dedicated firing nozzles. A paper path motor provides power to a feed roller via a first gear transmission. A paper pick-up transmission lifts the paper into position where a paper pick-up roller pulls the paper into the printer. A second gear transmission provides power to the paper pick-up transmission. The paper motor is coupled either directly or indirectly to the drive transmission within the service station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the carriage motor powers the service station. The carriage motor is connected to a carriage via a gear-set and a belt-drive. The carriage moves along a guided track, propelled by the belt drive. The carriage includes one or more pens each containing dedicated firing nozzles. A paper path motor provides power to a feed roller via a first gear transmission. A paper pick-up transmission lifts the paper into position where a paper pick-up roller pulls the paper into the printer. A second gear transmission provides power to the paper pick-up transmission. The axial motion of the carriage is transformed into perpendicular-to-axial motion for the wipers through a number of mechanical means, e.g. levers, gears, springs, or a combination thereof. The carriage motion may be used to raise and lower the pen caps also through a series of levers, gears, springs, or a combination thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a process flowchart corresponding to the prior art functionality of the printer. In step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the printer gains operational control of the job. In step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the pens are uncapped and wiped. In step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, paper is pulled into the printer. In step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the carriage is initialized. In step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the paper is advanced. In step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the carriage is moved and ink is spit onto the paper. Steps <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are repeated until the print job is complete. A new piece of paper is loaded without servicing the pens. The rest of the flow chart corresponds to when the last page is printed. In step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the paper is &ldquo;kicked&rdquo; from the printer, coming to rest in the out tray. In step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the carriage is moved to the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; position. In step <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, pens are wiped and capped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a service station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. Piece <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> would be the wipers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The wipers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> must move across the pens in a direction that is parallel to the direction that the paper moves to preserve the ink supply. Through the use of gears <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> connected to the paper rollers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the wipers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be made to clean the pens at the same time that the paper is being advanced, using the same motor source. Piece <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the service station capping function <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This function requires moving the caps into place as the pens come to rest. The motion of the pens themselves could easily push a lever that pushes the caps into place. A spittoon <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> collects the residual ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> One method for providing the &ldquo;wipe&rdquo; function is to mold a reinforced, ethylene, propylene diene modified co-polymer (EPDM) continuous belt, similar to a conveyer belt. The squeegee elements would be molded on to the outer surface of the belt. This &ldquo;squeegee belt&rdquo; is mounted on two rollers that contact the surface of the belt. One roller is an idler and the other is affixed to the drive roller. This assembly is placed on one side of the paper path. When a wipe is needed, the pen carriage moves the pens over the &ldquo;squeegee belt&rdquo;, the drive roller turns and the squeegee is moved across the orifice plate. Mounting the &ldquo;squeegee belt&rdquo; in this orientation provides the correct squeegee motion for pens that move perpendicular to the carriage axis. In one embodiment, the squeegee belt runs continuously, however a transmission may be provided to engage the &ldquo;squeegee belt&rdquo; upon demand (the pen carriage can trip the transmission when it is in position for a wipe. In this embodiment, the wipe cannot be done while paper is loaded in the drive roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> At the end of the print job, the pens come to rest at the right side of the carriage against a lever. This pushes the cap against the pens, sealing them from the atmosphere. At the start of a new print job, the pens move to the left of the printer where they wait for the paper to move into position. As they come to rest, they push a toggle that translates the horizontal motion of the carriage to a vertical wiping motion. After the wipe pass is complete, and the pen moves to print, the wiper is returned to its at-rest position, along with the toggle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The axial motion of the carriage can be transformed into perpendicular-to-axial motion for the wipers through a number of mechanical means, e.g. levers, gears, springs, or a combination thereof. The carriage motion may be used to raise and lower the pen caps also through a series of levers, gears, springs, or a combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a process flowchart corresponding to a thermal inkjet printer having a carriage motor that transfers power to the service station. In step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the printer gains operational control of the job. In step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, paper is pulled into the printer. In step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the pens are uncapped and wiped. In step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the carriage is initialized. Steps <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may occur simultaneously. In step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the paper is advance. In step <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the carriage is moved and ink is spit onto the paper. Steps <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are repeated until the job is printed. In step <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, the paper is &ldquo;kicked&rdquo; from the printer. In step <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, the pens are wiped and capped. In step <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, the carriage is moved into the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; position. Steps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> may occur simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Similar to the last embodiment, the wiping function can occur. The capping function may occur as follows. As the pens come to rest, they hit a transmission that causes the caps to be lifted as the paper is driven out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a process flowchart corresponding to a thermal inkjet printer having a paper motor coupled to the service station. In step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the printer gains operational control of the job. In step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the pens are uncapped and wiped. In step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, paper is pulled into the printer. Steps <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may occur simultaneously. In step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the carriage is initialized. In step <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, the paper is advance. In step <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, the carriage is moved and ink is spit onto the paper. Steps <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> are repeated until the job is printed. In step <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, the carriage is moved into the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; position. In step <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, the pens are wiped and capped. In step <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, the paper is &ldquo;kicked&rdquo; from the printer. Steps <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may occur simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment for the transmission assembly that transfers power from the paper motor to the service station. The carriage motor is used as a clutch to engage the gears while movement of the service station comes from the paper motor. The carriage pushes an idler into drive and loads the gears. The gears transfer power from the feed roller to the service station. The paper motor (not shown) powers the feed roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates an alternate embodiment for the transmission assembly. The drive gear, idler gear, and link are mounted to the drive shaft. When the carriage parks over the service station, the carriage pivots around the carriage slide shaft and tips back toward the service station. This rotation is caused by features in the top sheet metal carriage guide. This &ldquo;tipping back&rdquo; engages the idle gear by pushing down on the link when the carriage is over the service station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment for the transmission assembly. The feed roller runs a bidirectional slip clutch that is tied to the service station gear transmission. When the feed roller is powered forward (feeding paper), the service station is driven in the &ldquo;uncap&rdquo; direction until it hits the &ldquo;end of stop&rdquo;. At this point, the clutch slips, many pages are printed and the pen spits when needed. Upon print completion, the pen is moved into position over the service station and the feed roller motion is reversed. The service station is driven into the &ldquo;pen cap&rdquo; position. When the service station reaches the end of travel, pens are capped as the clutch slips. The DC motor may be driven beyond the required distance to ensure that the service station has reached the end of travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment for the transmission assembly. In this embodiment, the carriage motor is coupled to the service station. During printing, the drive gear does not rotate because it is held by friction and inertia of the service station drive train. It rides on the feed roller shaft (slips). Its teeth are meshed with the service station drive transmission gear. When the carriage towards the service station, it eventually contacts a pressure arm. This arm contacts a rubber ring on the back of the drive gear forcing it against the rubber piece. When sufficient force is applied, friction between the rubber and the drive gear causes the drive gear to turn, which in turn powers the service station drive train. The rubber needs to grip the shaft tightly. The angles on the rubber and drive gear can be such that when the gear is pulled tight, it helps the rubber bite into the shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment for the transmission assembly. The paper motor is coupled to the service station power by reversing the paper feed roller. When the paper feed roller is powered forward, a one way clutch prevents power from being transferred to the service station drive train. When the motor is reversed, the one way clutch grabs, engaging the service station drive train. The service station pinion drives the rack moving the service station out of pen park (pen cap). The service station continues until it reaches its end of travel at which point the software detects motor stall and the service station is in the spit position. Just before &ldquo;end of travel&rdquo; a feature on the shuttle activates (shifts) the toggle mechanism to reverse the shuttle drive direction. The next time the feed roller is reversed, the service station pinion drives the shuttle&apos;s rack into the pen cap position. &ldquo;End of travel&rdquo; is again reached, the motor stalls, the toggle shifts and the pen is capped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While the above illustrations depict embodiment where either the carriage or the paper motor transfers power to the service station, it will be apparent to those with skill in the art that the carriage and paper motors, in concert, may be used to transfer power to the service station. </paragraph>
