<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a combination flashlight and audio recorder assembly. The assembly resembles a conventional handheld flashlight, is lightweight, and allows its user to conveniently record voice messages while simultaneously inspecting dark areas using the flashlight component of the invention. The invention is especially applicable for use by professionals in the law enforcement, fire safety and industrial safety industries, as well as other professionals for inspections in dark areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The use of standard handheld flashlights, such as those commercially available under the trademarks &ldquo;Mag-Lite&rdquo; and &ldquo;Streamlight&rdquo;, is quite common in certain professional safety industries. Professionals working in these industries commonly perform inspections at, for example, crime scenes, homes, and industrial facilities. During an inspection, the professional is generally unable to effectively record the details of information gathered and will often wait until after the inspection is completed before writing down the information on paper. In some cases, important details of the inspection are simply forgotten or inaccurately described. In other cases, where the professional attempts to write down information at the time of the inspection, the procedure proves to be not only time consuming, but especially awkward and difficult. </paragraph>

The end diameter of the audio recorder casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably slightly smaller than the end diameter of the flashlight casing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such that the casing are frictionally secured to each other and form a water-resistant seal when joined together. An aluminum ring adapter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be included on the end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the audio recorder casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to enhance frictional attachment of these components. In an alternative embodiment, the ends of the casings <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> have complementary screw threads (not shown) which mate to removable join the casings together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the assembly housing further defines an enlarged head <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for protecting the bulb <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the flashlight, and an elongate handle portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having an outer diameter which is sufficiently small to be easily gripped by the user. In this embodiment, the outer diameter of the handle portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is between 3.5 and 4.5 cm. The overall length of the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably between 40 and 45 cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the audio recorder assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a main board <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a function keyboard <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a removable memory card <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> stored within an inner casing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The memory card <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is electronically connected to the main board <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a built-in condenser microphone <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to receive and store electric signals corresponding to sound messages delivered by a user through a small sound port <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the outer casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The function keyboard <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has manual switches <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>E which extend through respective openings <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>E formed with the inner casing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and are selectively actuated by the user to control playing/pausing, message recording, stopping, rewinding, forwarding, and message deleting. Preferably, the switches <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>E are covered by integrally-formed silicone rubber push buttons <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>E at respective openings <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>E in the outer casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The electric signals stored on the memory card <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> during recording are subsequently converted to sound waves and transmitted to the user during playback of the memory card <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> using a small built-in speaker <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> electronically connected to the main board <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The speaker <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent a free end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the audio recorder casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and is readily accessed by the user through a removable back cap <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the back cap <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is perforated to allow radiation of sound outwardly from the speaker <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The audio recorder assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably powered by one or more DC5.5V&plus;rechargeable Nickel Cadmium batteries (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> An electronic schematic of the main board <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The function keyboard <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and removable memory card <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are indicated in phantom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Upon assembly of the invention, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> metal spring <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> extending from the proximal end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the audio recorder casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> engages a rear battery <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the flashlight casing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to maintain the series of batteries <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in operative contact and to form a negative pole. A brass finger <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends outwardly from the audio recorder casing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adjacent the spring <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and engages the rear battery <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to form the positive pole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In an alternative application of the invention, the audio recorder assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is adapted for use as a retrofit item in combination with a standard handheld flashlight, such as those commercially available under the trademarks &ldquo;Mag-Lite&rdquo; and &ldquo;Streamlight&rdquo;. Such commercial flashlights typically have a removable back cap for conveniently inserting and replacing batteries. The back cap generally has a screw thread which mates with a complementary thread formed with an end of the flashlight. In this application, the audio recorder assembly has a threaded proximal end which is adapted to mate with the threaded end of the flashlight to operatively attach the audio recorder assembly and flashlight together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In addition, the digital memory card <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be removed from the audio recorder assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention and replayed in a separate playback unit (not shown). For this reason, it is not essential that the audio recorder assembly include a speaker or other audio playback means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A combination handheld flashlight and audio recorder assembly is described above. Various details of the invention may be changed without departing from its scope. Furthermore, the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention and the best mode for practicing the invention are provided for the purpose of illustration only and not for the purpose of limitation-the invention being defined by the claims. </paragraph>
