<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to interactive simulations, and more particularly to simulations and games including force or touch feedback to a joystick or multi-axis controller or input device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Interactive computer simulations and interactive video games often include a movable structure generally known as a joystick to provide inputs for the simulation or game. Oftentimes, the joystick is strictly an input device by which signals are conveyed to the processing unit of the computer. These joysticks do not provide any tactile or force feedback to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The Atari Hard Drivin&reg; video game provides one-dimensional force feedback to a steering wheel or a brake pedal. That is, during a game, torques are generated on the steering wheel which simulate those torques which would be experienced during, for example, cornering in a car. See also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,044,956. In a more general simulation context, control elements including force feedback are known in elaborate flight simulators costing many millions of dollars. Heretofore, there has been no multiple-degree-of-freedom joystick suitable for games and simulations and suitable for arcade and home use. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The interactive simulation system of the invention includes a computer or game display unit programmed with simulation rules. A control unit is connected to the computer and provides information and control signals to the computer to interact with the stored simulation rules and to receive information and control signals from the computer. A movable structure for movement in at least two degrees-of-freedom by an operator is interconnected to the control unit by means of actuators. A programmable unit processes signals and information from the computer to generate signals to drive the actuators so as to apply forces in the at least two degrees-of-freedom to the movable structure and thereby to the operator. The applied forces are based on internal programming within the programmable unit, events occurring in the simulation and movements of and forces applied to the movable structure by the operator. The system thereby provides continuous interaction among motion of and forces applied by the movable structure, the events in the simulation and forces applied to and applied by the movable structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the simulation system is an interactive video game and the programmable unit resides in the control unit. In this embodiment, the movable structure is a joystick with two degrees-of-freedom. The actuators include electric motors driving a low-friction, low-backlash transmission. The programmable unit includes integrated electronics for controlling feedback and modeling user interaction with the simulation or game. It is also preferred that information compression technology be used so that much smaller information sets can be processed and communicated while still achieving a desired experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> By providing touch or force feedback, the system of the invention more effectively involves the operator in the simulation or game. For example, in two-dimensional games such as flight simulators the present touch feedback is used to allow the player to feel the difference in performance between a small general aviation airplane and a high performance military fighter and to feel environmental forces such as air turbulence or updrafts. In this case the joystick, known as a PowerStick&trade;, will feel a variety of programmable effects including feeling &ldquo;stiffer&rdquo; or &ldquo;softer&rdquo; depending on which type of airplane is being &ldquo;flown&rdquo; by the simulation user. In three-dimensional games (which are just now becoming available) force feedback is particularly valuable because navigating in a three-dimensional environment is often difficult and the touch feedback provided by the invention will enable the user to feel objects which are being encountered and provide a real-time indication of where an object controlled by the user or player is. In games involving contact, such as fighting games, the invention simulates and displays to the operator&apos;s hand the feel of collisions with objects encountered during the game or simulation and interaction with terrains of different textures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The overall system of the invention is illustrated schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a movable structure such as a joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a programmable section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> need not be a part of the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; it could be separate or part of the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A general purpose digital computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such as a personal computer or game display unit is programmed with simulation or game rules. The output from the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is displayed on a video monitor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and provides information and control signals to the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to interact with the stored simulation rules and to receive information and control signals from the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The programmable unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> processes signals and information from the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and generates inputs to, and processes outputs from the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supports the movable structure or joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for two degrees-of-freedom motion with respect to the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also includes at least one button type switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for sending signals to the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown without its cover. The control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes electric motors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> along with angular rotation sensors <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The motors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> include shafts bearing capstans <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> responds to the angular orientation of capstan <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the sensor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> responds to the angular orientation of the capstan <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to generate signals for use by the programmable unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A cable transmission mechanism driven by the capstan <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is adapted to rotate the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about an axis <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, that is, left and right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Similarly, the capstan <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is adapted to rotate the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about an axis <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> so that it moves into and out of the plane of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> drum <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> cooperates with the capstan <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to effect rotation. This transmission system has low backlash and low friction. The sensors <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> provide an output proportional to angular orientation of the respective motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shafts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that information and control signals can pass in either direction between the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The programmable unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be included in the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> housing or may be part of the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> itself. The programmable unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> processes signals from the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> using internally stored rules and equations to generate signals to drive the motors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so as to produce forces with two degrees of freedom to the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to a user (not shown) operating the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The applied forces are based on internal programming within the programmable unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, events occurring in the simulation and movements of and forces applied to the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by an operator (not shown). The system therefore provides continuous interaction among motion of the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, events in the simulation and the forces applied to and applied by the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, another embodiment of the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is described. A motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through a linkage denoted generally at <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> rotates a shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> passes through an angular orientation sensor such as potentiometer or encoder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> causes a bracket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to move left and right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and engages a lower portion <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to cause the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to move left and right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The slotted bracket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is supported in bearings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a motor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> drives a linkage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which rotates a shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which passes through a potentiometer or encoder <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> causes a bracket <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to rotate as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> to cause the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to move into and out of the plane of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The bracket <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is supported by bearings <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, as the motors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are energized, the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven with two degrees-of-freedom, that is, left and right and in and out of the plane of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The rotational sensors <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> provide electrical outputs proportional to the angular orientation of their respective shafts. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the programmable unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shown as a circuit board <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which may include the motor control and signal processing electronics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> the programmable unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a microcontroller <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which communicates with the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) through a host connection <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The microcontroller <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is any suitable processor such as a digital signal processor (DSP) or RISC architecture processor for enhanced operation. Further, the system can be designed for an upgradable processor core, independent of I/O hardware. In addition, the possibility exists of changing the controller&apos;s executable code from the host computer. This flexibility opens up the opportunity to customize the operation of the device for specific host applications. The microcontroller <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> executes boot code upon start up that loads in default operating firmware from on-board non-volatile memory (or removable media, e.g., memory cards) and waits for a host command to begin execution, or to download operational software. The default operation code provides general force feedback, positional, and other functions. Code downloaded to the microcontroller <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> from the host computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be tuned for specific functions and/or characteristics. The downloaded code can either be native executable binary or pseudocode for an on-board interpreter. An interpreter implementation removes the need for the host to know what processor resides on the control unit. Amplifiers <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> drive the motors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> or the motors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. It is to be noted that currents in the drive motors can be used to determine torque which can also be inferred from strain gauges or other types of force/torque sensors (not shown) on drive cables or shafts. It should also be noted that the torque transmission can be a four-bar linkage as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a cable transmission illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or a belt or gear train. If desired for a particular application, a speed reduction can be built into the transmission to amplify the torque applied to the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In applications where space and motor size are not constrained, the motors <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be directly mounted onto shafts <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> without transmissions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An example of a game or simulation illustrating the technology of the invention disclosed herein will now be described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. The system of the invention has been integrated into an IBM Windows demonstration game which itself does not form a part of this invention. In this exemplary game, a character <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> fights his way through a series of different terrains to reach a treasure (not shown). The walking, running, jumping, squatting, punching and kicking of the character <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are controlled by movements of the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When, for example, the character <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> hits a patch of ice, the force being felt by the player goes to zero and can in fact use the motion and forces applied by the operator to further exaggerate the effect by actively getting out of the way of the operator to simulate sliding. On rough terrain, vibrations and pulses are felt by the game player in proportion to the objects encountered. If the character <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is jumping and hits a tree or other object, the player will feel the stiffness of the object through forces transmitted through the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When the button <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is depressed, the character <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> stops moving and kicks or punches as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Depending on the nature of the object being punched or kicked, and also depending on other events in the game, the forces experienced by the player will be different. Also, the velocity of the motions change the forces felt as they would in real fighting. Real physical models of the environment and objects encountered are programmed into the programmable unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so that feedback is virtually instantaneous and independent of the graphics update of the computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This architecture also makes the game fully interactive in which game outcomes unanticipated by the programmers occur based on the performance of the player. Because of the force feedback, the player is more actively involved in the game since the forces applied to the joystick <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> realistically simulate forces which would be felt by the character <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the game.</paragraph>
