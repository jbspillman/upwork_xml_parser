<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electrochemical analysis element that facilitates rapid and accurate quantitation of a specific component contained in a biological sample such as blood, sweat or the like, or food sample such as food raw material or food product from food industries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The biosensor disclosed in the Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No Hei 3-202764 is a known example of electrochemical analysis element that facilitates simplified quantitation of a specific component, that is, a substrate contained in a biological or food sample without necessitating dilution and subsequent stirring of a sample solution. The biosensor disclosed in this reference is produced by first forming an electrode system on an insulating base plate using screen printing method or the like and subsequently forming a reaction layer containing an oxidoreductase and an electron acceptor on the formed electrode system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This biosensor quantitates the substrate concentration in a sample by the following procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> First, dropping a sample solution on the reaction layer of the biosensor dissolves the reaction layer in the sample solution, which promotes enzyme reaction between the substrate in the sample solution and the oxidoreductase in the reaction layer. Upon enzyme reaction, the electron acceptor in the reaction layer is reduced. A voltage is applied across the electrodes of the sensor after a predetermined time to electrochemically oxidize the reduced electron acceptor. The substrate concentration in the sample is quantitated based on the oxidation current value across the electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The prior art electrochemical analysis element can readily determine the substrate concentration in a sample of several &mgr;l or more. However, such element has a drawback that it sometimes meets difficulties in making reliable measurement if the sample is very small in amount under several &mgr;l. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an electrochemical analysis element that enables reliable measurement of a trace amount of sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention comprises a sensor body having a hollow space which space is open at its both ends, an electrode system having a working electrode and a counter electrode and a reagent segment containing an enzyme, wherein the electrode system and the reagent segment are disposed on an inner wall of the hollow space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a preferred mode of the present invention, the working electrode is positioned to oppose to the counter electrode on the inner wall of the hollow space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another preferred mode of the present invention, the reagent segment further comprises an electron acceptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In still another preferred mode of the present invention, the reagent segment is disposed on the working electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When the sample is whole blood, an arrangement of a filter on at least one open end of the hollow space helps to filter red blood cells during passage of the whole blood through the filter. This eliminates inconveniences due to arrival and interference of red blood cells at the reagent segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Closure of both open ends of the hollow space with a resin film or aluminum laminate film can enhance reliable preservation of the reagents in the reagent segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a provision of a reagent segment containing glucose oxidase yields an electrochemical analysis element that can quantitate glucose in body fluids. A provision of a reagent segment containing cholesterol oxidase in combination with cholesterol esterase yields another electrochemical analysis element that can quantitate cholesterol in body fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While the novel features of the invention are set forth particularly in the appended claims, the invention, both as to organization and content, will be better understood and appreciated, along with other objects and features thereof, from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the following, the present invention will be described more specifically referring to preferred examples of the electrochemical analysis element. In the figures, common numeral numbers have been used for identical parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an external view of a representative electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a plan view of the element of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A cylindrical sensor body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made of an electrically insulating material has a cylindrical hollow space <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the center. On the inner wall of the hollow space, an electrode system having a working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a counter electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is disposed and leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which are connected to the respective electrodes are also formed. A reagent segment <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> containing an enzyme is formed on the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which are connected to the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the counter electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively, are protruding at the lead tip outside from the bottom of the sensor body to function as a lead connector <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or a lead connector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the reagent segment <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and an insulating layer for coating the lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have been omitted. Coating of the lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with an insulating layer is preferable in order to regulate the area of the working electrode. However, such insulating layer can be omitted. When omitted, the area from the portion corresponding to the lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> should function as an electrochemical working electrode. In this structure, it is preferable to form the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the same material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention may comprise a three-electrode system further including a reference electrode in addition to the working <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and counter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> electrodes disposed on the inner wall of the hollow space <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the sensor body in order to stabilize measurement accuracy of the element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The reagent segment <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> containing an enzyme may be positioned optionally if only it is located inside the hollow space; however, it is particularly preferred to dispose it on the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The hollow space <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the sensor body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may have an arbitrary shape and is not necessarily limited to cylindrical shape. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, respectively, show other examples of the electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the reagent segment <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has been omitted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an exploded view of the element of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> into a first part and a second part. The sensor body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is composed of a first part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The hollow space <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed by closing a semi-circular groove <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the second part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with the first part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connected thereto are formed on a plane opposed to the groove <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. An insulating layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for coating the lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is also formed on the same plane. For more accurate control of the area allowed for the working electrode to exhibit its action, the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be coated with the insulating layer around its periphery. In the groove <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the second part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the counter electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the lead <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> connected thereto are formed. The counter electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be disposed on the first part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned electrode system and leads can be disposed on the inner wall of the hollow space of the sensor body using a known method such as sputtering or the like. They may be formed by sputtering with the necessary portions being masked. Otherwise, unnecessary portions may be removed by means of laser trimming or the like after the whole area is sputtered. As an alternative, the electrode system and the leads may be formed by adhering an appropriate metal foil onto the sensor body by heating or ultrasonically melting the sensor body. In forming the leads and the electrodes, any known conductive material may be used. Examples of the material are carbon, silver, platinum, gold and palladium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The reagent segment may be arranged in the hollow space of the sensor body in the following fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> An aqueous solution containing an enzyme is dropped on the inner wall of the hollow space of the sensor body using a pipette or something like that and dried. Alternatively, the reagent segment may be formed by immersing the sensor in an aqueous solution containing an enzyme, followed by drying. Latter method enables uniform distribution of the reagent segment on the inner wall of the hollow space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention also permits formation of the reagent segment by dropping an aqueous solution containing a hydrophilic polymer in addition to an enzyme on the inner wall of the hollow space of the sensor body, followed by drying. The hydrophilic polymer enhances adhesion of the reaction layer onto the inner wall of the hollow space. Examples of such hydrophilic polymer may be carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethylethyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyamino acids such as polylysine, polystyrene sulfonate, gelatin and its derivatives, polyacrylic acid and its salt, polymethacrylic acid and its salt, starch and its derivatives, or a polymer of maleic anhydride or its salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention also permits further inclusion of an electron acceptor in the reagent segment if occasion demands. The electron acceptor may be exemplified as ferricyanide ion, p-benzoquinone and its derivatives, phenazine methosulfate, methylene blue, or ferrocene and its derivatives. One or more of those electron acceptors are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it is preferable for the electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention to have a filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> adhered to the upper open end of the hollow space <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which open end will be used as a sample supply port. The filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> filters red blood cells when whole blood sample passes therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention also allows to cover both open ends of the hollow space <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made of a sealing material. Although this structure requires removal of the film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at use of the element, provision of the film yields an improving effect on the reliable preservation of the reagents contained in the reagent segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the following, operations of the electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> First, a sample solution containing a specific component (substrate) is supplied in the hollow space <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the sensor body from one open end of the hollow space. Upon supply of the sample, the reagent segment containing an enzyme dissolves in the sample solution and the substrate contained in the sample solution selectively reacts with the enzyme in the reagent segment. As a result, oxidation of the substrate by the enzyme proceeds and oxygen present in the sample solution is reduced to hydrogen peroxide. Subsequently an appropriate voltage is applied onto the electrode system and the hydrogen peroxide formed is oxidized. Response current flowing across the electrode system during this oxidation reaction is proportional to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide produced, that is, substrate concentration in the sample solution. Therefore, the substrate concentration in the sample can be determined by simply measuring such response current value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Preliminary impregnation of the reagent segment with some appropriate electron acceptor should produce a reduced form electron acceptor upon enzyme reaction, in place of production of hydrogen peroxide. Subsequently, an appropriate voltage is applied onto the electrode system and the reduced form electron acceptor is oxidized. Response current flowing across the electrode system during this oxidation reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reduced form electron acceptor produced, that is, substrate concentration in the sample solution. Therefore, the substrate concentration in the sample solution can be determined by simply measuring such response current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If the electrode system is arranged on a plane and the amount of available sample solution is very small, resistance against inter-electrode charge transfer, mainly ion transfer increases. This may sometimes produce variations in the measurement results. As shown above, the electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention enables an opposed arrangement of the working electrode to the counter electrode on the inner wall of the hollow space of the sensor body. This arrangement can smooth inter-electrode ion transfer, thereby increasing the accuracy of measurement. Smaller sizes of the hollow space of the sensor body facilitate supply of a sample solution onto the electrode system by capillary phenomenon, by simple placement of the sample on one open end of the hollow space. Therefore, the electrochemical analysis element of the present invention enables measurement of even a trace amount of sample with high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the electrochemical analysis element of the present invention quantitates a specific component in a sample by supplying the sample onto the electrode system disposed in the hollow space of the, sensor body. A method for sampling blood or the like from the body may be to press one open end of the hollow space of the sensor body against the skin surface of the host to damage the skin by actuating the body fluid leaking instrument from the other open end of the hollow space. The blood bleeding from the damaged site is then conveyed to the hollow space directly from the open end in contact with the skin. The body fluid leaking instrument may be laser beam emitting device, lancet or something like that. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the below-described examples, the sensor body is cylindrical and the sensor body accommodates only one sensor. However, the electrochemical analysis element in accordance with the present invention is not limited to the above shape and number of sensor. For example, the sensor body may be a band-like extended insulating member having plural holes penetrating up and down which are arranged along the length of the sensor body to form the electrode system in each hole, that is, hollow space. This structure can produce a sensor body which includes a plurality of analysis elements. Otherwise, the sensor body may be an insulating disc member having plural similar holes penetrating up and down which are arranged like a circle along the periphery of the disc. This structure also produces a sensor body having a plurality of analysis elements. As such, when plural elements are combined, it is preferable to design an optimal arrangement of the electrode leads of the respective elements and their connections to the forming measurement device to allow free selection of a specific element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the following, the present invention will be described by means of specific examples of electrochemical analysis element. However, the present invention is not limited to those examples. In the figures used in explaining each example, common elements were designated by the same numerals and, if appropriate, explanation has been omitted partially. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a counter electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and another lead <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> each made of a platinum material were formed on the inner wall of a hollow space <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a sensor body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of sputtering. On the lead <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an insulating layer was adhered by heat-melting an insulating polymer thin film. An aqueous solution of glucose oxidase (hereinafter abbreviated to &ldquo;GOD&rdquo;) was dropped on the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and dried to form a reagent segment <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In this way, an electrochemical analysis element of Example 1 was produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The element was evaluated for its response characteristics in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An aqueous glucose solution as a sample solution was supplied from an upper open end of the hollow space <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is, from the side opposite to the side disposed with lead connectors <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Thirty seconds after supply of the sample solution, a voltage (&plus;0.7 V) was applied onto the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, taking the counter electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as standard. The current flowing 5 seconds after voltage application was measured. The current value measured here was proportional to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide produced upon enzyme reaction, that is, glucose concentration in the sample solution. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, counter electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and insulating layer for coating the leads <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> were formed in the same manner as in Example 1 except for the use of carbon material in place of platinum material and the use of printing method in place of sputtering method. On the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an aqueous solution containing GOD as an enzyme and potassium ferricyanide as an electron acceptor was dropped and dried to form the reagent segment <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mainly composed of glass fiber was also provided to make contact with an upper open end of the hollow space. This gave an electrochemical analysis element of Example 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An aqueous glucose solution was supplied to the element in the same manner as in Example 1 but via the filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and response characteristics of the element was evaluated. The result showed that the glucose concentration was proportional to the response current as measured. Next, whole blood was supplied to the element as a sample via the filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the response characteristics of the element was evaluated. The filter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> filtered red blood cells during passage of the supplied whole blood therethrough and only plasma reached the reagent segment <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The reagent segment <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> dissolved in the plasma and glucose in the plasma was oxidized by GOD. At that time, ferricyanide ions in the reagent segment were reduced to form ferrocyanide ions. Thirty seconds after supply of the whole blood, a voltage (&plus;0.5 V) was applied onto the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to oxidize ferrocyanide ions, taking the counter electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as standard. The current flowing 5 seconds after voltage application was measured. The current value measured here was proportional to the concentration of ferrocyanide ions produced by oxidation of ferricyanide ions, that is, concentration of glucose in the blood. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A similar electrochemical analysis element was produced in the same manner as in Example 2, except for the use of cholesterol oxidase in combination with cholesterol esterase in place of GOD. This element was used to attempt quantitative analysis of the total concentration of cholesterol ester and free cholesterol (hereinafter abbreviated to &ldquo;total cholesterol&rdquo;) in whole blood. Blood cholesterol ester produced free cholesterol by the catalyst reaction of cholesterol esterase. The free cholesterol thus produced was oxidized together with such free cholesterol that is originally present in the whole blood. At that time, ferricyanide ions in the reagent segment were reduced to form ferrocyanide ions. Three minutes after supply of whole blood, a voltage (&plus;0.5 V) was applied onto the working electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to oxidize ferrocyanide ions, taking the counter electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as standard. The current flowing 5 seconds after voltage application was measured. The current value measured here was proportional to the concentration of ferrocyanide ions produced by oxidation of ferricyanide ions, that is, total cholesterol concentration in the blood. </paragraph>
