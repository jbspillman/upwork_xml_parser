<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Disadvantages relating to ink refill specific to an increase in a number of ink ejection openings in an ink jet print head is eliminated to provide a particularly excellent fast-response capability and ejection performance. More specifically, when an ink is supplied to a liquid chamber via an ink supply path and an ink supply opening formed in a support member and a print element substrate in a print head, and is then ejected from ejection openings, a pressure of an ink effected upon the ejection is transmitted to the ink supply path. This pressure, however, can be absorbed by air chambers via communication paths to reduce adverse effects of the pressure on ink refill in the liquid path after the ejection. In this case, since the air chambers and other components are structured to be closed with respect to the atmosphere, problems such as an increase in viscosity which are associated with communication of the air chambers and other components with the atmosphere can be prevented. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is based on Patent Application Nos. 11-236279 filed Aug. 24, 1999 in Japan and 11-236994 filed Aug. 24, 1999 in Japan, the content of which is incorporated hereinto by reference. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a print head and an ink jet printing apparatus for using the print head, and particularly to a configuration for ink refill that is carried out in liquid paths of the print head in associated with ink ejection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention is applicable to general printing apparatuses, apparatuses such as copy machines, facsimile machines having a communication system, and word processors having a printing section, as well as industrial printing apparatuses combined with various processing apparatus in a compound manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventional printing apparatuses for printing data on printing medium such as a paper, a cloth, a plastic sheet, an OHP sheet or the like (hereafter simply referred to as &ldquo;printing paper&rdquo;) are provided in a form of using a print head of various printing methods, for example, a wire dot method, a thermal-sensitive method, a thermal transfer method and an ink jet method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The ink jet printing method carries out printing by ejecting an ink from fine openings for ink ejection (hereafter referred to &ldquo;ejection openings&rdquo;) of a print head and depositing the ink on printing paper in accordance with printing information. This method has various advantages of enabling printing at a relatively high speed and enabling printing on plain paper easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition, the ink jet method can be roughly classified depending on an ink droplet forming method and an ejection energy generating method into the continuous method (including a charge grain control method and a spray method) and a on-demand method (including a piezo method, a spark method, and a bubble jet method). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The continuous method is what ejects continuously a charged ink and controls electric fields to deposit only required ink droplets on printing paper. Also, the method collects in an ink receiver part of the ink which is not required for printing. In contrast, the on-demand method is what ejects an ink as required for printing and thus efficiently uses the ink while avoiding ejecting an unnecessary ink to prevent an inside of the apparatus from being stained. On the other hand, the on-demand method employs an ink ejection operation basically including a start and a stop operations of an ink flow, and thus has a lower response frequency for driving of the head than the continuous method. Thus, a number of ejection openings is increased to improve a printing speed as a whole. Based on above points, many of the currently available ink jet printing apparatuses are based on the on-demand method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A printing apparatus of such an ink jet method has a printing head that comprises ink ejection openings, liquid paths each in communication with a corresponding one of the ink ejection openings and ejection energy generating elements for generating energy in the corresponding liquid path to eject the ink. To carry out printing, the ejection energy-generating element is allowed to generate ejection energy to act on the ink in the corresponding liquid path to generate a pressure therein for ejection, so that the pressure is then used to eject the ink from the ejection opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The ink used for the ink jet printing is commonly a printing agent such as a pigment or a dye which is dissolved or dispersed into a solvent such as water, a water-soluble organic solvent, or a non-water-soluble organic solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In an ink ejection operation performed in the print head described above, the pressure generated for ejection is transmitted via the ink in the liquid path both toward the corresponding ejection opening for ejection and toward a liquid chamber that supplies the ink to the liquid path. A part of the pressure which is transmitted toward the ejection opening pushes the ink in the liquid path out from the ink ejection opening to form a flying droplet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> When ejected ink leaves the ink ejection openings in a form of droplet, a meniscus which is formed in the liquid path near the ejection opening moves back depending on an amount of the ejected droplet. A tension of the ink (capillary force) which pulls back the meniscus toward the ejection opening causes a filled state of the ink in the liquid path to be returned to that before the ejection after a certain amount of time has passed. This phenomenon is called &ldquo;refill&rdquo;, and in actual printing, the above operation is repeated to achieve appropriate refill to enable stable persistent ink ejection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The refill, however, may fail to be completed before the next ejection due to a cause associated with an ejection frequency or the like, and this incomplete refill may result in inappropriate ejection such as a reduced amount of the ejected ink droplet. As a result, for example, a size of ink dots formed with the ejected ink droplet on a printing medium is reduced to degrade general printing quality and an accuracy with which the ejected ink droplets land on the printing medium, causing blurred, rumpled, striped, or whitened images to be printed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In printing techniques such as the ink jet printing method which use liquids, the above described problem has been solved by improving structures such as the liquid path or adjusting physical properties of the ink. Mere such improvements or adjustments, however, often fail to sufficiently improve a print head with a large number of ink ejection openings. This problem will be described below with reference to drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</cross-reference> are views showing cross sections of main parts of an ink jet print head as seen from an ink ejection direction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</cross-reference> is a view useful in explaining a pressure caused upon ink ejection and acting toward a common liquid chamber, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</cross-reference> is a view useful in explaining a pressure required to obtain an appropriate refill state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A print head <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a large number of ejection openings (not shown), liquid paths <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> each in communication with a corresponding one of the ejection openings, ejection energy generators <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> each disposed in a corresponding one of the liquid paths <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for supplying an ink to each of the liquid paths. The common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is in communication with an ink tank (also referred to as an &ldquo;ink cartridge,&rdquo; not shown) via an ink supply port <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and is thus constantly filled with the ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>A, when the inks are ejected from the large number of ink ejection openings <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> simultaneously or with a delay between ejection timings, a pressure caused by the ejection in each of the liquid paths <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is transmitted therefrom toward the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. These pressures are integrated together in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to form a single high pressure. The pressures caused in each liquid path act as forces that push back the ink toward the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as shown by an arrow A, and the sum of these forces is several times as large as that in a print head with a single ejection opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In this case, to obtain a proper refill state, a large amount of ink must be rapidly moved toward the ejection openings <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as shown by an arrow B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>B, and to change the ink movement direction in this manner, a pressure is required which is sufficient to overcome an initial strong inertia force (total pressure) of the ink such as that described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> However, a capillary force of the ink which causes the refill in each liquid path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is insufficient to instantaneously move a large amount of ink toward the ink ejection openings <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> against the total pressure toward the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. That is, as the above described initial inertia force during the ink movement increases, a larger amount of time is required to allow a meniscus <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to recover. Then, if the ejection frequency is reduced to allow for the sufficient amount of time for the meniscus recovery, a printing speed will decline. On the other hand, if a sufficient amount of time cannot be allowed for the meniscus recovery, printing will be inappropriate, for example, a predetermined amount of ejected ink droplets are not obtained, as described above. In particular, such a phenomenon is known to be particularly significant at the beginning of printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</cross-reference> are diagrams useful in explaining a mechanism of the above-described phenomenon. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a meniscus move back curve, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a general configuration of the ink ejection opening and its neighborhoods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The amount of meniscus move back (L&mgr;m) indicated on an axis of ordinate in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</cross-reference> is expressed in terms of a length L measured from an end of the ejection opening <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in the liquid path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>B, and particularly corresponds to a distance between the ejection opening <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the furthest point to which the meniscus has receded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> For example, in the print head with a single ejection opening, the meniscus <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> formed in the liquid path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> near the ink ejection opening at a point of time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&prime;, which is a point of time after a certain amount of time from a point of time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> when energy from the ejection energy generator <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is applied to the ink in the liquid path <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, that is, at the point of time when ink ejection is performed, rapidly starts to recede, as shown by the curve labeled CM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</cross-reference>. The amount of move back reaches its maximum value at a point of time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; and this value is relatively large. Subsequently, a recovery force based on the capillary force causes the meniscus <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to return to its original position, and refill is completed at a point of time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, in the print head with a large amount of ink ejection openings, as shown by a curve CM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the maximum amount of move back at t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is smaller than that in the above described case, whereas a refill speed is lower as indicated by a move back completion time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> This is because the sum of pressures that push the ink from the large number of liquid paths <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> backward substantially exceeds the pressure that allows the ink to flow in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and because a portion of the sum which exceeds the latter pressure acts on the ink to significantly reduce the initial refill speed at which the meniscus <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> recovers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Such a phenomenon is unlikely to occur after continuously repeated ejection because a steady flow of the ink from an ink supply tube <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A, 20B</cross-reference>) to the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has been formed. However, it is significant at the beginning of ejection, particularly, significant between the start of the ejection and a time at which about 200 times of ejection operation are performed to cause the ink flow to become steady. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this case, the decrease in refill speed in the print head <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with the large number of ink ejection openings <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as described above poses no problem when a period used to apply a printing signal to the ejection energy generator <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is set to be longer than the period between the points of time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</cross-reference>. However, when a subsequent signal is applied in a period shorter than the period between the points of time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the refill has not been completed, for example, when the amount that the meniscus has receded is still 30 &mgr;m or more for high-speed printing, a decrease in the amount of ejected ink droplets or the like may occur as described above to prevent proper printing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Known means for solving these problems include a configuration provided with an open section to atmosphere in the common liquid chamber near the liquid path to absorb the pressure acting toward the common liquid chamber during ink ejection, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,578,687. In this configuration, however, the common liquid chamber is open to the atmosphere, so that solvent components of the ink evaporate to make the ink in the print head more viscous or precipitate solids within the ink to block the liquid path and the ejection opening, resulting in frequent improper printing. Furthermore, vibration or the like may cause bubbles to be generated in the liquid chamber or a special design may be required to prevent dust or the like from entering the print head through the atmosphere open section. Therefore, this configuration is insufficiently practical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the ejection energy generating elements such as an electro-mechanical converting element and an electro-thermal converting element (thermal energy generation resistor), which are well known, are put in practical use in an ink-jet printing. Among them, a bubble jet method using the electro-thermal converting element, which heats a liquid contacting thereto so as to evaporate the liquid for making the bubble during extremely short time, shows a following behavior of the ink with respect to the refill. A part of the liquid (mainly the liquid disposed in an ejection opening side of a liquid path including the electro-converting element) is pressed to move towards the ejection opening and other liquid in the liquid path is pressed to move towards an ink supply path. The bubble forms an interface between a liquid and a gas on the above behavior. Accordingly, when continuous ink ejection is performed, generation and disappearance of the bubble at a high frequency cause a movement of the liquid. Many proposals such as providing a dummy nozzle and a dummy hole have been made with respect to the refill in order to dissolve a problem of the high frequency vibration of the liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as an ejection method of the bubble jet method, two kinds of ejection methods are known. Respective behaviors of the refill will be explained as follows, correspondingly to respective ejection methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> (Move Back and Return of the Meniscus in an Ordinary Ejection Method of the Bubble Jet Method) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Upon a process in which a liquid droplet is formed from the liquid and is ejected, a front surface of the liquid remaining in a nozzle forms the meniscus. Upon a process in which the bubble is disappeared, the meniscus formed at the front surface of the liquid is moved back in a retracting manner by an action of the disappearance of the bubble. At the same time, the interface between the gas and the liquid, which is formed as a back boundary part of the bubble, is moved towards the front also by the action of the disappearance of the bubble. That is, the process of the disappearance of the bubble per se functions as a part of driving force for making the interface positioned at the back of the electro-thermal converting element and the liquid contacted thereto return to the front of the nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> (Move Back and Return of the Meniscus in an Ejection Method of so Called Bubble Through Jet Type) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> This method is featured that the bubble generated by the thermal energy caused by the electro-thermal converting element communicates with an air before the liquid droplet is ejected from the nozzle. Accordingly, the process for disappearance of the bubble described above does not exist and the interface between the gas and the liquid as back boundary part of the bubble forms the meniscus which has been moved back. At a front of the meniscus moved back, an area of the air, whose pressure is substantially the same as that of atmosphere, is formed. The meniscus returns to the front of the nozzle with pressing the air (having substantially the pressure of the atmosphere). According to a consideration with respect to a printing head having the liquid path of the same dimension to the printing head of the ordinary ejection method, since the action accompanied with the disappearance of the bubble does not exist when the meniscus returns to the front, the refill is performed by a capillary force of the liquid path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Following two prior arts are known as arts regarding ink supply in the printing head of the above described bubble jet type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 10-305592 (1998) discloses relatively large chamber provided for receiving fine bubbles which is disposed around an ink supply path. Fine bubbles separated from the bubble for ejection become so many in a liquid chamber and then ejection failure may be caused. An ordinary method performs a suction recovery operation for preventing the ejection failure due to the fine bubbles from being caused. In contrast, the prior art provides the large chamber for receiving the fine bubbles. The chamber has only the liquid therein at beginning of use of a printing head. Then, the fine bubbles increase in the chamber with use of the head and when the chamber is filled with the fine bubbles the head integrally having an ink tank is exchanged by new one for preventing the liquid supply path from receiving the fine bubbles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 6-210872 (1994) discloses that an air chamber (a buffer chamber) is provide at an opposite and back side to nozzles with respect to a common chamber. Providing the buffer chamber near the nozzles allows a vibration (high frequency vibration) of a liquid caused by driving for ejection, generating the bubble and ejection of the respective nozzles to be decreased so as to prevent ejection of other nozzle from being affected. That is, the prior art discloses prevention of a crosstalk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The prior art also discloses that a head unit, a ink supply tube for supplying ink to the head unit and an air chamber formed at a connection portion between the head unit and the ink supply tube are provided along a path from an ink tank section to a head section. Especially in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> of the prior art, the air chamber is formed around the ink supply tube having constant section area. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> wherein a gas retaining chamber retaining a gas is disposed at a position capable of receiving a component of liquid movement of a different direction, which is caused by the inclined portion of the liquid supply path, from a direction of liquid supply. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> the printing operation is performed. In this printing operation, the print data sent from the external I/F is stored temporarily in the print buffer. Then, the CR motor E<highlight><bold>0001</bold></highlight> is started to move the carriage M<highlight><bold>4001</bold></highlight> in the main-scanning direction. At the same time, the print data stored in the print buffer E<highlight><bold>2014</bold></highlight> is transferred to the print head H<highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> to print one line. When one line of the print data has been printed, the LF motor E<highlight><bold>0002</bold></highlight> is driven to rotate the LF roller M<highlight><bold>3001</bold></highlight> to transport the paper in the sub-scanning direction. After this, the above operation is executed repetitively until one page of the print data from the external I/F is completely printed, at which time the processing moves to step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the LF motor E<highlight><bold>0002</bold></highlight> is driven to rotate the paper discharge roller M<highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> to feed the paper until it is decided that the paper is completely fed out of the apparatus, at which time the paper is completely discharged onto the paper discharge tray M<highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Next at step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, it is checked whether all the pages that need to be printed have been printed and if there are pages that remain to be printed, the processing returns to step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the steps S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are repeated.

<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In the print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, a plurality of print elements, a plurality of ink flow passages and a plurality of ejection openings H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>T corresponding to these print elements are formed by a photo-lithographic technology, and ink supply ports open on the back surface of the substrate. The print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is, for example, of a side shooter type and constituted by a single substrate. In this substrate, the plurality of ejection openings H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>T arranged in two rows in a zigzag manner are formed at approximately 1200 dpi for the individual color, and ejecting different colored ink respectively. A preferable ejection method used for the present invention is a method such that, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>H, a bubble <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> generated by thermal energy caused by an electro-thermal converting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> communicates with an atmospheric air and then an ink droplet is ejected from an ejection opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The method is so called &ldquo;bubble through jet method.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> consists, for example, of an Si substrate H<highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> with a thin film formed on the surface thereof and an orifice plate H<highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> formed on the substrate H<highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> For example, the substrate <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> has a thickness in a range from 0.5 to 1 (mm), and six rows of ink supply ports <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> in a form of an elongate groove-like through-hole are integrally formed in parallel to each other as flow passages for six color inks. A mutual distance between the ink supply ports H<highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> adjacent to each other is, for example, about 2.5 (mm). Since the mutual distance is relatively small, it is possible to design the print head small in size. On each of opposite sides of the respective ink supply port H<highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, a row of electro-thermal transducer elements H<highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> used as print elements for the individual colored ink are arranged in a zigzag manner relative to those in another side row, for example, at approximately 1200 dpi. </paragraph>

Also, an electrode section H<highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> for supplying electric power to the electric wiring is formed along each of opposite edges defined in the direction vertical to the arrangement direction of the electro-thermal transducer elements H<highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. In the electrode section H<highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, a plurality of bumps H<highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> of gold or the like are arranged in correspondence to electrode terminals H<highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> in the above-mentioned electric wiring board H<highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The ink supply port H<highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> is formed, for example, by an anisotropic etching method while using crystal face orientation of the Si substrate H<highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>. If the crystal face orientation is &lt;100&gt; along the wafer surface and &lt;111&gt; in the thickness direction, the etching proceeds at an angle of approximately 54.7 degrees(a rising interior angle of face being etched) by the anisotropic etching method using alkaline series (such as KOH, TMAH or hydrazine). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The ink supply port H<highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> is formed by etching the substrate at a desired depth according to this method. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> The six rows of ejection openings H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>T corresponding to the individual six color inks supplied from the respective ink supply ports H<highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> are integrally formed in a single orifice plate H<highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>. The plurality of ejection openings H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>T in the respective row are arranged, for example, at approximately 1200 dpi for every individual colored ink in a zigzag manner similar to the arrangement of the electro-thermal transducer elements H<highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>.namely, ejection openings H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>T is provided as opposed to the electro-thermal transducer elements H<highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Accordingly since the rows of electro-thermal transducer elements H<highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> and ejection openings H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>T are formed on the same print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> so that the six kinds of ink can be ejected, it is possible to design the print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> to be smaller in size than in the prior art wherein a row of ejection openings for the respective ink is separately provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The first plate H<highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference> is made, for example, of alumina (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) to have a thickness in a range from 0.5 to 10 (mm). It should be noted that material for the first plate is not limited to alumina but may be any of materials provided it has a linear thermal expansion coefficient equal to that of material for the print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> as well as a thermal conductivity equal to that of material for the print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> or more.

The six ink supply ports are arranged in a zigzag manner. Six ink supply ports H<highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> of the print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> are positioned in correspondence to the six ink supply ports H<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> of the first plate H<highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, respectively, and the print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is fixedly adhered to the first plate H<highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> at a high positional accuracy. A first adhesive H<highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> used for the adhesion is coated on the first plate H<highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> generally in a shape of the print element substrate while taking care not to generate air path between the ink supply ports adjacent to each other. The first adhesive H<highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> preferably has a relatively low viscosity capable of forming a thin adhesive layer on a contact surface, a relatively high hardness after being cured, and a high resistance to ink. The first adhesive H<highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> is, for example, a heat-hardening adhesive mainly composed of epoxy resin, and a thickness of the adhesive layer is preferably 50 (&mgr;m) or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>A, the first plate H<highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> has protrusion H<highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>A at opposite ends thereof, respectively.

In addition, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the main part with a print element substrate omitted, as seen from above in the ejection direction. This main part corresponds to the print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and the first plate H<highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> described above for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>A show a part of the print head which ejects one type of ink. In the following description, reference numerals different from those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> will be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> A print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>) has a substrate body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A consists of a silicon and electro-thermal conversion elements <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a ejection energy generator are formed on the substrate body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A correspondingly to ejection openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively. The substrate body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A is further formed with electrode wiring thereon for supplying power to the electro-thermal conversion elements and also is formed thereon with an orifice plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in which the ejection openings are formed and a partition wall <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for partitioning the ejection openings <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the liquid paths <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the above description for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and other figures, the substrate body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A and the orifice plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the partition wall <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed on the substrate body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A are explained as an integral component, that is, the print element substrate H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>) is bonded and fixed to a support member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (the first plate H<highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>) which is formed thereon with an ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (the ink supply opening H<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>) communicating with an ink supply opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (H<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>). In the above configuration, the ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> constitute an ink supply chamber for a plurality of ejection openings. The ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>A corresponds to the ink supply opening H<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> described above for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> but is shaped like a slot, different from the circular ink supply opening shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The circular ink supply path is used in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> and other figures as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on a silicon wafer constituting the substrate body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A is provided with a heating resistor layer constituting the electro-thermal conversion element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, electrode wiring for supplying power to the electro-thermal conversion element, and the like, as patterns formed by means of the photolithography technique. In addition, the orifice plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the partition wall <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed of a photosensitive resin. Furthermore, the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed therein by applying anisotropic etching to the silicon wafer and has its external shape formed by means of cutting. The print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected by means of the TAB (Tape Automated Bonding) connecting technique to the electric wiring board H<highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> described above for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and other figures, in order to apply to each electro-thermal conversion element a voltage pulse depending on a printing signal. The print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fixedly bonded to the support member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through accurate positioning, and an adhesive used for this binding is desirably very viscous so as not to flow to the ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, in the above configuration of the print head, recesses for air chambers are formed in portions of the support member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is bonded to the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, pressure waves propagating from each liquid path upon ink ejection are absorbed by these air chambers to solve the above described problem with respect to the refill of ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are each formed in a fashion corresponding to a predetermined number of ink ejection openings, and in addition to the recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, connection grooves <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are each formed in a bonding and fixing surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the support member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a fashion corresponding to one of the recesses. Thus, when the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the support member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during a print head manufacturing process, a back surface of the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the recesses and grooves formed in the bonding and fixing surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the support member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> form air chambers (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and communication paths (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> According to such a configuration of the air chambers, a pressure caused when the ink is ejected from the ejection opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, but propagates, as a change in air pressure, to the air chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>mainly via the communication path <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that corresponds to the ejection openings. This variation in pressure having a relatively high pressure value has its value reduced in the air chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which has a larger volume than the communication path <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. That is, the variation in ink pressure caused upon ink ejection can be absorbed by the air chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to reduce adverse effects on the subsequent refill. Thereby, the ejection period need not be determined taking the refill time into consideration as described above. As a result, enabling the print head to be driven at a relatively high speed. In addition, since the air chambers are structured to be closed with respect to the atmosphere, the above described various problems such as the increase in ink viscosity as occurring in the conventional pressure-absorbing structure can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Although, in the above description, the air chamber is provided in a fashion corresponding to the predetermined number of ink ejection openings and mainly absorb the variation in pressure caused by ejection from the corresponding ejection openings, of course the present invention is not limited to this configuration but is applicable to other structures. Each air chamber may be formed in a fashion corresponding to each one of the ejection openings and may be configured to effect such a pressure-absorbing action as to absorb ejection pressures from ejection openings that do not correspond to the disposed position of this air chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> In other words, in the structure of the air chamber in this embodiment, the air chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>requires a sufficient volume to absorb the pressure upon ejection without entry of the ink, and the communication path <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>requires a sufficient volume (flow resistance) or capillary force to prevent the ink from being guided into the air chamber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while guiding a sufficient amount of pressure into the air chamber upon ejection. Thus, in this embodiment, when driving the print head with the ejection amount 15P1 and with 256 ejection openings at a frequency 10 kHz, the air chamber is structured so that A&equals;1.5 mm, B&equals;0.4 mm, C&equals;0.4 mm, D&equals;0.4 mm, E&equals;0.2 mm, and F&equals;0.8 mm, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference>, thereby sufficiently providing the above described effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, similar effects can be obtained by forming similar air chambers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and communication paths <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the rear surface of the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, instead of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C. In this case, the grooves for the air chambers can be formed in the print element substrate by means of anisotropic etching or the like. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, illustration of the orifice plates, the partition walls, and other components is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above described effects, the configuration of the air chamber according to this embodiment enables the air chambers and other components can be formed by forming the recesses for the air chambers in either the support member or the print element substrate and then joining the member to the other member, thereby enabling the air chambers and other components to be formed easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> water-repellent agent may be applied to each wall of the groove <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) forming the air chamber, to form a water-repellent layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This configuration, in combination with the effect of the shape of the communication path <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), can further appropriately prevent the ink from entering the air chamber. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the present invention is applied to a print head including as a support member two support members, a first support member and a second support member. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</cross-reference> are sectional views showing a main part of a print head according to this embodiment as seen from an ejection direction and from a side relative to the ejection direction, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> As shown in these figures, the print head according to this embodiment includes as the support member a first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that fixedly supports the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and has an ink supply path, and a second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that fixedly supports the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and is provided with the ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for supplying the ink to the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a member that directly connected to the substrate body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A constituting the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is of a material such as silicon, alumina, aluminum nitride, or silicon carbide due to their thermal conductivity, ink resistance, strength, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the first embodiment, the recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and grooves <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the air chambers and communication paths, respectively, are formed in a portion of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which is bonded to the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, the air chambers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and other components are formed when the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> A modification of this embodiment which has the recesses and other components formed in the first support member is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A, 16B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C. The structure shown in these figures has a pair of air chambers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as a unit which is formed correspondingly to each of six kinds of inks. More specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference> shows a support member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as seen from the above it, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference> shows section with respect to a line A-A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</cross-reference> shows a connected state of a print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the support member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a section. A structure shown in these figures differs from a structure that two or more air chambers are provided along an array of electro-thermal conversion elements for a head structure of each kind of ink, but has only two air chambers for each kind of ink. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A, respective one recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and respective one groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at both ends of the array of electro-thermal conversion elements are formed for each kind of ink. More over, apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>A and the A-A section shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B, a</cross-reference> shape of the ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> differs from that described for the above embodiments but is such that a opening area of the path is made broader at nearer to a connection portion to the print element substrate. This broaden shape allows the ink supply path to cover respective ink paths and to supply the respective kinds of inks to them which correspond to a plurality of electro-thermal conversion elements arranged in the head structure for the respective kinds of inks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> To the support member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> described above the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected so that the air chamber (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and communicating path (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is formed in a sealed condition against the atmosphere and the pressure waves caused upon ink ejection in the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are absorbed by the air chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The head structure of this embodiment in which the respective air chambers are provided at the respective ends of the array of electro-thermal conversion elements allows pitches between head structures for respective kinds of inks, which are arranged in a line, to be small. This on the other hand allows the print head to be small. More over, the air chamber of this embodiment is positioned at farthest point from the ink supply path. The farthest position is a position where the pressure waves are relatively difficult to be absorbed, and thus providing the air chamber at this position enables the air chamber to function its effect at maximum, as described later referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A, 17B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>C are views showing other structures. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference> relates to a structure wherein the recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the connection grooves <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed on the back side of the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as in the first embodiment. Additionally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17B and 17C</cross-reference> relate to structures in which the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> form the air chambers and other components: in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>B, the recesses and the grooves are formed in the first support member, while, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>C, the recesses and the grooves are formed in the second support member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> These structures of the air chambers and other components can provide effects similar to those described in the first embodiment. In addition, each wall of the air chamber may be subjected to a water-repellency-applying process to further prevent the ink from entering the air chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> As described above, various forms are possible for the positions at which the air chambers or other components are formed, but a plurality of air chambers or other components disposed at different positions may be combined together to provide larger effects on refill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> (Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> This embodiment relates to a configuration having recesses formed in part of a surface of the first support member which is connected to the substrate body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A to form a liquid chamber with the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby absorbing pressures originating from ink ejection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> That is, in this embodiment, the ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> formed in the support member is not shaped like a slot as in the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the print element substrate but like a cylinder formed in a fashion corresponding to a substantially central portion of the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference>. Thus, the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is in the form of an elongated liquid chamber extending along the arrangement of the ejection openings. The ink is supplied to this liquid chamber via the ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is in communication with the liquid chamber at its central portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, a surface of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which is connected to the substrate body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A of the print element substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in which the ink supply opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shaped like the liquid chamber is formed has a plurality of recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> formed therein along the arrangement of the ejection openings (not shown). Of course, the recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are shaped to prevent entry of the ink from the ink supply path <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as in the first and second embodiments. In this case, the recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are desirably as deep as possible. That is, the recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> hold the ink when the capillary force and the like have been appropriately set as in the above described embodiments, and air is constrained deep inside the recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> by means of the held ink, thereby constituting the air chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> When the recesses <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> cannot be made sufficiently deep, a through-hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed in the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed in the second support member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to communicate with the through-hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. This configuration serves to form air chambers having a sufficient volume. Air chambers that are more effective on refill can be formed by varying the shape of the recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> The above described print head according to each embodiment uses thermal energy generated by the electro-thermal conversion elements to induce film boiling in the liquid (ink) to form bubbles so that the pressure of the bubbles causes the ink to be ejected, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Here, superior effect obtained by the preferred embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C, among the embodiments of the air chamber described above, will be explained below. The effect is specifically directed to that an effect of a low frequency vibration of the ink upon the ink supply can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing a ink supply path obtained by connecting the printing head shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C with the ink tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> (General Configuration of the Ink Supply Path) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> To a head chip including the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, the partition walls, printing element substrate provided with the orifice plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the like, the ink passing through the ink tank H<highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> as a ink supply source, a filter <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and an ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, sequentially, is supplied. The ink supply path <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed by connecting a first ink supply part <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a second ink supply part <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a third ink supply part <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, a fourth ink supply part <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a fifth ink supply part <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, sequentially. Among the ink supply parts, the first and the third ink supply parts <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are elongated in a direction from the ink tank to a head portion, respectively. On the other hand, the second ink supply part is elongated in a direction which crosses the direction of the first and the third ink supply parts <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. As a result of this, the first, the second and the third ink supply parts form a bending ink supply path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> (A Configuration of a Neighborhood of the Air Chamber) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> The fourth ink supply part <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is disposed successively to the fist, the second and the third ink supply parts. The fourth ink supply part <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a shape (inclined portions or taper potions <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>) that a cross section area of the fourth ink supply part gradually increases from a third ink supply part side to a head chip side. Furthermore, successively to the fourth ink supply part, the fifth ink supply part <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is disposed. The fifth ink supply part <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is what has a constant cross section area. A member forming the fifth ink supply part <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has a contact surface with the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A of the head chip. At corresponding portions within the contact surface to both ends of an arrangement of the electro-thermal converting elements on the print element substrate, the recess <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the air chamber and the groove <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the communicating path are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A forming the head chip is disposed successively to the fifth ink supply part <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. A through hole space (ink supply port) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is formed in the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, has a tapered shape in which a cross section area of the through hole space decreases from a fifth ink supply part side to ink flow paths formed on the substrate. As a result, a first taper portion of the fourth ink supply part <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a second taper portion of the through hole space <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are arranged and the air chamber <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is disposed at an area at which respective inclined planes of the first and the second taper portions crosses each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> (An Alleviation Effect Upon a Backward Stream of the Ink) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the air chamber and the ink supply path according to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference> is effective in reducing an effect of the low frequency vibration of ink especially in the bubble through jet method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>H are views showing serial ejection states according to the bubble through jet method. As show in these figures, a bubble <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> generated by means of the electro-thermal converting element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> communicates with an atmospheric air (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24F</cross-reference>) before an ink droplet is separated to fly from the head (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24H</cross-reference>), and therefor disappearing process of the bubble <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> does not exist. As a result, during generation and growth of the bubble, an interface between gas and liquid <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed at a back part of the bubble <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> moves back. Then, the backward movement of the interface causes the ink disposed backward is pressed to be moved to an ink supply path side. Especially when an ejection duty is high, the moved back ink, by a total amount thereof, makes a great effect upon a behavior of ink movement in the ink supply path. The applicant calls a vibration of the ink all over the ink supply path &ldquo;low frequency vibration&rdquo;, in contrast to relatively high frequency vibration of the refill at ejection operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the effect of the moved back ink upon the ink supply can be alleviated by means of both the second taper portion of the through hole space <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed in the head chip (the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A) and the first taper portion of the fourth ink supply part <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. More specifically, an action of the ink caused by an expanded path of the second taper portion and an action of the ink caused by deflection of a backward ink stream by the first taper portion allow the effect of a reflecting of the moved back ink upon successive ejection to be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> (An Effect of the Air Chamber) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the first and second taper portions allows the effect of the vibration in a direction (longitudinal direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference>) along which the ink moves reciprocally to be alleviated, described above. However, a vibration of the ink in a direction (lateral direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference>) which crosses a direction of the ink supply is derived from the taper portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The air chamber of the embodiment functions as alleviating the effect of the lateral ink movement (vibration). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of embodiment for the air chamber and the communicating path between the air chamber and the ink supply path is such that the air chamber and the communicating path are provided at a position along a direction crossing the ink supply direction, i.e. the lateral direction (an arrangement direction of the plurality of the liquid paths), and at a position which is faced by both the first and second taper portions. This arrangement allows the lateral vibration of the ink to be directly alleviated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> It is more preferable that pair of the air chambers are provided at opposite positions to each other because respective alleviation effects by air chambers are shown without interference with each other. Moreover, the air chamber forms a sealed space with a member for the head chip or the ink supply unit or members for both the head chip and the ink supply unit, except for a portion being contact with the ink to form the interface between gas and liquid. Then, it is guaranteed that an air received in the air unit effectively functions as a damper. The air chamber functioning as the damper may be interpreted as a storage member storing a part of the ink temporarily, from a different view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> When a meniscus of the ink is formed in the communicating path communicating the air chamber with the ink supply path, a responsibility in that the air chamber functions as the damper to alleviate the lateral vibration of the ink can be improved. In order to form the meniscus in the communicating path for improving the responsibility, a cross section area of the communicating path is determined within a predetermined range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> In the case of disposing the air chamber at a side area of ink supply path whose cross section area is small, the alleviation effect by the air chamber can not show because the ink stream (vibration) in the lateral direction is almost not caused. In addition, since an ink flow speed at a portion having small cross section area in the ink supply path is large, the alleviation effect can not show sufficiently. In contrast, in the case of disposing the air chamber at a side area of the ink supply path whose cross section area is large, the sufficient alleviation effect can be shown by the air chamber even if the air chamber has relatively small size. Moreover, a cross section area of the communicating path communicating the air chamber with the ink supply path is determined to be larger than the cross section area of the ink flow path so that the air chamber functions as the damper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> The cross section area of portions of the printing head according to the embodiment are shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> The cross section area S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the air chamber <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>B, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>C): 0.765 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the cross section area S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the communicating path (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>B, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>C): 0.08 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the cross section area S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the third ink supply part <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>A): 0.64 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the cross section area S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the ink flow path <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>D, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>A): 0.000416 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the cross section areas F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of gates of the ink flow path (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>E): 0.000143 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> (An Effect of the Ink Supply Path Upon Ink Supply) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Also in the bubble through jet method, the bubble is generated and grows n the ink so that the ink is ejected. However, the meniscus formed with the interface between gas and liquid of the bubble is positioned behind the electro-thermal converting element when the above ejection is performed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24H</cross-reference>. This moved back meniscus can be returned to a position where the ink ejection is able to be executed only by the capillary force. The capillary force caused in each of the ink low paths, as a whole, results in the ink in the ink supply path moving. For this ink movement, the ink supply path of the embodiment has a configuration that the cross section area of the ink supply path gradually increases from an upper stream of the ink supply path to lower stream of the same. This configuration allow the ink supply from the upper stream to be smoothly performed and prevent a lack of ink supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> Further, the air chamber is disposed adjacent to the fifth ink supply part and then ink contemporary stored in the air chamber can be supplied to the head chip upon ink ejection so that the air chamber functions as a part of ink supply source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> (An Effect of the Air Chamber Showing in Relation to a Position of the Head Unit) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> The printing head of the embodiment is used in a manner that ink is ejected downwards. In the ejection downward, the gravity acts upon the ejection as shown by an arrow G in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference>. For this case, the ink supply unit is disposed above the head chip and the air chamber is disposed at an ink supply unit side with respect to connection portion between the ink supply unit and the head chip. Further, the air chamber has a shape that the chamber is elongated upward so that a volume efficiency of the air chamber is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> (An Effect of an Additional Configuration) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> An arrangement that a plurality of dummy ejection openings is provide at both ends of low of the ejection openings is known. The dummy openings allow an effect of a back wave (cross talk) to be reduced. Therefor, when both the air chamber and the dummy openings are provided, the alleviation effect upon the vibration of ink may be further improved. Further, the ink supply path having bending path of the embodiment functions as directly alleviating the backward movement of ink from the head chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Configurations of the head and the air chamber shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C (FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>E) is preferable to especially reduce the effect of the low frequency vibration of the ink upon the ink ejection so that good ejection state is realized, even if the head has a compact structure. Configurations of other embodiments except the configuration shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>C rather reduces a high frequency vibration of ink effectively, but must have relatively many air chamber to become large sized one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the above description, according to the embodiments of the present invention, the air chambers, which communicates with the ink supply chamber common to the plurality of ink ejection openings for supplying the ink to these ink ejection openings and to which the pressure is transmitted from the ink supply chamber, is provided. Accordingly, the pressure caused upon ejection of the ink in each ejection opening and propagated to the ink supply chamber also propagates to the air chamber as a change in the pressure of the air in the air chamber and is absorbed due to a compression of an air in the air chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the air chambers are provided at the opposite side of the ejection openings with respect to the print element substrate, the air chamber does not communicate with the atmosphere, thereby preventing the ink in the print head from being made more viscous through the air chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> As a result, the disadvantages relating to ink refill specific to an increase in the number of ink ejection openings of the ink jet print head can be eliminated to provide a particularly excellent fast-response capability and ejection performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described in detail with respect to preferred embodiments, and it will now be apparent from the foregoing to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspect, and it is the intention, therefore, in the apparent claims to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
