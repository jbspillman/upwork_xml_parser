<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to medical devices and methods of detection and treatment of cancer, and more particularly to minimally invasive medical systems including a radiation detecting probe for locating radioactively tagged tissue, e.g., a &ldquo;sentinel&rdquo; lymph node, within the body of the patient and for retrieving or removing that tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The use of radioactive materials to tag tissue within a patient for effecting its localization and demarcation by radiation detecting devices has been disclosed in the medical literature for at least forty years. Significant developments in the localization and demarcation of tissue bearing radioactive isotope tags for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes have occurred since that time. In fact, it is now becoming an established modality in the diagnosis and/or treatment of certain diseases, e.g., cancer, to introduce monoclonal antibodies or other tumor or lymph node localizing agents tagged with a radioactive isotope (e.g., Technetium 99m, Indium 111, Iodine 123, and Iodine 125) into the body of the patient. Such radio pharmaceuticals tend to localize in particular tissue, such as the cancerous tissue, so that the gamma radiation emitted by the isotope agent can be detected by a radiation detector, e.g., a probe. In particular, the radiation detector or probe is disposed or positioned adjacent portion of the patient&apos;s body where the cancerous tissue is suspected to be in order to detect if any radiation is emanating from that site. If it is this indicates that cancerous tissue is likely to be found at that site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Prior art, hand-held, radiation detecting probes particularly suitable for such cancer-finding applications are commercially available from the assignee of this invention, CareWise Medical Products, Inc., under the trademark C-TRAK. In U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,959,547 and 5,036,201 assigned to the same assignee as this invention there are disclosed hand-held radiation detecting probes having collimating means to establish the field of view or &ldquo;solid angle of acceptance&rdquo; of the probe. In U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,119,818 and 5,170,055, also assigned to the same assignee as this invention, there are disclosed hand-held radiation detecting probes and accessories optimized to biopsy radio-labeled tissues. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,803 (Donnan et al.) there is also disclosed a hand-held radiation detecting probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer a radiopharmaceutical can injected adjacent a detected tumor site, e.g., within the breast, to migrate to the closest draining lymph node (the &ldquo;sentinel&rdquo; node) so that localization of that node and its examination can be readily effected in order to evaluate the extent, if any, of metastasis of the cancer. Heretofore, no minimally invasive instrument, e.g., radioactivity detection probe, has existed to not only detect or localize the radioactively tagged tissue, e.g., the sentinel node, but also to safely dislodge it from adjacent tissue and to ensnare or trap it so that it can be removed for analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is a general object of this invention to provide a minimally invasive surgical instrument and method of use which addresses that need and which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the subject invention are achieved by providing a probe for minimally invasive introduction within the body of a living being. The probe is arranged to detect radiation emanating from radioactively tagged tissue, e.g., a sentinel lymph node, within the being&apos;s body to determine the location of that tissue. The probe is arranged to be readily manipulated and moved adjacent to the radioactively tagged tissue, and includes means (e.g., plural extendable members) for engaging (e.g., piercing or otherwise ensnaring) the radioactively tagged tissue to remove it from the being&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of this invention the probe also preferably comprises a blunt tissue dissector. The tissue dissector is arranged to bluntly separate the radioactively tagged tissue from adjacent tissue so that the radioactively tagged tissue may be readily removed from the being&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention an attachment, e.g., a disposable sheath, for a radioactivity detecting probe is provided. The probe is a small device for minimally invasive introduction within the body of a living being to detect radiation emanating from radioactively tagged tissue, e.g., a sentinel lymph node, within the being&apos;s body to thereby determine the location of that tissue. The probe is arranged to be readily manipulated and moved adjacent to the radioactively tagged tissue. The attachment is arranged to be initially mounted on the probe prior to use and basically comprises means (e.g., plural extendable members) for engaging (e.g., piercing or otherwise ensnaring) the radioactively tagged tissue to remove it from the being&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of this invention the attachment, e.g., sheath, also preferably comprises a blunt tissue dissecting device. The tissue dissecting device is arranged to bluntly separate the radioactively tagged tissue from adjacent tissue so that the radioactively tagged tissue may be readily removed from the being&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another preferred aspect of this invention, the instrument may be fully integrated and self-powered, or may be partially integrated and self-powered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In any case the instrument, probe and/or attachment for a probe may include means for illuminating the situs of the radioactively tagged tissue and may also include means for visualizing that situs.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawing where like reference numerals refer to like parts there is shown at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 a</cross-reference> system incorporating a probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with this invention. The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed an arranged in accordance with the teachings of copending U.S. patent application, Ser. No. 08/430,589, filed on Apr. 25, 1995, entitled Apparatus and Methods For Determining Spatial Coordinates of Radiolabelled Tissue Using Gamma Rays And Associated Characteristic X-Rays, now U.S. Pat. No.: 5,694,933, which is assigned to the same assignee as this invention and whose disclosure is incorporated by reference herein. The system is arranged to be used with any suitable radiopharmaceutical which is injected or otherwise introduced into the body of the being to be treated for specific uptake by the suspected cancer tissue or sentinel lymph node so that the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the system can determine the location of that cancer or lymph node and remove it with minimal invasion to the patient&apos;s body. To that end the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> basically comprises a minimal access surgical probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an associated analyzer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The probe assembly is coupled to the analyzer by a cable <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for detecting radiation emanating from the hidden source in a patient, e.g., a sentinel lymph node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) tagged with the radiopharmaceutical, to localize that node, whereupon securement means (to be described later) in the probe can be operated to engage or otherwise ensnare the node so that it can be removed by the probe from the being&apos;s body for analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed so that it is an integrated instrument, e.g., the radiation detector and associated components and the securement means for ensnaring the node forming a single unit. Alternatively, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may comprise a conventional radiation detecting probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A, like that described earlier, and a separate sheath or sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for accommodating the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A. To that end the sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a central passageway <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extending through it into which the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A can be located. The sidewall of the sheath includes the heretofore mentioned tissue securement means. The sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed so that it is disposable, whereas the radiation detecting probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A is reusable. A detachable, side shield <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in the form of a sleeve of radiation blocking material, may be located on the distal end of the probe assembly for use in high background radiation applications, e.g., when the sentinel node is close to the injection site). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In either case the probe assembly of this invention accomplishes its task by minimal invasive percutaneous penetration into the patient&apos;s body at the suspected situs of the lymph node, while the analyzer monitors the radiation picked up by the probe. By monitoring the radiation detected from the radiopharmaceutically-tagged tissue (e.g., gamma radiation, X radiation and/or annihilation radiation) and which is within the probe&apos;s solid angle of acceptance <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the analyzer provides signals to the user to guide him/her so that the probe can be moved (by grasping its proximal end or handle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) from the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> wherein its distal end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is located immediately adjacent the lymph node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At this point the tissue securement means (to be described hereafter) can be operated to ensnare the lymph node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown herein the securement means comprise three extendable, elongated piercing members or wires <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Each member is located within a longitudinally extending passageway <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the wall of the sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are arranged to be normally held in a retracted position within the sheath, so that their distal ends <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are covered as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. This enables the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, i.e., the sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A therein, to be readily inserted either percutaneously or through a surgical incision to an internal situs, e.g., interstitial tissue, in which the distal end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the probe assembly is located adjacent the radioactively tagged tissue <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, without interference caused by the extending members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The probe can be moved or manipulated while the operator monitors the output of the analyzer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in order to locate the distal end of the assembly immediately adjacent the tagged tissue. At this time the extending members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be operated by means (not shown) to cause their distal ends <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to extend out, e.g., 5-10 mm, of their respective passageways <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred aspect of this invention the extendable members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are arranged so that, when extended, their distal ends <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extend inward at an acute angle, e.g., 30-60 degrees, to the central longitudinal axis of the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and intersect each other as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. This action causes the members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to pierce into the tagged tissue, if the tagged tissue is sufficiently large (e.g., 3-4 mm or greater in diameter) and thereby &ldquo;lock&rdquo; it in place. If the tagged tissue is smaller, the intersecting extendable members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> will not pierce the tissue but will otherwise surround or &ldquo;entrap&rdquo; it, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In any case, the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can then be retracted or withdrawn from the being&apos;s body, carrying the tagged tissue <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of this invention the sheath may include means to direct the distal ends <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the extending members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at an acute angle inward, or those members may be formed so that they automatically assume that orientation when they are extended out of their respective passageways <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Moreover, means (not shown) may be provided to adjust the angle at which the members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extend outward from the sheath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> If additional means are deemed necessary to ensure that the tagged tissue <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is either trapped between the extending members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the distal end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), or is pierced and ensnared (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>) so that it does not fall off of the probe assembly during the retrieval process, additional holding means (not shown) may be provided. That means may consist of a &ldquo;purse string&rdquo; coupled to the extending members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to secure them together and to the ensnared tissue. Moreover, the extending members may include means, e.g., barbs, to ensure that the tissue once grabbed or pierced does not fall off. Such barbs may be annular or longitudinal or combinations of both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The passageways <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the sheath can be used to provide various other functions for the probe assembly. For example suction, from means (not shown), can be used by the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to aid in holding the tagged tissue <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in place on the distal end <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The suction means can also be used to remove blood or other fluid from the operative situs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Energy application means, e.g., a unipolar or bipolar diathermy unit, may be provided to extend out of the sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, one of the wires <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be a unipolar diathermy wire to be extended into the tagged tissue, if desired. If bipolar diathermy is desired, two of the wires <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be used to provide it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Any of the passageways <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be used to deliver any desired material, including biologically active materials, for any desired purpose. For example, any passageway <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be used to deliver some flowable material to the situs of the tagged tissue to prevent the migration of cells, e.g, cancer cells, therefrom or to kill such cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In order to expedite the tissue localization process the probe assembly may include collimation means, e.g., a snap-on collimator (not shown), an adjustable collimator, (not shown) etc., to establish or adjust the solid angle of acceptance <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of radioactivity by the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> While the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used without an analyzer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the teachings of our aforementioned copending patent application Ser. No. 08/430,589, it is preferable to use such an analyzer. In this regard the analyzer can measure the characteristic x-ray photons and full energy gamma ray photons received by the probe&apos;s sensor to determine if the ratio of the characteristic x-ray photons to the full energy gamma ray photons is appropriate for the particular radiopharmaceutical used to tag the tissue, i.e., corresponds to the natural abundance of the characteristic x-rays and full energy gamma rays for that radiopharmaceutical. If the ratio is appropriate that fact enables the operator to accurately determine the near field location of the radioactively tagged tumor since there could not be any far field source of radiation which could interfere with the precise location of the tumor (a source of far field radiation would result in an improper ratio of characteristic x-rays to full energy gamma rays). Conversely, an inappropriate ratio, e.g., a reading of significantly more full energy gamma-ray photons than characteristic x-ray photons, will indicate that the source of radiation is far field. Thus, the probe should be moved to a new position, until an appropriate ratio of characteristic x-ray photons to full energy gamma ray photons is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the &ldquo;sentinel node&rdquo; procedure, which is the accepted modality of treatment for melanoma, and which will likely be the accepted modality of treatment for breast cancer can be effected percutaneously using the subject invention, instead of through conventional cut-down or open surgery, e.g., lumpectomy, as is the case at present. Moreover, the subject invention has particular utility for prostate cancer treatment, wherein the prostate containing the primary tumor is injected with a radiocolloid and any draining lymph nodes exhibiting radioactivity (sentinel lymph nodes) can be removed with minimum invasion to the patient. Similarly, lymph nodes identified by radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies and peptides can be detected and excised with minimum trauma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of this invention enables one to pierce and snare or to surround, apply suction to, suture or staple selected tagged tissue (e.g., a sentinel lymph node) and thus attach the tagged tissue to the probe tip in order to allow withdrawal of it as the probe is withdrawn. In the embodiment disclosed above the extending members or wires <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be spring steel which are preformed to converge from a straight channel, alternatively they may be straight wires directed by angle channels, or other means in the sheath, or any combination thereof. The extending members may be tubular sections instead of solid wires (for reasons to be discussed later). In any case, the extending members can be adjusted during the operation to vary their angle of attack relative to the energy detecting probe&apos;s nose (distal end). A simple adjustment mechanism, such as a purse string attached to the tips of the extending elements can act against the intrinsic springiness or bias of the material making up those elements or can act against the applied force of the portion of the sheath causing the tips to be angled, in order to adjust the angle of attack. The angle can be adjusted from 30 to 60 degrees, in order to pierce and/or entrap and/or apply suction to the smallest lymph nodes. Additionally, at a given angle of attack, the tips of the three extending members can be advanced relative to the probe&apos;s tip to better accommodate very large lymph nodes or other tissue chunks. Moreover, at a given angle of attack, the tips of the three extending members can be retracted relative to the probe&apos;s tip to better accommodate very small lymph nodes, or other tissue chunks. Additionally, the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A could be retracted relative to the sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and hence the tips of the extending members or wires <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, to provide clearance for repositioning the angle of attack and so that they meet closer to the horizontal. As mentioned above, the extending members or wires can include barbs, like &ldquo;fish hook barbs&rdquo; and can be from about 0.1 to 3 mm long, designed to spread in response to tissue movement away from the probe&apos;s tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> While the probe is shown with three extending members which are simultaneously advanced into or around the tissue in front of the probe tip the probe can make use of more or less members, as the case may be. In any case the probe can be used under external ultrasound guidance to accurately pierce, snare or surround, apply suction to the selected tagged tissue, while avoiding damage to adjacent blood vessels, nerves, peritoneum, pleura, and other important normal biological structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As mentioned earlier, it is also contemplated that the extending members, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, instead of being solid wires, can be hollow hypodermic tubing, capable of injecting appropriate substances into the lymph nodes or other tagged tissues to kill tumor cells, or to prevent the spread or seeding of tumor cells, or to initiate and propagate localized blood clotting, or for instilling other local/regional pharmacological agents. Moreover, extending members in the form of hollow tubes enable the application of suction therethrough as an additional attachment mechanism to the lymph node or other tagged tissue. Further still, the suction can be used to remove blood and/or excess fluids. As noted earlier, the channels or passageways <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in which the extendable wires <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are located, can themselves serve as the channels for powerful suction attachment of the lymph node and other tissues. Moreover, these channels or passageways are suitable for injecting any appropriate substance into or around the lymph node or other tissues to kill tumor cells, or to prevent the spread or seeding of tumor cells, or to initiate and propagate localized blood clotting, or for instilling other local/regional pharmacological therapy, or for irrigation and suction of blood and or excess instilled fluids. Moreover, the passageways in which the extending solid wires are located, or the alternative embodiment of tubular wires, or both, can serve as means for installation of fluid solutions for other associated diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When the tagged node is ensnared by the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> it can be teased out of surrounding tissue by gentle pressure, under external ultrasound visualization, if desired. Thus, the minimally invasive radiation sensing tissue snaring probe of the invention is particularly suited to locate and retrieve sentinel nodes associated with any solid tumor, such as prostate, breast, lung, colon, rectal, and others. Scarring and trauma is thus minimized. Moreover, trauma-related-release of local growth factors, including platelet derived growth factors, which can lead to tumor reoccurrence, is also minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The probe can be constructed so that it is any desired size. For example, it may be 5 to 16 mm in outside diameter, with a total length of about 9-18 inches (228.6 mm-457.2 mm). Specifically, it may be of an outside diameter of 9.5 mm for easy percutaneous introduction into the suspected site via a conventional 10 mm trocar. The distal end or nose of the probe may be configured to accept a snap on collimator, which may have approximately one millimeter channels bored into the walls, or cast as longitudinal channels or grooves on or within the inner wall of the snap on-collimator. The snap-on collimator may be made of Bismuth alloys or other low-toxicity, low-melting point, easily cast metals, or non-toxic radiation shielding composites, such as Barium filled epoxies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> An additional embodiment may consist of a 5 to 10 mm outside diameter straight probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A. An 8 mm version may be ensheathed in a closely fitting disposable plastic, sterile sheath 8.2 mm in inside diameter and 10 mm in outside diameter and including the tissue attachment means, i.e. the extending wires <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The optional outer sheathing cylinder <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) may be of 10.2 mm inside diameter and 12 mm outside diameter so it can be used to serve as an additional side shielding for the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during the process of localizing or finding the tagged tissue or node. Alternatively, the sheathing cylinder <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be mounted on the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A itself. Moreover, the sheath <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be slidable on whatever component it is mounted. The outer sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, i.e., the portion which houses the extending wires <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, can be made only about 25 mm long and may be constructed of any ionizing radiation shielding material. In use, that sheath may simply be slid back along the longitudinal axis of the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A as the probe penetrates the skin and subcutaneous tissues. That sheath may also simply be slipped off the front of the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A after percutaneous localization of the radioactive node or other tissue, prior to skin penetration. The outer sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> should allow the probe to detect signal from the node as low as 2.5 counts per second, despite noise from the nearby injection site, which may be emitting as much as 37,000 counts per second. Positioning of the leading or distal edge <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the outer sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be flush with the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A tip or forward of the probe tip, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The radiation shielding necessary to initially find the node adjacent to a very high background count is substantially greater than the shielding required to track the dissection of that localized node. The sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or the optional outer sheath <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be about 10 half value layers thick (1.9 mm for Tungsten 95% alloy at 140 keV) and the intrinsic probe walls shielding may be about 7 half value layers thick (1.33 mm for Tungsten 95% alloy at 140 keV). Thus, the reusable probe sheath may be as little as 5 millimeters in diameter (2.66 mm thick with a wall, 2.0 mm diameter radiation detector) while still having 99% exclusion of side incident protons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The detector may be a rod of Cesium Iodide or of Gadolinium Orthosilicate, either of which is only doped with a scintillation activator at one end to produce an active region approximately 3 mm long, in a rod that may be 100 mm long. In this arrangement, there is no light loss between the scintillation detector portion of the rod and the light pipe, as there were would if there were separate joined pieces of scintillator and light pipe. The sides and one end of the rod may be coated with reflective material, such as a thin-layer-deposition of gold, silver, platinum, etc., or a thin-layer-deposition of Teflon reflective material. Thus, a highly efficient, very small diameter intrastitial or endoscopic probe may be constructed, wherein the light pipe material provides backshielding against injection site radioactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The diathermy capability of the probe assembly as described earlier provides the option of cutting attached tissues or of coagulating bleeding vessels. For unipolar or monopolar diathermy coagulation, only one of the extending wires is advanced from the probe tip and the probe is rotated. For bipolar diathermy, two wires are partially advanced, leaving a tissue gap between them. Monopolar diathermy can be accomplished with one or more wires, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A sterile disposable accessory (not shown) ensheathing the probe can be combined with a sterile disposable probe power cord, or can be combined with a sterile disposable power cord sheath. Alternatively, a self contained probe can be placed inside a &ldquo;Ziploc&rdquo; sterile disposable accessory container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It is also contemplated that the probe itself can be self-contained, that is the probe includes any of the circuitry found in the entire system described heretofore, e.g., the radiation signal analyzing circuitry, and a self-contained power source, e.g., one or more batteries, for effecting tagged tissue localization and retrieval. Thus, the self-contained probe may include means operative in response to the signal analyzing circuitry for providing audible and/or visual signals of the type provided by the computer or any other signals suitable for perception by the personnel utilizing the probe. In the interest of compactness and simplicity, the self-contained probe may not include the means for producing the visual and/or audible signals, but may rather include some wireless transmission means, e.g., a radio frequency transmitter, an IR transmitter, a laser or other light transmitter, etc., for wirelessly transmitting signals from the probe to some receiver located outside the body of the patient, whereupon the visual and/or audible signals may be produced for perception by the operating personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> there is shown a probe incorporating a single-hole collimator which can be used as part of the probe assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the subject invention. That probe is designated by the reference number <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B and basically comprises a cylindrical sidewall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> formed of a radiation shielding material. A scintillation crystal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is located within the interior of the sidewall a short distance proximally of the distal end of the sidewall, so that the sidewall serves as a single hole collimator establishing the probe&apos;s solid angle of acceptance <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for producing a valid signal. A photomultiplier or a photodiode <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is located distally of the crystal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to receive the light flashes produced by the crystal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from radiation impinging on it within the probe&apos;s solid angle of acceptance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Other collimation can be used to reduce or narrow the solid angle of acceptance of the probe of this invention. In fact, such collimation may be adjustable. To that end in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> there is shown a probe incorporating a dividable single-hole collimator which can be used as part of the probe assembly of the subject invention. That probe is designated by the reference number <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C and is identical in construction to probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B, except that it includes an operable collimation assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (to be described hereinafter). In the interests of brevity the common components of probes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C will be given the same reference numbers and their construction and operation will not be reiterated. The operable collimation assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is arranged to be selectively operated in either a &ldquo;single hole mode,&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, or in a &ldquo;divided hole mode,&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. In the single hole mode the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C provides a field of view or solid angle of acceptance <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> similar to the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B and which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In the divided hole mode, the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C provides a narrower solid angle of acceptance <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. To accomplish that end the collimator assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is made up of plural, e.g., three, hinged pivotable wall members or septa <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Each of the septa is a planar member made up of a radiation resistant material, e.g., lead, or tungsten or platinum-irridium, and which is hingedly connected at <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the inside surface of the cylindrical sleeve <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> immediately distally of the distal end of the scintillation crystal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to create two or more channels <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (in the embodiment shown herein three such channels, to be described hereinafter, are formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C is in the single hole mode the septa <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are pivoted back to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, whereupon virtually the entire interior space within the cylindrical sidewall <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> distally of the crystal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is available to have radiation pass therethrough within the solid angle of acceptance <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In the divided hole mode the septa <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are pivoted to the operative or closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> wherein each free edge (i.e., the edge opposite the edge which is pivotally connected to the cylindrical sidewall) engages the respective free edges of the other septa to effectively divide the interior of the cylinder distally of the crystal into three identically sized pie-shaped sectors or channels <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Each of these channels forms what may be considered its own single hole collimator, so that the combined effect of these three &ldquo;single hole collimators&rdquo; is a combined (divided) collimator, whose combined solid angle of acceptance <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is substantially narrower than when the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C is in the single hole mode as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> there is shown a probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D incorporating radiation back shielding component which can be used as part of the probe assembly of the subject invention. The probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D is similar to probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B described above, except for the inclusion of a backshielding lightpipe <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (to be described hereinafter). In the interest of brevity the common features of probes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D will be given the same reference numbers. The backshielding lightpipe <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is formed of any suitable optically transparent but radiation resistant material, e.g., radiopaque, material. As is known, scintillation crystals typically require a dopant to scintillate in response to ionizing radiation. Undoped Gadolineum Orthosilicate or undoped Bismuth Germinate or undoped Cesium Iodide or even a lead-glass lightpipe can be used to form the backshielding lightpipe <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Thus, with the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D all scintillation events detected by the probe&apos;s crystal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will be those arising from the front (distal end) of the probe. Ideally the backshielding lightpipe <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has the same optical index of refraction as the scintillation crystal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The simplest way to achieve this goal is to use an undoped light pipe that is made of the same material as the scintillation crystal, with an index of refraction matched optical coupling gel or adhesive (not shown). Alternatively, lead-glass can also be fabricated with various indices of refraction specifications to approximate the index of refraction of the scintillation crystal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. An optical coupling compound with an index of refraction half way between the crystal and the lightpipe can be used to maximize optical performance of the two part assembly. An alternative, and more elegant approach, is to create a combined scintillator-lightpipe, starting with an undoped crystal lightpipe, that is without the dopant which allows the scintillation crystal to emit flashes of light. In particular, a rod of undoped scintillation crystal, such as undoped Gadolineum Orthosilicate or undoped Bismuth Germinate, or undoped Cesium Iodide is used, but only one end of the rod is doped with the necessary scintillation dopant to form a scintillation crystal at that end, while the undoped portion forms the lightpipe. As will be appreciated, this arrangement will not have an optical joint between the crystal and lightpipe. The deposition of dopants may be accomplished by any implantation technology appropriate to the crystal depth to be treated. Elimination of the optical joint should allow higher spectral resolution and higher sensitivity within the photopeak due to the elimination of optical interface losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Since lymph nodes are commonly found near blood vessels, damage to blood vessels is a significant potential complication of minimally invasive lymph node surgery. In accordance with one preferred embodiment of this invention the instrument probe or sheath for a probe may include a blunt dissecting device configured to create a dissection space in tissue planes which are adjacent tissue susceptible to damage upon physical removal of an immediately adjacent lymph node. Examples of such injury-susceptible tissue are large veins or a plexus of nerves. Thus, the incorporation of a blunt dissector into the invention can prove quite useful for minimizing trauma during sentinel node dissection. To that end, as will be described in detail later, the probe or the sheath for the probe preferably includes a blunt dissecting device, e.g., an inflatable balloon, for raising the lymph node off the surface of a large vein or a plexus of nerves to minimize possible injury to the vein/nerves during the node&apos;s extraction. The blunt dissecting device, whether a balloon or other suitable blunt dissecting component, can be used to gently separate the adjacent tissue planes to elevate the lymph node off of all nearby vessels or nerves. Moreover, as will also be discussed later, by using a balloon as the blunt dissection device and locating it at the tip of the probe or sheath wherein it is movable with respect thereto, the balloon can serve as additional means for retaining the lymph node onto the probe or sheath. In particular, the pressure applied by an inflated balloon can serve to hold the lymph node between it and the distal end of the probe or sheath to facilitate the removal of the lymph node by the instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, there is shown a disposable sheath <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with this invention for releasable mounting on a probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A (like that described earlier or on any other suitable radiation detecting probe). The sheath is formed of any suitable material, e.g., plastic, and includes a circular sidewall portion <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>A, flat distal end wall portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>B, and a proximal wall portion (not shown). The hollow interior of the sheath is arranged to hold the radiation detecting probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A therein so that radiation within the probe&apos;s solid angle of acceptance <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be received through the distal portion of the sheath. The sheath includes a blunt dissection device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, tagged tissue securement means in the form of plural extendable members <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and visualization means (to be described later). The blunt dissecting device can be of any suitable construction. In the exemplary embodiments shown herein it basically comprises an elongated extendable arm <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> on which an inflatable balloon <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is mounted. The balloon can be formed of any suitable material, either elastic or inelastic. In any case the balloon is arranged to be inflated from a compact condition (not shown) wherein it lies flat against the arm <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and located with a passageway <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> (to be described later) in the sidewall of the sheath <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to an expended condition, like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 15</cross-reference>. The inflation of the balloon is accomplished by introducing a fluid into it through a passageway (not shown) in the arm <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The arm is an elongated linear member which is somewhat flexible to bend slightly in the interest of preventing damage to adjacent tissue when it is extended, yet is sufficiently rigid to hold the inflated balloon at a desired position to accomplish the gentle blunt dissection or separation of the lymph node from adjacent tissue. To that end, the arm has a thickness and resiliency of a conventional shirt collar stay, but is formed of a plastic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the sheath <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also includes plural extendable members <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> which are used to releasably secure the tagged tissue, e.g., sentinel node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to the tip of the sheath so that it can be expeditiously removed from the patient&apos;s body. The details of the plural extendable members <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> will be described later. Suffice it for now to state that each of these members is a finger which is arranged to be extended out of a respective passageway <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>), whereupon its distal end portion assumes a curved configuration to entrap or ensnare the radioactively tagged tissue immediately adjacent the distal end of the sheath. It should be pointed out that the tagged tissue entrapment or ensnarement can be accomplished by one or more of the members piercing that tissue, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, or by the members extending around that tissue without piercing it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The location of the tagged tissue to a position immediately adjacent the distal end of the sheath is accomplished in a similar manner as described above. In particular, the surgeon or other practitioner using the sheath <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A must first locate or find the radioactively tagged tissue, e.g., a sentinel lymph node tagged with a radio-labeled monoclonal antibody or radio-labeled colloid. That is accomplished by use of the probe in the manner as described above or utilizing any other appropriate localizing technique. Once the probe has located the node, e.g., the node is immediately in front of the distal end of the probe, the fingers <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> can be extended in the same manner as described earlier with respect to fingers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to either pierce the node or otherwise ensnare or entrap it. If the node is immediately adjacent some structure which is susceptible to injury by the node entrapment and removal procedure, e.g., if the node is laying right on top of a major vein or at the brachial plexus of nerves, then a different methodology will be utilized to remove that node from that described heretofore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In particular, the alternative methodology entails the blunt dissection or separation of the tagged node from the adjacent tissue by means of the blunt dissecting device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. For example, when the tagged node has been localized so that it is in front of and closely adjacent the tip of the sheath, the arm <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> with the uninflated balloon is then extended out of the passageway <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the balloon inflated. Once the balloon has been deployed (inflated) it can then be used to tease the node off of the adjacent tissue, e.g., the balloon can be inflated distally of the node and then dragged proximally to pull the node toward it as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Thus, by appropriate inflation of the balloon and manipulation of the probe, the node can be gently nudged away from the adjacent tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In some cases, as will be described later, the balloon can be positioned so that the separated node is entrapped between the balloon and the distal end of the probe, whereupon the removal of the probe effects the concomitant removal of the node. It is contemplated, however, that in most situations some degree of additional fixation or securement of the node to the probe will be desirable. To that end the extendable fingers <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the probe are operated, i.e., extended, so that they either pierce the node or surround the node as described earlier. If the blunt dissection is utilized to free the node from adjacent tissue and/or to capture it between the extended balloon and the distal end of the probe, the degree which the fingers will have to be extended from the probe to securely ensnare the node onto the probe may be significantly less than otherwise necessary without the use of the extended balloon. Thus, one of the features of this invention is that the use of the blunt dissector enables the separation of the node from the adjacent fragile tissue so that it can be nudged or otherwise moved to a safer location, whereupon the fingers can be extended for positively securing the node to the probe. Once that has been accomplished the node can be readily removed from the patient&apos;s body by merely withdrawing the probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the overwhelming majority of times, the sentinel lymph node is not so intimately attached to some tissue that one is worried about damage to adjacent tissue upon removal of the node. However, in some cases the adjacent tissue is quite susceptible to injury so blunt dissection will be very helpful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the sheath is preferably disposable so that after use on the probe it can be discarded. A new sheath can then be used on the probe to effect another tissue localization and removal procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred aspect of this invention, the extendable arm <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is preferably formed of a light-transmissive material so that when it is extended it can be used to carry light down its length to illuminate the operative situs. If desired, the balloon <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can also be light-transmissive to further enhance the illumination of the operative situs. That situs can be visualized either directly (in the case where the sheath and probe are used in a cut-down surgical procedure) or indirectly via the sheath itself (in the case of where the sheath and probe are introduced via a small percutaneous incision or portal to the operative situs). To the latter end, the sheath <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> preferably includes a fiber optic bundle or single optic light pipe <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, such as has been employed heretofore in conjunction with surgical trocars to allow visualization of the tip of the sheath/probe combination. The light pipe <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may include an angled light receiving distal end face (not shown) which is arranged to be extended out of a passageway <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> in the sheath&apos;s sidewall <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>A and directed toward the operative situs, like shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Thus, light carried to the operative situs by the light-transmissive arm <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can illuminate the area contiguous with the tip of the sheath so that an image of the tagged node and adjacent tissue can be carried back by the light pipe <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to some means (not shown) either within the probe or outside of it, e.g., a video monitor, to visually display that situs to the surgeon. Visual inspection of the lymph node at the tip of the instrument is particularly valuable if a blue dye technique is used in conjunction with the radiopharmaceutical used to tag the tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The material making up the balloon <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may be either elastic or inelastic. In either case, the balloon is arranged to be inflated so that it can be extended outward from the arm a substantial distance, e.g., 10 mm. Moreover, the balloon is arranged to be either partially or fully inflated to achieve whatever amount of extension is desired for bluntly dissecting the tissue. This feature is a particular importance in order to ensure that tissue adjacent to the radioactively tagged tissue which may be susceptible to injury upon removal of the radioactively tagged tissue is protected from injury. For example, if the radioactively tagged tissue is a sentinel lymph node which is located immediately adjacent or on top of a vein or the brachial plexus of nerves, the blunt dissection device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be utilized to gently lift the node off of the vein/nerves. Once the node is off the vein/nerves, the extendable members <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> can be extended outward from their fully retracted position to an extended position like shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> to entrap or ensnare the node in the same manner as described heretofore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The sheath <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may also include any of the features of the sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described earlier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, there is shown an alternative embodiment of an instrument constructed in accordance with this invention. In particular, the instrument comprises a radiation detecting probe <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> constructed like probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A but also including a blunt dissecting device <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, plural extendable tissue-entrapping members <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, and visualization means like those described as part of the sheath <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. To that end, the blunt dissector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is made up of an extendable arm <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> on which an inflatable balloon <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is mounted. The arm <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and balloon <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> are constructed and operate similarly to the arm <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the balloon <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The tissue entrapping members <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> are also constructed and operate similarly to the fingers <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The probe <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also includes the light pipe <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, which is constructed and operates similarly to the light pipe <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the probe <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown after the tagged tissue, e.g., the sentinel lymph node, has been localized during the process of gently lifting it off of adjacent tissue (not shown) by means of its blunt dissecting device <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> the probe <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown in the process of ensnaring (in this case, piercing) the freed tagged tissue (lymph node) to secure it to the distal end of the probe so that it can be removed from the patient&apos;s body. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> the probe <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown with the blunt tissue dissection device and tissue ensnaring fingers working in conjunction to secure the freed tagged tissue (lymph node) to the distal end of the probe. In particular, the inflated balloon is retracted toward the probe tip to sandwich the node between it and the tip while the fingers are used to ensnare the node. This cooperation between the balloon and fingers provides enhanced securement of the tissue to the probe and may be indicated in some node removal procedures. Lastly, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> the probe <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown with its blunt dissection device being used by itself to secure the node to the probe tip by merely retracting the inflated balloon to sandwich the node between it and the probe&apos;s tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> there is shown another alternative embodiment of the subject invention. That embodiment consists of a fully integrated instrument <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, i.e., a probe incorporating all of the features of the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> plus a blunt dissector and extendable, tissue-ensnaring fingers, in a small, light-weight easily manipulatable unit. Thus, the instrument <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> basically comprises a probe having all of the electronics and electrical components (or their equivalents) found in the probe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and the analyzer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as well as the blunt dissecting device, tissue ensnaring members and visualization means of the embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In particular, the instrument <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a radiation detector and associated components (not shown), all of the signal processing and analyzer circuitry of the analyzer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, all of the signaling circuitry, a visual (e.g., LCD) display <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, a sound generator or annunciator <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, and a self-contained power supply, e.g., a battery or battery pack (not shown). In addition the instrument <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes an extendable blunt dissection device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> comprising an extendable arm <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> on which an inflatable balloon <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is mounted. The arm <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and balloon <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> are constructed and arranged to be operated in the same manner as described with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The probe <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> also includes three extendable members or fingers <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, each having a curved distal end portion terminating in a free end <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>. Each of the fingers is also constructed and arranged to be operated in the same manner as described above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the instrument <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be used by a surgeon or other medical practitioner to localize the radioactively tagged tissue by manipulating the probe at the operative situs while monitoring the signaling components, e.g., looking at the LCD display <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and/or listening to the sounds produced by the annunciator <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. Once the tagged tissue has been localized, e.g., it is located immediately in front of the distal end of the probe, the blunt dissection device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and/or the extendable fingers <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> can be used as described earlier to effect the securement and removal of the tagged tissue. To achieve good visualization of the procedure the arm for the balloon is transparent to carry light therethrough to illuminate the operative situs from a light source (not shown) within the instrument and powered by the instrument&apos;s internally located power supply (batteries). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> there is shown another alternative embodiment of the subject invention. That embodiment consists of an integrated probe <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> incorporating all of the features of the instrument <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, except for the signaling components. Those signaling components are in the form of an externally located display/sound unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. In particular, the unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> includes a visual display <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and associated circuitry and a sound generator or annunciator <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, each of which is constructed like the comparable components of the instrument <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> or of the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described earlier, and a wireless receiver (not shown). The wireless receiver is arranged to receive wireless signals from the probe unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> so that the system conditions can be displayed on the visual display <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> for viewing by the surgeon or other medical practitioner using the system. The wireless receiver also provides signals to drive the annunciator <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> to provide audible signals to the surgeon. The wireless receiver can be of any suitable type, e.g., an infrared (IR) receiver, a radio-frequency (RF) receiver, a light or laser receiver, an ultrasonic receiver, etc. The wireless signals which are transmitted to the receiver are produced by a corresponding wireless transmitter <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> forming a portion of the probe unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Thus, the electronic components within the probe <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> produce electrical signals representative of the operative conditions of the probe, and those signals are transmitted through the air from the probe to the remotely located unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> for production of the visual and audible signals required by the practitioner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Like the fully integrated instrument <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the probe unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes an extendable blunt dissection device <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> comprising an extendable arm <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> on which an inflatable balloon <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is mounted (and which are constructed and arranged to be operated as discussed above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>), and the three extendable fingers <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> each having a curved distal end portion terminating in a free end <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>. Each of the fingers is also constructed and arranged to be operated in the same manner as described above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The instrument <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is used by a surgeon or other medical practitioner to localize the radioactively tagged tissue by manipulating the probe at the operative situs while monitoring the signaling components, e.g., looking at the LCD display <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and/or listening to the sounds produced by the annunciator <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. Once the tagged tissue has been localized, e.g., it is located immediately in front of the distal end of the probe, the blunt dissection device <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and/or the extendable fingers <highlight><bold>538</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> can be used as described earlier to effect the securement and removal of the tagged tissue. To achieve good visualization of the procedure the arm <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> for the balloon <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is a transparent light carrying member to illuminate the operative situs in the same manner as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Even though the subject invention has been described for use in effecting the removal of cancerous tissue, it should be appreciated that the invention can be used to remove other tissue structures which have been tagged and located by the probe, and which are not cancerous. For example, various types of benign tumors or histologically benign fibrous nodular growths can also be located and removed from the body of the patient using the subject invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it should be appreciated with the devices of the subject invention are to be used to localize and remove biological structures, which if penetrated or otherwise disturbed could result in the release of unwanted materials, e.g., cancer cells, the blunt dissector can be used alone or in combination with the extending fingers, but such fingers are extended so that they encircle or entrap the tagged tissue without piercing it. Piercing of the tagged tissue, e.g., a tumor, may be acceptable in various cases, e.g., a patient having systemic metastatic cancer wherein removal of the tumor is desired for the palliative reasons, such as debulking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Instruments constructed in accordance with the subject invention may incorporate a blunt dissector in the probe or in the sheath arranged to be attached to the probe, with or without the extendable members to ensnare the tagged tissue. Similarly, instruments constructed in accordance with the subject invention may incorporate extendable members in the probe or in the sheath arranged to be attached to the probe to ensnare the tagged tissue, with or without the blunt dissector to effect separation of the tagged tissue from adjacent tissue along a tissue plane. Further still, the extending members can be arranged so that they can merely encircle or &ldquo;cage in&rdquo; the tagged tissue or can pierce that tissue. In either case the tagged tissue is entrapped or ensnared on the instrument so that it can be removed from the body of the patient by retracting the instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The use of a blunt dissection device as part of the probe or as part of a sheath for use on a probe provides a further advantage to the medical practitioner over the ability to facilitate the removal of the tagged tissue. In this regard the use of an inflatable balloon blunt dissecting device gives the practitioner the ability to assist or expedite hemostasis at the situs from which the tagged tissue has been removed. In particular, after removal of the tagged tissue by the instrument of this invention, the instrument can be reinserted to the operative situs at which time the arm carrying the inflatable balloon can be extended to position the balloon at the desired position at the operative situs, then the balloon can be inflated and held in place for a few minutes or more to close off adjacent capillaries or other blood vessels to thereby promote hemostasis. For some hemostasis-inducing applications, the balloon may be constructed so that it is capable of greater expansion, e.g., 15 mm, than used for the blunt dissection operation. Thus for those applications, the balloon may be formed of an elastic material, such as nitrile rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> While the embodiments of the invention shown in the drawing and discussed above include a single blunt dissection device, i.e., a single extendable finger having an inflatable balloon mounted thereon, such a construction is merely exemplary. Thus, instruments constructed in accordance with this invention can make use of plural blunt dissection devices and such devices may be operated independently of one another or in coordination. In a similar manner even though the embodiments of the invention shown in the drawing and discussed above include three extendable members, e.g., curved or straight fingers, to ensnare the tagged tissue, such a construction is also merely exemplary. Thus, instruments constructed in accordance with this invention can make use of a single or any number of extendable members to ensnare the tagged tissue. If plural members are used they may be operated independently of one another or in coordination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> While the extendable fingers may be either straight (e.g., linear) or curved, for most applications curved fingers are preferable. In this regard, by having the free end of the extendable fingers curve toward the distal end of the probe, the chance of unintentional penetration of adjacent tissue is reduced. To further this goal, it is also preferred that the radius of curvature of the portion of each finger contiguous with its free end is less than the one half of the diameter of the distal end of the probe so that the free end of each finger will not extend outward laterally from the distal end of the probe where it could pose a puncture hazard to adjacent tissue (i.e., the free end of each finger will be located within the bounds of the periphery of the distal end of the probe and closely adjacent the end surface of the probe or sheath, as the case may be. Moreover, it is desirable to have each extendable member have a different radius of curvature, with one finger&apos;s radius of curvature being such that the free end thereof is located immediately adjacent the central longitudinal axis of the probe, and with the other fingers&apos; respective radii of curvature being slightly smaller and slightly greater, e.g., 1 or 2 mm smaller or larger. This feature ensures that when it is desired to pierce the tagged tissue (e.g., the node) at least one of the fingers will pierce the center of it, while the others pierce it on either side, thereby effectively securing it to the probe. With this arrangement the effective piercing and securement of lymph nodes ranging from 1 mm to 15 mm in size is anticipated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The fingers may be solid or hollow to utilize the features as discussed earlier with respect to fingers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The use of a light transmissive arm for the inflatable balloon of the blunt dissection device while not mandatory is nevertheless desirable since it provides a convenient means for effecting the illumination of the operative situs. Thus, the blunt dissection device may not incorporate any means for illuminating the operative situs. Such illumination means may be provided by some other component or structure forming a portion of the instrument, alternatively no illumination means may be utilized as part of the probe or sheath. So too, the instrument need not include any light receptor, e.g., a fiber optic bundle, light pipe, or any other pick-up device for receiving an image of the operative situs, to enable indirect visualization of the operative situs (i.e., visualization via the instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Since the probes or sheaths for use on probes which constitute the subject invention can be made to be of small diameter, e.g., 5 mm to 10 mm in diameter, they are particularly suitable for use via a small percutaneous portal or opening in the patient to localize and then remove the tagged tissue, thereby accomplishing the advantages of &ldquo;minimally invasive surgery.&rdquo; Alternatively, they can be used during a conventional &ldquo;cut-down&rdquo; type of surgical procedure. For the latter type of applications it should be evident that the probes, sheaths or other instruments of this invention can be somewhat bigger in size, but still sufficiently compact and light weight to enable facile manipulation by the surgeon or other medical practitioner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Without further elaboration the foregoing will so fully illustrate our invention that others may, by applying current or future knowledge, adopt the same for use under various conditions of service. </paragraph>
