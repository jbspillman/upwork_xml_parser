<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a light amplifier for a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical transmission system, and more particularly to a light amplifier having a two-stage configuration which eliminates a wavelength-dependence of the gain of the light amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Recently, an optical communications network has increasingly been used in practice. Nowadays, it is required that the optical communications network cope with multi-media networking. A WDM system is more attractive, particularly in terms of an increase in the transmission capacity. In order to realize the WDM system, it is necessary to use a multi-wavelength light amplifier capable of amplifying a wavelength division multiplexed signal. It is required that such a multi-wavelength light amplifier does not have wavelength-dependence of the gain, which is further required not to be changed due to a variation in the power of the input light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A light amplifier is known which has an optical fiber doped with a rare-earth element and directly amplifies the input light. There has been some activity in the development of a multi-wavelength light amplifier which amplifies a wavelength division multiplexed light signal including signal components having different wavelengths (channels). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, normally, the rare-earth-element doped fiber amplifier has a very narrow range in which the gain thereof does not have the wavelength-dependence. In this regard, nowadays, there is no available light amplifier which can practically be used for the WDM system. That is, there is no available light amplifier which does not have wavelength-dependence of the gain, which is not changed due to a variation in the power of the input light. Particularly, the wavelength-dependence of the gain, which takes place when the input power changes, deteriorates the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to a particular signal. This prevents the multi-wavelength light amplifier from being used in practice. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is a general object of the present invention to provide a multi-wavelength light amplifier in which the above disadvantages are eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A more specific object of the present invention is to provide a multi-wavelength light amplifier which does not have wavelength-dependence of the gain, which is not changed due to a variation in the power of the input light. </paragraph>

The second-stage light amplifier comprises a second pump source which pumps the second light amplifying optical fiber so as to have a second gain vs wavelength characteristic having a second linear gain slope. A combination of the first and second linear gain slopes results in a flat gain vs wavelength characteristic of the multi-wavelength light amplifier. </paragraph>

The optical filter emphasizes the first linear gain slope to provide an emphasized first linear gain slope. A combination of the emphasized first linear slope and the second linear gain slope results in a flat gain vs wavelength characteristic of the multi-wavelength light amplifier. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The combination of the first-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> functions to cancel the difference between the gain of the amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the gain of the amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in each of the wavelengths of the multiplexed signal. That is, the amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have different gain vs. wavelength characteristics (which may be simply referred to as gain characteristics), which can be compensated by the combination of the amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As a result, the entire multi-wavelength light amplifier has a flat gain vs wavelength characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It will now be assumed that G<highlight><subscript>0.1 </subscript></highlight>denotes an AGC control setting level which causes the amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to have a flat gain vs wavelength characteristic in which the output spectra at the respective wavelengths of the multiplexed signal have a constant peak value. Similarly, G<highlight><subscript>0.2 </subscript></highlight>is denoted as an AGC control setting level which causes the amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to have a flat gain vs wavelength characteristic in which the output spectra at the respective wavelengths of the multiplexed signal have a constant peak value. In order to achieve the above cancellation, the practical AGC control setting levels G<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and G<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are set so that G<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>&gt;G<highlight><subscript>0.1 </subscript></highlight>and G<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&lt;G<highlight><subscript>0.2</subscript></highlight>.

For example, the gain of the amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a wavelength is large, while the gain of the amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the same wavelength as described above is small. Hence, the total gain obtained by the amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be maintained at a constant (flat) level. By combining the two amplifiers together as described above, it is possible for the multi-wavelength light amplifier to have no waveform-dependence of the gain thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The above waveform-dependence of the gain can be maintained at a constant level irrespective of a variation in the input power by the feedback loop including the light splitting coupler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the photodiode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the ALC circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The split light from the beam splitting coupler <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is applied to the photodiode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which generates an electric signal corresponding to the light level. The above electric signal is applied to the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the amount of attenuation caused therein is varied on the basis of the light level detected by the photodiode <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the light output level of the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be maintained at a constant level. The variable attenuator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be formed by using a Faraday rotator or the electro-optical effect of a lithium niobate (LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) crystal. </paragraph>

The second embodiment has the same configuration as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. According to the second embodiment of the present invention, the optical fibers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are erbium-doped (Er-doped) optical fibers, which are examples of rare-earth-element doped optical fibers. Normally, alumina (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) is added to the Er-doped optical fibers at a high concentration level. In this regard, the Er-doped optical fiber may be called a co-doped optical fiber. The Er-doped optical fiber has a substantially linear gain vs wavelength characteristic in an amplifying band about 1550 nm, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Part (a) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a gain vs wavelength characteristic obtained in the amplifying band about 1550 nm when the exciting rate is relatively high, and part (b) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a gain vs wavelength characteristic obtained in the amplifying band about 1550 nm when the exciting rate is relative low. The characteristics shown in parts (a) and (b) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are due to the characteristics of absorption/emission of Er ions in the Er-doped optical fiber with alumina added thereto at a high concentration level. The horizontal axes of the parts (a), (b) and (c) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> denote the wavelength, and the vertical axes thereof denote the gain of the Er-doped optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in part (a) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the amplifying band about 1550 nm, the fiber has a relatively high gain on the short-wavelength side, and a relatively low gain on the long-wavelength side. In other words, as the wavelength becomes shorter, the gain becomes higher. As shown in part (b) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the amplifying band about 1550 nm, the fiber has a relatively high gain on the long-wavelength side, and a relatively low gain on the short-wavelength side. In other words, as the wavelength becomes longer, the gain becomes higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to the second embodiment of the present invention, the Er-doped fiber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the first amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is long enough to increase the exciting rate and obtain the characteristic shown in part (a) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It is preferable for the first-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be a low noise figure. In this regard, the Er-doped fiber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the first-stage amplifier is used at a relatively high exciting rate. In this case, the exciting efficiency is not high. The Er-doped fiber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is used at a relatively low exciting rate. Hence, it is possible to improve the exciting efficiency of the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This contributes to reducing energy consumed in the second stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The following data has been obtained through an experiment in which the multi-wavelength light amplifier was actually produced. The light amplifier produced in the experiment was designed to amplify four wavelengths (1548 nm, 1551 nm, 1554 nm, 1557 nm). The light input level used in the experiment was selected so as to fall within the range of &minus;25 dBm through &minus;15 dBm. The gain and the gain tilt of the first-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> were respectively set to 20 dB and 1.5 dB at a maximum power of the exciting light equal to &minus;160 mW (980 nm). The second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was adjusted so as to produce, for each channel, the light output equal to &plus;7 dBm at a maximum power of the exciting light equal to &minus;100 mW (1480 nm). In this case, the multi-wavelength light amplifier has a maximum noise figure of 5.6 dB and a maximum gain tilt of 0.2 dB. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the exciting rate necessary to obtain the characteristic shown in part (c) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is lower than that necessary to obtain the characteristic shown in part (b) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Since the first-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has the characteristic shown in part (a) of FIG. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it is a low noise figure.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> According to the fifth embodiment of the present invention, the beam splitting coupler <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is replaced by a beam splitting coupler <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, which has a transparent rate vs wavelength characteristic as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A, a</cross-reference> pump source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the pump source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is coupled to the beam splitting coupler <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, symbol &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>denotes the wavelength of the pump light emitted from the source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Symbol &lgr;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>denotes the central wavelength of the multiplexed light signal. Symbols &lgr;<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>and &lgr;<highlight><subscript>sn </subscript></highlight>are wavelengths which define the band of the multiplexed light signal. A solid line shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> denotes a characteristic used for communications. Two dot lines are obtained by shifting the solid line. As indicated by the solid line, the beam splitting coupler <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> functions to pass the multiplexed signal light and prevent the pump light in the forward direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> By shifting the solid line toward the short-wavelength side as indicated by character A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the characteristic curve of the transparent rate has a slope in the band defined by the wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>and &lgr;<highlight><subscript>sn</subscript></highlight>. In this case, the highest transparent rate can be obtained at the shortest wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>s1</subscript></highlight>, and the lowest transparent rate can be obtained at the longest wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>sn</subscript></highlight>. This characteristic corresponds to the characteristic of the optical filter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> used in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. With the above configuration, the multi-wavelength light amplifier according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention has the same advantages as those of the light amplifier shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The beam splitting coupler <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be applied to the first-stage amplifier I instead of the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, the Er-doped optical fiber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the first-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is pumped backward by the pump source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> because the optical filter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is placed on the output side of the Er-doped optical fiber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A description will now be given of a multi-wavelength light amplifier according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is intended to obtain the same function as the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> without the optical filter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shown therein. In other words, the light amplifier according to the sixth embodiment is configured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, nevertheless it has the function of the light amplifier shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the sixth embodiment of the present invention, the pump source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is replaced by the pump source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> having the transparent rate characteristic indicated by B shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> in such a way that the Er-doped optical fiber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is pumped backward by the pump source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This is because the optical filter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is placed on the output side of the Er-doped optical fiber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> By shifting the solid line shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> toward the long-wavelength side as indicated by character B, the characteristic curve of the transparent rate has a slope in the band defined by the wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>and &lgr;<highlight><subscript>sn</subscript></highlight>. In this case, the highest transparent rate can be obtained at the longest wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>sn</subscript></highlight>, and the lowest transparent rate can be obtained at the shortest wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>s1</subscript></highlight>. This characteristic corresponds to the characteristic of the optical filter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> used in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. With the above configuration, the multi-wavelength light amplifier according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention has the same advantages as those of the light amplifier shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the above-mentioned third through sixth embodiments of the present invention may be combined appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a multi-wavelength light amplifier according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, parts that are the same as those shown in the previously described figures are given the same reference numbers. The light amplifier shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> has a second-stage light amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A having a configuration different from the abovementioned second-stage light amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A has an automatic power control (APC) circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The APC circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> monitors and controls the pump light emitted from the pump source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, so that the pump light can be emitted at a predetermined constant level. As has been described previously, the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> functions to maintain the amplified light output by the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the predetermined constant level. Hence, even by the automatic power control of the pump light directed to maintaining the pump light at the constant level, it is possible to maintain the output light of the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A at the predetermined constant level even if the power of the light input signal fluctuates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The first-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> has a gain vs wavelength characteristic as shown in part (a) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> has a gain vs wavelength characteristic as shown in part (b) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A does not need the couplers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>, and the photodiodes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. Hence, the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A is simpler than the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that down-sizing of the light amplifier can be facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a multi-wavelength light amplifier according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, parts that are the same as those shown in the previously described figures are given the same reference numbers. The configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> differs from the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in that the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is provided on the output side of the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> attenuates the output light signal of the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that it can be maintained at the predetermined constant level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the attenuated light signal from the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is amplified by the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the variable attenuator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> attenuates the light output signal of the second stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Hence, the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> needs a much larger amount of energy of the pump light than that used in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, except for the above, the light amplifier shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> has the same advantages as the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For example, the light amplifier shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> has a low noise figure because an increase in loss of the gain does not occur between the first-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the first-stage and second-stage amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A) are not limited to the previously described AGC (APC) circuits in order to obtain the characteristics shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. It is possible to arbitrarily combine the previously described AGC circuits. Further, it is also possible to employ other AGC circuits or equivalents thereof, which will be described below as ninth through eleventh embodiments of the present invention. It will be noted that the AGC circuit of the first-stage circuit can be selected separately from the AGC circuit of the second-stage circuit. </paragraph>

The light amplifier shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> has a first-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B and a second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, which are different from the amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The first-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B, which has a gain vs wavelength characteristic as shown in part (a) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, has a forward-direction photodiode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, which detects a spontaneous emission (SE) leaking from the side surface of the Er-doped optical fiber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The AGC circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is supplied with the output signal of the photodiode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and controls the pump power of the pump source <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>so that the amplified spontaneous emission can be maintained at a predetermined constant level. As a result of the AGC control, the gain of the front-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B can be maintained at the predetermined constant value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the second-stage amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, which has a gain vs wavelength characteristic as shown in part (b) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, has a forward-direction photodiode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, which detects the spontaneous emission leaking from a side surface of the Er-doped optical fiber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>.
