<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A working tool, in particular a soil rammer or a hammer, has two masses that may be linearly moved back and forth with respect to one another, namely a top mass which comprises a driving motor and a ramming or striking working mass which can be moved by the motor relative to the top mass by means of a crank drive and a set of springs. In order to reduce as much as possible the displacement of the top mass, an additional counterweight can be moved by the motor over at least a large part of the path of displacement of the working mass in the opposite direction thereto. The displacement of the end of the set of springs linked to the crank drive and the displacement of the counterweight are preferably offset relative to one another, with respect to the crank angle, by 180&deg; minus a phase shift derived from the construction parameters of the set of springs. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a working appliance, in particular a tamper for soil compaction or a hammer, with a tamping or beating working mass driven linearly back and forth, via a crank mechanism and a spring assembly, by a motor belonging to the upper mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Known tampers of this type are designed in such a way that the upper mass comprises approximately two thirds and the beating working mass or lower mass one third of the entire tamper mass, whilst the distances covered in each case by the upper mass and the working mass are in inverse ratio to one another. In this case, the movement of the upper mass is of the order of magnitude of 25 to 30 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This movement of the upper mass at a frequency of 10-11 Hz has adverse effects, because these vibrations are transmitted to the body of the person controlling the working appliance via a control handle, in particular to the person&apos;s hand and arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although this transmission of vibrations to the body can for the most part be damped by the skilful attachment of rubber elements, there are nevertheless also high loads on the mounted drive motor, regardless of its design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This problem also arises when the working appliance is mounted on other appliances or vehicles which may be seriously damaged by the vibrations occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The output of the tamping system depends largely on the upper mass, since too great a working mass or too high a speed of the working mass moves the upper mass excessively and aggravates the problems described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These harmful effects can be partly inhibited by increasing the upper mass, but in this case the overall weight of the tamper is increased and the power consumption of the drive motor consequently rises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> DE-A 1 925 870 discloses a tamping appliance, in which a tamping foot can be driven, via a double crank mechanism, by a motor belonging to an upper mass. The drive power is distributed via gearwheels to two intermeshing crank disks which, via associated connecting rods, in each case drive rods connected to the tamping foot. Centrifugal weights are fastened in each case to the oppositely rotating crank disks, in such a way that the horizontal components of the centrifugal forces cancel one another, whilst the vertical components are added together and counteract the vibration acting on the tamper housing due to the vibration of the tamping foot. The arrangement described has to have a bulky design due to the provision of two rods connecting the upper mass to the tamping foot and due to the meshing crank disks. The overall weight of the tamper is considerable. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The object on which the invention is based is, without any appreciable increase in the overall mass, to achieve substantial stabilization of the upper mass, whilst ensuring that the working appliance has a compact design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, this object is achieved by providing a working appliance having a countermass that counteracts vibrations induced by operation of the working mass. The countermass, which can be driven in rotation by the motor that drives the working mass, includes first and second centrifugal weights that rotate in opposite directions to one another. The first centrifugal weight which may be provided on the crank mechanism itself, rotates about an axis of rotation that is coaxial with the crank mechanism. The second centrifugal weight rotates about an axis of rotation that is at least essentially coaxial to the axis of rotation of the crank mechanism. However, the axis of rotation of the second centrifugal weight may be offset in the direction of working mass reciprocation from the axis of rotation of the crank mechanism and the first centrifugal weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The working appliance is defined in that the second centrifugal weight is arranged rotatably about an axis of rotation arranged essentially coaxially to the axis of rotation of the crank mechanism. The first centrifugal weight is coaxial with or seated directly on the axis of rotation of the crank mechanism, and the second centrifugal weight is arranged behind the first centrifugal weight and has approximately the same flywheel moment as the first centrifugal weight. The second centrifugal weight is driven in the opposite direction to the first centrifugal weight about an axis of rotation that is offset somewhat relative to the axis of rotation of the crank mechanism and parallel to the direction of movement of the working mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention the countermass can be moved linearly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> back and forth, parallel to the direction of movement of the working mass, with a phase shift unequal to 180&deg; in relation to the movement of the working mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The upper mass is pressed upward by a crank mechanism at the moment when the crank mechanism presses the working mass and, therefore, the tamping foot downward via the connecting rod of said crank mechanism, a guide piston and a spring assembly. The result of the spring assembly is that, during the downward movement of the guide piston, the springs are first tensioned, so as to absorb energy, whereupon, with a delay caused thereby, they subsequently discharge the stored energy again for the downward load on the tamping foot. This delay must be taken into account when the movement of the countermass is to be coordinated as accurately as possible with the movement of the working mass. When the working mass is drawn upward again by the crank pin of the crank mechanism, the upper mass is moved downward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In a further advantageous refinement, therefore, the movement of the spring assembly end connected to the crank mechanism and the movement of the countermass are offset relative to one another with respect to the crank angle by 180&deg; minus a phase shift derived from the design parameters of the spring assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> By means of the crank mechanism, an oscillating movement of the upper mass relative to the working mass is built up, and only when the crank connected to the spring assembly goes past its vertex facing the spring assembly is the energy stored until then in the spring assembly released as tamping or beating energy, so that the countermovement of the countermass for damping the movement of the upper mass is required only at this moment, that is to say the movement of the countermass into its position furthest away from the working mass is to take place only when the crank connected to the spring assembly has passed through this vertex facing the spring assembly. This is achieved by means of the phase shift described above, which, in practice, must be coordinated at least approximately with the design parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to an expedient refinement, the countermass is guided on the upper mass in parallel with the direction of movement of the working mass. In this case, in an advantageous embodiment, the countermass is driven by a compensating eccentric on the crank mechanism, specifically, for example, via a connecting rod. According to another expedient refinement, the connection between the countermass and the compensating eccentric may be designed as a slider crank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to another expedient variant, the countermass consists of two part masses arranged in each case on one side of the crank mechanism and the other at approximately the same height with respect to the axis of rotation of the crank mechanism, and each part mass is driven by an eccentric pin on an eccentric disk assigned to the part mass and rotatably coupled to the crank mechanism, the connection between the eccentric pin and the associated part mass being designed in each case as a slider crank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In a further advantageous variant, the countermass consists of flyweights which are mounted on the upper mass rotatably about mutually parallel axes and are driven in rotation in opposite directions by the crank mechanism and the flywheel moment and mutual phase relationship of which are organized in such a way that they generate an oscillation directed in counteraction to the working mass, a further refinement being that the countermass consists of two centrifugal weights which are arranged symmetrically to the direction of movement of the working mass next to one another at about the same height in this direction and which are directly coupled to one another so as to be rotatable in opposite directions and are driven by the crank mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In another expedient embodiment for avoiding lateral forces, the countermass consists of a first centrifugal weight seated directly on the shaft of the crank mechanism and of two second centrifugal weights arranged symmetrically to the direction of movement of the working mass next to one another at about the same height in this direction and having flywheel moments equal to one another, such centrifugal weights being driven rotatably by the crank mechanism in the opposite direction to the first centrifugal weight and their flywheel moment in each case being about half the flywheel moment of the first centrifugal weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In yet another variant, the countermass consists of a first centrifugal weight seated directly on the axis of rotation of the crank mechanism and of a second centrifugal weight which is arranged behind said first centrifugal weight and which has about the same flywheel moment as the first centrifugal weight and which is driven in the opposite direction to the first centrifugal weight about an axis of rotation offset somewhat, parallel to the direction of movement of the working mass, relative to the axis of rotation of the crank mechanism. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the tamper shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and designated as a whole by <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the control handle is not illustrated for the sake of clarity. The tamper <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> terminates at the bottom in a tamping foot <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which can execute a back-and-forth movement in the direction of the movement axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> relative to the crank housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in the upper region of the tamper <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the outer cladding of the appliance therefore having a concertina-like portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> consisting of elastic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A drive motor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fastened to one side of the crank housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, said drive motor driving a drive shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provided with a toothed pinion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is in engagement with a circumferentially toothed crank disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The crank disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> carries two crank pins <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) offset at approximately <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>&deg;. The crank pin <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is connected, via a yoke-shaped connecting rod <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> surrounding the drive shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to a guide piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is arranged movably in the direction of the axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a piston guide <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connected to the crank housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and, being concealed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by the concertina-like portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is connected to the tamping foot <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a spring assembly. Connected via a connecting rod <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the crank pin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> serving as a compensating eccentric is a piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is likewise arranged movably in the direction of the axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a piston guide <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and, together with the connecting rod <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, forms the countermass, provided according to the invention, to the working mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An angular distance of 180&deg; is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> between the crank pins <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The piston or countermass <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> would consequently reach top dead center when the guide piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connected to the spring assembly, not shown, reaches its bottom dead center. For the reasons already described, however, the piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is to reach top dead center with a time delay, depending on the design features of the spring assembly, and therefore the angular distance must be selected smaller than 180&deg; by the amount of a particular phase shift angle. In practice, this phase shift angle may be 70-100&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the variant illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the crank disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, in engagement with the toothed pinion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, on the drive shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is provided with a crank <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> bent so as to form the crank pins <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The crank pin <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, which forms the free end of the crank <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, engages into a sliding block <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> arranged dispaceably in a guide slot <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> formed in a piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>serving as a countermass. The piston <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is guided movably parallel to the axis of movement <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a guide <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>formed on the crank housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The connecting rod <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, configured for connection to the guide piston (not shown) and transmitting the movement to the spring assembly, is mounted on the crank pin <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The functioning of this variant corresponds largely to the design according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. However, because the countermass is driven by a slider crank mechanism, this embodiment makes it possible to have a design which is shortened in the direction of the axis of movement <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a variant which likewise provides a slider crank drive for the countermass, the arrangement making further shortening possible.

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> show a final variant which is a development of the variant according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> in as much as the two disks <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>rotating in the same direction are replaced, in this case, by a single disk <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>.

A centrifugal weight <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is provided on the disk <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and, therefore, is arranged rotatably about an axis of rotation that is offset from the axis of rotation of the crank disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>. Another centrifugal weight <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is mounted directly on the crank disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>and, therefore, rotates about the axis of the crank disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>. Alternatively, disk <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> could be configured to rotate about an axis that is at least essentially coaxial with the axis of crank disk <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
