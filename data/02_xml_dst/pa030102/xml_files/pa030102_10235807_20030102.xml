<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an active matrix type liquid display system such as a display unit used in a personal computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The conventional active matrix type crystal display system has used transparent electrodes formed on the interfaces between the liquid crystal and two substrates facing to each other as electrodes driving a liquid crystal layer. The cause is that the conventional active matrix type crystal display system has employed a twisted nematic display type in which liquid crystal is driven by directing the electric field applied to the liquid crystal in the direction approximately perpendicular to the interfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, an active matrix type liquid crystal display system has been proposed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 56-91277 (1981) in which liquid crystal is driven by directing the electric field applied to the liquid crystal in the direction approximately parallel to the interfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the conventional technology employing the twisted nematic display type described above, it is required to form a transparent electrode such as indium tin oxide (ITO) typical. However, since the transparent electrode has an unevenness of approximately several ten nm on its surface, it becomes difficult to fabricate a fine active element such as thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;TFT&rdquo;). Further, since the projected part of the transparent electrode is often apt to be detached and mixed into other parts such as electrode, the yield of the products has been largely decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, there have been a lot of problems on the aspect of image quality in the conventional technology. Especially, it has been difficult to obtain a halftone display since change in brightness is large when the view direction is changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Still further, in the active matrix type liquid crystal display system using switching transistor elements, it is required to provide a scanning electrode and a signal electrode for driving the switching transistor elements in addition to a pixel electrode for applying voltage or electric field to liquid crystal to modulate transmitted light or reflected light. The scanning electrode and the signal electrode fluctuate the voltage in the pixel electrode through the parasitic capacitance C<highlight><subscript>gs </subscript></highlight>between the scanning electrode and the pixel electrode and the parasitic capacitance C<highlight><subscript>ds </subscript></highlight>between the signal electrode and the pixel electrode. In particular, since the voltage in the signal electrode is always fluctuated by image information, the voltage in the pixel electrode is fluctuated through the parasitic capacitance C<highlight><subscript>ds </subscript></highlight>between the signal electrode and the pixel electrode to decrease the contrast or to produce a bad image called as cross-talk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the type in which the electric field applied to the liquid crystal in the direction approximately parallel to the interfaces of the substrates, there has been problem that the parasitic capacitance C<highlight><subscript>ds </subscript></highlight>between the signal electrode and the pixel electrode becomes large comparing to the case of the twisted nematic display type, the cross-talk being large, the contrast being decreased depending on the image pattern. The cause is that since a common electrode in the type applying the electric field to the liquid crystal in the direction approximately parallel to the interfaces of the substrates is not formed over the whole surface of the substrate facing against the substrate having switching transistor elements different from in the case of the twisted nematic display type, the line of electric force from the signal electrode is not shielded and is terminated at the pixel electrode. Therefore, in the type applying the electric field to the liquid crystal in the direction approximately parallel to the interfaces of the substrates, the active matrix driving has a disadvantage in image quality. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In order to help understanding the present invention, the operation of the present invention will be described below before describing embodiments, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a cross-sectional view showing a single unit of pixel in the liquid crystal cell according to the present invention, each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) being a plan view of the single unit of the pixel. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, an active element is omitted. Further, although scanning electrodes and signal electrodes are formed in a matrix shape to construct a plurality of pixels in the present invention, a part of a single unit of pixel is shown here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a cross-sectional side view of the cell without applying voltage, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is a plan view in that time. A stripe-shaped pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a stripe-shaped common electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a stripe-shaped signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a stripe-shaped shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed inside a pair of transparent substrates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, orientational ordering films <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (orientational ordering direction <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) being formed thereon, a liquid crystal composition material being interposed between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When no electric field is applied to the pixel electrode and the common electrode, the rod-shaped liquid crystal molecules <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are aligned in such a direction as to have a certain angle to the longitudinal direction of the stripe the angle between shaped electrodes, that is, 45 degrees&lE;&verbar; the direction of the electric field and the direction of the major axis of the liquid crystal molecules (optical axis) in the vicinity of the interface &verbar;&lE;90 degrees. Explanation will be made here on a case where the directions of the orientational ordering of the liquid crystal molecules at the upper and lower interfaces are parallel to each other. The dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal composition material is assumed to be positive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When an electric field E is applied to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the common electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the liquid crystal molecules change their orientation to the direction of the electric field E as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). By means of placing the polarization transmitting axis <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of polarization plates <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so as to form a given angle to the direction of the electric field, the percentage of transmitting light can be varied corresponding to the electric field applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, as described above, a display having contrasts can be realized without transparent electrode. For practical structures to produce the contrasts, there are the following two modes: a mode utilizing the state of the orientational ordering of the liquid crystal molecules on the upper and the lower substrates being nearly parallel to each other (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;double refraction mode&rdquo;, since this mode utilizes the interference light due to double refraction phase difference), and a mode utilizing the state of the direction of orientational order of the liquid crystal molecules on the upper and lower substrates being crossed each other and of the alignment of the molecules inside the cell being twisted (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;optical rotation mode&rdquo;, since this mode utilizes the optical rotation of polarization surface being rotated inside the liquid crystal composition layer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the double refracting mode, with applying voltage the orientation of the major axes of the molecules (optical axes) is changed on the plane keeping parallel to the surface of the substrates, the percentage of transmission light is changed due to change in the angle between the major axes of the molecules and the axes (absorbing axes or transmitting axes) of the polarized plates <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> set in a given angle. Although, in the optical rotation mode, with applying voltage the orientation of the major axes of the molecules is also changed, this mode utilizes the change in optical rotation due to untwisting the spirals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the display mode where the direction of the electrical field applying to the liquid crystal is nearly parallel to the interface of the substrates, the major axes of the liquid crystal molecules are always nearly parallel to the surfaces of substrates and not perpendicular to the surface. Therefore, the change in brightness is small when view angle is changed so-called, view angle (independence of view angle), that is characteristic is excellent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> This display mode obtains the dark state not through making the double refraction phase difference of zero by applying voltage like a conventional mode, but obtains the dark state through changing the angle between the major axes of the liquid crystal molecules and the axes (absorbing axes or transmitting axes) of a polarization plates. The operation of this mode is basically different from the conventional one. In a case such as the conventional TN type where the major axes of the liquid crystal molecules are raised perpendicular to the interface of the substrates, the view direction making the double refraction phase difference of zero is the right front, that is, the direction perpendicular to the interface of the substrate. And the double refraction appears when the view angle inclines even a little. Therefore, in a normally open type, light leaks to cause decrease in the contrast and reversal in the halftone level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Another important operation of the liquid crystal display system according to the present invention will be described below. When the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is constructed in adjacent to the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the line of electric force from the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> terminates at the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the parasitic capacitance C<highlight><subscript>ds </subscript></highlight>between the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, expressed as the following equation, is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>C</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>dS</subscript></highlight>&equals;(2&egr;/&pgr;)1<highlight><italic>n&lcub;</italic></highlight>1&plus;(<highlight><italic>W/d</italic></highlight>)&rcub;,&emsp;&emsp;&lsqb;1&rsqb;</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> where W is the width (length in the short side direction) of the pixel electrode, d being the distance between the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, &egr; being the dielectric constant of the medium between the electrodes, &pgr; being the circular constant, and the parasitic capacitance C<highlight><subscript>ds </subscript></highlight>indicates the capacitance per unit length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Here, it is assumed that the dielectric constant above of the medium between the electrodes is a constant value, the width of the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being equal to or wider than the width of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display system according to the present invention, since a shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided between the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, most of the lines of electric force terminates at the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When voltage is applied to the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to keep the voltage in the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> externally, the parasitic capacitance C<highlight><subscript>ds </subscript></highlight>between the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> drastically decreases. Therewith, since the voltage in the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> does not change even when the voltage in the signal electrode changes, the cross-talk does not appear. Thus, the display mode can be applied to the active matrix system, and consequently it is possible to obtain a liquid crystal display system having an excellent view angle characteristic, a high contrast and a high image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Further, since the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may also serve as a light shielding layer (black matrix), there is no need to form any extra shielding layer and any transparent electrode, which improves its production yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the shield electrode may also serve as a common electrode and consequently the shield electrode can utilize the area to be occupied by the common electrode to improve its opening ratio, which makes it possible to attain high brightness or low power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described below, referring to embodiments. In the display panel surface of the liquid crystal display system in the embodiments below, it will be defined that the vertical direction is the direction parallel to the longitudinal direction of the signal electrodes (perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the scanning electrodes), the horizontal direction being the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the signal electrodes (parallel to the longitudinal direction of the scanning electrodes), the direction of rows of the matrix electrodes being parallel to the vertical direction, the direction of columns being parallel to the horizontal direction. Further, it is assumed that the number of pixels is 640(&times;3)&times;480, the pitch between the pixels being 110 &mgr;m in the row direction and 330 &mgr;m in the column direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Embodiment 1&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a schematic view of a pixel part of a liquid crystal display system according to the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a schematic cross-sectional view, taken along the plane of line A-A&prime; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the structure of a drive system of the liquid crystal display system in the embodiment according the present invention. Therein, glass substrates having thickness of 1.1 mm polished their surfaces are used as substrates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> made of chromium are formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the horizontal direction. Signal electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> made of chromium/aluminum are formed in intersecting at right angle to the scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Further, the pixels are formed of thin film transistor (TFT) elements using an amorphous silicon <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a part of the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (serving as a gate electrode), a part of the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (serving as a drain electrode or a source electrode) and a pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (serving as a source electrode or a drain electrode). A silicon nitride film is used for a gate insulation film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the TFT element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed on the same layer, in the same process and of the same material as those of the signal electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> such that its longitudinal direction comes in the vertical direction. An n&plus;type amorphous silicon <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed between the amorphous silicon <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and between the amorphous silicon <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to make ohmic contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A common electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed in a stripe-shape on the same layer, in the same process and of the same material as those of the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the signal electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and is directed toward the vertical direction to be connected to a common line as well as the common electrodes in the other rows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The orientation of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer is controlled mainly by the electric field E applied in the horizontal direction between the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the common electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Light passes through between the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the common electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, entering into the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to be modulated. Therefore, it is not necessary that the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is limited to have transparency (for example, transparent electrode such as ITO). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> On the TFT element there is formed a silicon nitride protecting film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for protecting the TFT element. A shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;opposite substrate&rdquo;) being opposite to the substrate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;TFT substrate&rdquo;) having the group of TFT elements. On this occasion, the shield electrode&rsqb;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed so as to be placed between the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a stripe-shape, and is directed toward the vertical direction to be connected to a common line as well as the shield electrodes in the other rows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Further, on the opposite substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, there is formed in the vertical direction a color filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> composed of three colors, R, G, B, being stripe-shaped. On the color filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a flattening film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made of a transparent resin is laminated to flatten the surface. Epoxy resin is used as the material for the flattening film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, orientation control films <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> made of polyimide group resin are formed through spreading on the flattening film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the protecting film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A nematic liquid crystal composition <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is interposed between the substrates <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The nematic crystal composition has a dielectric anisotropy &Dgr;&egr; of positive value of 7.3, and a double refraction &Dgr;n of 0.073 (589 nm, 20&deg; C.). Although the liquid crystal having a dielectric anisotropy &Dgr;&egr; of positive value is used, a liquid crystal having a dielectric anisotropy &Dgr;&egr; of negative value may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The orientation control films <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are treated in rubbing process to make its pre-tilting angle in 1.0 degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The directions of rubbing on the upper and the lower interfaces are parallel to each other, and the angle between the rubbing direction and the applied electric field E is 85 degrees. The gap (d) between the upper and the lower substrates is 4.5 &mgr;m under the state of containing the liquid crystal by means of dispersing and interposing spherical polymer beads between the substrates. Therewith, the value &Dgr;n&middot;d becomes 0.329 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The panel above is sandwiched with two polarization plates (a product of Nitto Denkou Co.; type G1220DU) (polarization plates are not shown in the figure). The axis of polarization transmission in one of the polarization plate is set in the direction nearly parallel to the rubbing direction (85 degrees), the axis of polarization transmission in the other polarization plate is set in intersecting nearly at right angle with the above axis (&minus;5 degrees). Therewith, a liquid crystal display system having normally closed characteristic is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Next, a vertical scanning circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a image signal drive circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are connected to the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the liquid crystal display system is driven with active matrix drive by means of supplying scanning signal voltage, image signal voltage, timing signal, common electrode voltage and shield electrode voltage from a power source and a control circuit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, the shield electrode voltage and the common electrode voltage are independent from each other, the shield electrode voltage is supplied by being electrically connected from the TFT substrate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to the shield electrode on the opposite electrode using silver paste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Although, in the embodiment, the amorphous silicon TFT elements are used, poly-silicon TFT elements may be used. In a case of reflection type display system, MOS transistors formed on a silicon wafer may be used The materials for wiring are also not limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Further, although the orientation control film is provided in the embodiment, the flattening film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may serve also as an orientation control film by means of directly rubbing the surface of the flattening film. Similarly, epoxy resin may be used for the protection film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for the TFT elements and may be performed with rubbing treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the relationship between the applied voltage to the liquid crystal and the brightness in the embodiment. The contrast ratio becomes above 150 at 7V driving. When view angle is changed in the lateral and the perpendicular directions, the difference in the contrast ratio curve is very small comparing to the conventional method, and the display characteristic does not change when view angle is changed. On addition to these, the orientation of the liquid crystal is excellent, and no domain due to orientational failure appears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the change in the curve of the brightness versus the signal voltage V<highlight><subscript>sig </subscript></highlight>depending on the difference in the wave form of the signal electrode voltage V<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>in the embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows the voltage wave form, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) showing the change in curve of the signal voltage V<highlight><subscript>sig </subscript></highlight>versus the brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> After the scanning electrode voltage V<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>is turned on and the signal voltage V<highlight><subscript>sig </subscript></highlight>is written in, the signal electrode voltage V<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>is changed. However, no significant change in the curve of the signal voltage V<highlight><subscript>sig </subscript></highlight>versus the brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the embodiment, the strength of transmitting light can be modulated without using transparent electrode, and the view angle characteristic can be substantially improved. It is possible to obtain a liquid crystal display system which can suppress the cross-talk in the vertical direction, that is a disadvantage in the method where the electric field is applied parallel to the interface of the substrate, and is high in through-put, high in product yield, wide in view angle, high in contrast and high in image quality. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Further, from the view point of image quality, the crosstalk in the vertical direction appears and the substantial decrease in contrast is caused as shown in the curve V<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>&prime; in the figure. </paragraph>

The structural feature of the embodiment is in the point that a shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed to cover the whole part of light transmission part between the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the signal electrode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and between the common electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the signal electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Therewith, the light leakage is not caused without light shielding layer, and high contrast can be attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Further, since the surface above the amorphous silicon <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is also covered with the light shielding layer, there is no increase in the leak current in the amorphous silicon due to light and it is realized to obtain an excellent display characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A slit-shaped opening part is provided on the signal electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>not to increase the capacitance between the signal electrode and the shield electrode as small as possible, and the overlap with the signal electrodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is minimized so as to become only the over-lap of the margin for adjusting accuracy. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Therewith, there is no need to add another process for making the shield electrode.

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The strength of electric field varies depending on the distance between the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A problem arises in that the deviation in the distance between the pixel electrode and the shield electrode causes the deviation in the brightness. Therefore, a high accuracy is required in alignment of the pixel electrodes and the common electrodes. In a method where two substrates having electrodes each are bonded together, the alignment accuracy is worse than the alignment accuracy for the photo-mask by two to three times.

The structural feature of the embodiment is in the point that the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed of the same material, on the same layer and in the same process as the scanning electrodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are formed, and the electrode is extended in the horizontal direction to connect to a common line to which the common electrodes in the other rows are connected. The liquid crystal molecules are controlled by the electric field E between the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, its longitudinal direction being in the vertical direction, and the projected portion projecting toward the vertical direction from the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Therewith, there is no need to add another process for making the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, there is no need to provide any through hole like Embodiment 8, and consequently the connection failure between the common electrodes is eliminated. Since in the embodiment the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed on the identical substrate, the alignment accuracy between the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is high. </paragraph>

Thereby, similar to Embodiment 5, the light leakage is not additionally caused without light shielding layer, and high contrast can be attained. Further, since the distance between the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the projection of the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> becomes large, the area of light transmission portion (opening ratio) between the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the projection of the shield electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is increased to improve the transmission ratio. Although connection of the shield electrode in this embodiment is made in such a manner as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the connecting portion is not limited to that. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the embodiment, the same effect as Embodiment <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be attained, and further it is possible to obtain an active matrix liquid crystal display system being high in through-put and high in fabrication yield. </paragraph>

Here, the signal wire <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is covered with a projection projecting from the scanning wire <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the precedent stage toward the longitudinal direction of the signal wire to shield the electric field applied between the signal wire <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Since the electric potential in the scanning wire is constant except during scanning duration, the electric potential in the pixel electrode cannot be fluctuated. Therewith, the fluctuation in the electric potential in the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> due to variation in the electric potential in the signal wire varied by the image signal is eliminated, and a stable display can be obtained. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view being along the line C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In order to stabilize the electric potential in the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an accumulating capacitance is constructed with the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the scanning wire <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the precedent stage and the gate insulation film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, since the pixel electrode is not necessary to be transparent and a commonly used metallic electrode can be used, it is possible to obtain an active matrix type liquid crystal display system which is high in fabrication yield and suitable for mass production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Further, it is possible to obtain an active matrix type liquid crystal display system which is excellent in view angle characteristic and easy in multi-halftone display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Especially, by means of forming the shield electrode, the parasitic capacitance between the signal electrode and the pixel electrode can be decreased and it is possible to obtain an active matrix type liquid crystal display system which is high in contrast and high in image quality without cross-talk. The compatibility of the above two effects can be attained. Furthermore, since the shield electrode serves also as a common electrode, the number of fabrication processes can be decreased. </paragraph>
