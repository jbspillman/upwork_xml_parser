<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to equipment for manufacturing semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to a process chamber used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, capable of reducing contamination by particulates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, integrated circuits (ICs) are manufactured on semiconductor wafers formed of, for example, silicon. During the manufacture of the ICs, a series of steps, for example, photo masking, deposition of material layers, oxidation, nitridation, ion implantation, diffusion and etching, are conducted to obtain a final product. Most of these steps are carried out in a process chamber. Thus, reducing contamination by particulate in the process chamber has been recognized as a critical factor for determining the quality of a semiconductor device. Particulates are generated in a process chamber depending on the structure of the process chamber, the material used to form the chamber, and the types of reaction gases used in the chamber. In general, the process chamber is contaminated by particulates due to the following two reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The first reason, which usually occurs in a process chamber used for etching, is the difference in temperature between edge rings (or focus rings) near a semiconductor wafer and the parts from which the process chamber is constructed. The second reason, which usually occurs in a process chamber used for a deposition process, is the unsmooth flow of a reaction gas near guide rings for guiding the edge of a semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view illustrating the generation of particulates in a process chamber during an etching process. In detail, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a sectional view illustrating an electrostatic chuck supporting a semiconductor wafer in a conventional process chamber for an etching process using plasma. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of the edge (portion A) of the semiconductor wafer shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> holds a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using electrostatic adsorption. Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> power supply for supplying a high voltage is connected to the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to induce static electricity. Lift pins <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for moving the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> up and down when loading or unloading the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, pass through the center of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The lift pins <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are in contact with a support plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> installed below the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The support plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> moves upwards in response to force applied by an external lifter (not shown), in a direction indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The lift pins <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> move upwards in response to upward movement of the support plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Then, the lift pins <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> protrude past the surface of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supported by the lift pins <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is separated from the surface of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Edge rings <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are installed at the upper edges of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to fix the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the edge ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is separated from the edge of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a small gap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Also, there is a space <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> between part of the surface of the edge ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the periphery of the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Also, a coupling ring <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> made of aluminum (Al) is interposed between the edge ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is surrounded by a focus ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The focus ring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> draws a plasma forming region to the edge of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during the etching process, such that the plasma forming region is uniformly formed across the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, in such a conventional process chamber, plasma enters into the small gap <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> between the edge ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the edge of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and thus the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer may be etched. Polymers, which are byproducts generated by the etching, adhere to the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and bind the edge ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the edge ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is separated from the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for repair and maintenance after the process is completed, the edge ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be broken due to it being bound to the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When the etching is repeated several times, the edge ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is etched along its inner circumference, so that the gap between the edge ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes wider. As a result, the edge ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> strikes against the edge of a platen zone of the semiconductor wafer (portion B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), so that a part of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is another view illustrating the generation of particulates in a process chamber used for an etching process. In detail, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a sectional view of an electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in which a focus ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is included but not the edge ring shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is held by an electrostatic force produced by an electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, through which lift pins <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are inserted. An annular focus ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is arranged around the edge of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The focus ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> draws a plasma forming region to the edge of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during the etching process, such that the plasma forming region is uniformly formed across the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, the focus ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> acts as an edge ring, thereby preventing the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from deviating from its original position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The upper part of the focus ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is rounded, and the height of the focus ring is higher than the surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Most of the polymers generated in the process chamber accumulate on the protruding top of the focus ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Here, the amount and type of accumulated polymer varies according to the material forming the metal layer to be etched, and the distribution in temperature in the reaction chamber. For example, if a metal layer to be etched is formed of tungsten (W), an etching gas used for etching the metal layer, for example, SF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, reacts with the Al component of the process chamber and increases the concentration of Al in the process chamber, thereby generating floating particulates of Al<highlight><subscript>X</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>Y</subscript></highlight>. Also, if a metal layer to be etched is formed of Al, an etching gas used for etching the metal layer, for example, Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or BCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, generates polymers of Al<highlight><subscript>X</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>Y</subscript></highlight>. Such polymers lie on the protruding portion of the focus ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which is the farthest away from a heat source (not shown), and may fall onto the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> due to a change in internal pressure, thereby causing the process to fail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a sectional view illustrating the generation of particulates in a process chamber used for a deposition process. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a wafer support portion of a process chamber for chemical vapor deposition (CVD). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of the portion C of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is seated on a wafer chuck <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and a heater <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is placed below the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is guided by an annular guide ring <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> placed around the edge of the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. However, because a space d between the guide ring <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is very narrow, a reaction gas is stagnant in the space d and does not flow smoothly therein. As a result, the reaction gases staying in the space d react with each other abnormally, which results in the growth of an undesirable material layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The material layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may undesirably contaminate the wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As described above, a process chamber used for etching or deposition produces particulates for various reasons, increasing the likelihood of failure of the semiconductor devices on wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, it would be desirable to prevent such a failure by eliminating factors which may cause the generation of particulates in the process chamber during the manufacturing of the devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The present invention now will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the concept of the invention to those skilled in the art. In addition, Korean application nos. 98-39486 and 99-22541, filed Sep. 23, 1998 and Jun. 16, 1999, respectively, are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In accordance with more preferred embodiments of the present invention, the annular edge ring has a first side which faces the side of the semiconductor wafer and contacts the side of the semiconductor wafer. The edge ring preferably has a first upper surface which overlaps the periphery of the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer and contacts the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer. Also, the edge ring may have a second side facing the side of the electrostatic chuck, the second side having a shape such that the contact area between the second side and the side of the electrostatic chuck is minimal. To minimize the contact area, the second side of the edge ring may be slanted such that only the edge of the second side contacts the side of the electrostatic chuck. Also, the edge ring may be fixed such that the edge ring cannot rotate. In this case, the edge ring may be fixed by a fixing pin, and may be fixed at two or more points separated from each other by a maximum distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The edge ring is preferably made of quartz, silicon or aluminum nitride. Also, the process chamber may further comprise a focus ring formed around the edge ring to make distribution of the plasma uniform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The focus ring preferably has a first upper surface which overlaps the periphery of the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer and contacts the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer. Also, the focus ring may have a second side facing the side of the electrostatic chuck, and the second side preferably has a shape such that the contact area between the second side and the side of the electrostatic chuck is minimal. To minimize the contact area, the second side of the focus ring may be slanted such that only the edge of the second side contacts the side of the electrostatic chuck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The focus ring is preferably fixed such that the edge ring cannot rotate. Also, the edge ring may be fixed by a fixing pin. In this case, the focus ring may be fixed at two or more points separated from each other by a maximum distance. Preferably, the focus ring is made of quartz, silicon or aluminum nitride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the surface temperature of the focus ring is maintained to be above at least 50&deg; C. across the entire surface of the focus ring during a reaction. To achieve this, the upper surface of the focus ring is preferably flat without protrusions, and the upper surface, which is the farthest away from a heat source, is maintained to be above the surface temperature. In this case, the thickness of the focus ring, from the flat upper surface to the base thereof, may be equal to or less than 20 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The slant angle of the gas supply path in the vertical direction is preferably at least 2 degrees, and the gas supply plate is preferably formed of quartz, silicon or aluminum nitride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Heat transfer lines are preferably formed to pass near the slit valve, and the number of the heat transfer lines formed near the slit valve is larger than the number of heat transfer lines formed passing through the sidewall. Also, the temperature of the upper part of the sidewall, which is positioned above the wafer transfer path, is the same as or higher than that of the lower part of the sidewall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the inner circumference of the guide ring comprises a first portion protruding toward the semiconductor wafer and separated from the semiconductor wafer by a first interval, and a second portion separated from the semiconductor wafer by a second interval which is longer than the first interval, to guide the semiconductor wafer. In this case, the first interval may be 0.5-1.0 mm, and the second interval may be 2-30 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In a process chamber for etching using plasma in accordance with aspects of the present invention, the edge ring (or focus ring) and a semiconductor wafer preferably contact each other firmly, such that the plasma cannot enter below the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer, thereby suppressing generation of particulates. Also, because the contact area between the edge ring (or focus ring) and the electrostatic chuck is minimized, the edge ring (or focus ring) can be easily separated from the electrostatic chuck even when particulates are generated. Also, the edge ring (or focus ring) is preferably fixed, so that bumping into the semiconductor wafer due to rotation of the edge ring can be prevented. Also, by changing the temperature distribution in the process chamber or the materials used for the process chamber, the generation of particulates, which depends on the temperature and materials of the process chamber, can be reduced such that the effect of the particulates on the semiconductor wafer can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In a process chamber for CVD, the space between the guide ring and the wafer chuck can be maintained at a predetermined level such that reaction gases flow smoothly in the space, thereby suppressing the deposition of a foreign layer by reaction gases in the space between the. guide ring and wafer chuck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a sectional view of an electrostatic chuck for supporting a semiconductor wafer in a process chamber used in the manufacture of a semiconductor device in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is an enlarged sectional view of the edge (portion D) of the semiconductor wafer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> holds a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by electrostatic adsorption. A power supply (not shown) for supplying a high voltage is connected to the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in order to induce static electricity. Lift pins <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for moving the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> up and down when loading or unloading the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, pass through the center of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The lift pins <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are in contact with a support plate <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> installed below the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The support plate <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can move upwards in response to a force applied by an external lifter (not shown), in a direction indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The lift pins <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> move upwards in response to upward movement of the support plate <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Then, the lift pins <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> protrude past the surface of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> supported by the lift pins <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is separated from the surface of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Edge rings <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are installed at the upper edge of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to fix the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Also, a coupling ring <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> made of, for example, aluminum (Al), is interposed between the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is surrounded by a focus ring <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. The focus ring <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> draws a plasma forming region to the edge of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> during the etching process, such that the plasma forming region is uniformly formed across the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there is almost no gap between the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Such a gap between the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be reduced to about 0.1-0.15 mm. However, it is preferable to reduce the gap as much as possible. Also, a space between the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the periphery of the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is reduced to a minimal distance. By minimizing the distance between the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, infiltration of parasitic plasma into the space between the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be suppressed as much as possible. Further, the edge of the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, which contacts the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is preferably slanted, forming a triangular space at the contact region. As a result, only one edge point of the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> contacts the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, so that the contact area between the edge ring and the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is minimized. Alternatively, the edge of the chuck may be slanted to create the triangular space. Thus, even when polymers accumulate at the periphery of the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a binding area between the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by the polymers is minimized, so that the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can be easily separated from the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is preferably fixed to the coupling ring <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> or the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>) by fixing pins <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. The rotation of the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is prevented by the fixing pin <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, so that damage to the semiconductor wafer, which may occur by the rotation of the edge ring <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, can also be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a sectional view of an electrostatic chuck for supporting a semiconductor wafer in a process chamber used in the manufacture of a semiconductor device in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The process chamber of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is different from that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> in that only a focus ring is used without an edge ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, an electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> holds a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> by electrostatic adsorption. A power supply (not shown) for supplying a high voltage is connected to the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in order to induce static electricity, and lift pins (not shown) which are moved when loading or unloading the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, pass through the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Also, an annular focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is installed around the edge of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> draws a plasma forming region to the edge of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> during the etching process, such that the plasma forming region is uniformly formed across the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> can also fix the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the case of only using the focus ring without the edge ring, as mentioned above, the gap between the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the space between the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the periphery of the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are both minimized. Also, the edge of the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, facing the upper side of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, is preferably slanted to reduce the contact area between the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> as much as possible. Alternatively, the edge of the chuck may be slanted to create the triangular space. By doing so, the area between the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, which is bound by polymers can be minimized, so that the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> can be easily separated from the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> without damage to the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Also, the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is fixed to the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> by fixing pins <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Because the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is fixed, the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> does not rotate even though the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is spaced further apart from the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. As a result, bumping of the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> into the semiconductor wafer can be minimized or prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In general, the upper surface of the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is partially etched during the etching process, so that the lifetime of the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is shortened. In general, because the thickness d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may affect the processing result, the thickness of the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> must be restricted. The thickness d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> which is widely in use, is approximately 3.6 mm. However, in the this embodiment, the thickness d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the focus ring was increased to approximately 4.5 mm. As a result, the lifetime of the focus ring <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> was increased by about 2-3 times, without affecting the processing result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a focus ring in a process chamber used in the manufacture of a semiconductor device in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> focus ring <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> used in a process chamber used in the manufacture of a semiconductor device is installed around the edge of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and has an annular shape, such that the focus ring <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is separated from the edge of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by a predetermined distance. However, a portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>&prime; of the focus ring <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> contacts firmly with the periphery of the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in order to prevent parasitic plasma from infiltrating into the space between the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the focus ring <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The total height d<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the focus ring <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is half that of the conventional focus ring. For example, assuming that the total height of the conventional focus ring from the base to the protruding portion is approximately 30 mm, the total height d<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the focus ring used in a process chamber for manufacturing a semiconductor device can be less than 20 mm, preferably approximately 15 mm. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the upper surface of the focus ring can be flattened by removing the protruding portion from a conventional focus ring (drawn with dashed lines), such that the temperature distribution across the surface of the focus ring <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> becomes uniform. In the case of adopting such a focus ring, the amount of polymer accumulated on the focus ring varies according to the difference in temperature of the focus ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a graph showing the amount of adhered polymer with respect to the temperature at the surface of the focus ring. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, at a portion of the focus ring at below 50&deg; C. (hereinafter, referred to as portion A), the amount of adhered polymer is the largest and the adhering status is also very poor. Polymer also adheres to a portion of the focus ring at 50&tilde;55&deg; C. (hereinafter, referred to as portion B). However, the amount of polymer adhering to the portion B is less than that adhering to the portion A, and the adhesion status is better than in the portion A. However, polymers do not adhere to a portion of the focus ring, at a temperature higher than 60&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The amount of polymers adhering to the focus ring and the adhesion status of the polymers vary according to the difference in temperature at the surface of the focus ring. The reason for the occurrence of a temperature difference in the focus ring is that the distance from a heat source to each portion of the focus ring is different. In general, a heater is installed below an electrostatic chuck as a heat source. Thus, the temperature of the focus ring is the highest at the base, and the temperature of the focus ring decreases toward the upper portion of the focus ring. Thus, the largest amount of polymers adheres to the upper protruding portion of the focus ring having the lowest temperature, and the adhesion status of the polymers at the upper portion is worst. In addition, a semiconductor wafer is placed adjacent to the protruding portion of the focus ring, and the semiconductor wafer can be deteriorated by the large amount of polymers which are poorly adhered to the focus ring. However, in the focus ring which is flattened by removing the upper protruding portion having the lowest temperature, the temperature can be evenly distributed over the focus ring. Here, the thickness of the focus ring is controlled such that the temperature of the focus ring is maintained at above 60&deg; C., thereby reducing the amount of loosely adhered polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Such a change in the adhesion status of polymers due to the difference in temperature of each portion of the focus ring can be applied to other parts. The change in adhesion status of the polymer in other parts of the process chamber will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing a sidewall of a process chamber used for manufacturing a semiconductor device in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> slit valve <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> for transferring a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> is installed in a sidewall <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> attached to an external wall <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the process chamber. The sidewall <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is formed of anodized aluminum (Al) and liners <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are attached to the sidewall <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, facing the inner space of the process chamber. The liners <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are for preventing polymers from adhering to the sidewall <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of the process chamber. The semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> is guided by a focus ring <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> placed on the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, and the liners <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are separated from the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> by a predetermined distance d<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. In such a process chamber, a heater is placed below the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> as a heat source. Thus, the temperatures of the liners <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>vary according to their height. For example, temperature of the lower liner <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>which is closer to the heater, is higher than that of the upper liner <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>which is farther from the heater. Thus, as described above, a larger amount of polymers accumulate on the upper liner <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>than on the lower liner <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and the adhesion status of polymers is poorer in the upper liner <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>If the upper liner <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is placed above a wafer transfer path, the polymer adhering to the upper liner <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may fall onto the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. Thus, by controlling the temperature of the upper liner <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so that is not lower than the temperature of the lower liner <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the possibility of failure in the process can be lowered. In the same manner, the temperature of the slit valve <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, which forms the wafer transfer path, can be increased as much as possible, thereby preventing the slit valve <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> from being contaminated by the polymers. To accomplish this increase in temperature, more heat transfer lines passing near the slit valve <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> are installed than those passing through the sidewall <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of the process chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing a gas supply portion used in a process chamber for manufacturing a semiconductor device in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> gas supply plate <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is located in a cover <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> of the process chamber. A gas supply line (not shown) for supplying gas is connected to the upper portion of the gas supply plate <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. A reaction gas, such as an etching gas, is supplied into the process chamber through holes <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> formed in the gas supply plate <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The energy of the etching gas supplied into the process chamber is increased by a high radio frequency (RF) power. High energy gas molecules collide with neighboring neutral molecules, generating electrons and ions. Due to repeated collisions, a plasma <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> is formed in the reaction chamber, and in particular, above the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the etching process, the level of uniformity with which the plasma <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> is distributed greatly affects the result of the process. That is, the distribution of the plasma <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> must be uniform in the space on the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. However, the plasma <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> can be drawn to the edge of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> due to the focus ring formed around the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, so that the plasma <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> may be concentrated near the edge of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. Thus, the structure of the holes <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> of the gas supply plate <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, which directly affects the distribution of plasma <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>, is changed such that the density of the plasma <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> is higher at the center than near the edge of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. In particular, the gas supply lines <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> which pass through the gas supply plate <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> are slanted such that gas discharge portions thereof point toward the center of the semiconductor wafer. Preferably, the slant angle &agr; of the gas discharge portion with respect to the vertical direction of the gas supply line <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> can be about 2-5&deg;. If the angle &agr; of the gas supply line <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> is too large, the plasma <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> is so dense at the center of the semiconductor substrate that the plasma <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> cannot distribute uniformly. Because the reaction gas is supplied toward the center of the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, the plasma density is locally increased at the center. However, since the focus ring draws the plasma, the distribution of plasma becomes uniform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The sidewall, gas supply plate, focus ring or edge ring of FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be made of, for example, quartz, silicon or aluminum nitride. That is, when a metal layer to be etched is formed of tungsten (W), SF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is used as an etching gas for removing the tungsten layer, and Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and BCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are used as etching gases for removing a barrier metal layer. In particular, SF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas leads to isotropic etching by a reaction with Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>which is used to form a conventional focus ring, and increases etching damage by F ions, resulting in Al, F and O byproducts. However, the generation of byproducts can be suppressed by using quartz, silicon or aluminum nitride. </paragraph>

Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> is seated on an electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> in a process chamber <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. The electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> is placed on a support stand <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. A semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> is guided by an annular focus ring <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> formed around the edge of the electrostatic chuck <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. The focus ring <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> also makes the density of plasma uniform across the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The focus ring <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> for these functions has an upper portion <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Preferably, the thickness d<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the upper portion <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> is approximately 2.4-3.0 mm. If the thickness d<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the upper portion <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> is more than 3 mm, a wafer transfer means, for example, a robotic arm (not shown), used to transfer the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, may contact the upper portion <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. If the thickness d<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>of the upper portion <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> is less than 2.4 mm, the original function of the upper portion <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> is deteriorated, thereby shortening the lifetime of the upper portion <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 through 19</cross-reference>, a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is seated on a wafer chuck <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, and a heater <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> is installed below the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. Also, an annular guide ring <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> is arranged around the edge of the upper surface of the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. The guide ring <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> is for preventing the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> from departing from its original position during the CVD process. For this, the guide ring <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> is separated by a predetermined distance, for example, about 0.1-1.0 mm, from the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. The guide ring <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> is separated by a distance of approximately 15-25 mm from the upper surface of the wafer chuck <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, which allows reaction gases to flow smoothly in the space.

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>A, because the reaction gas cannot flow smoothly between a semiconductor wafer and a wafer chuck in the conventional process chamber, a cleaning process has to be performed using a predetermined cleaning gas, such as ClF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, after processing 500 sheets of semiconductor wafers. Nevertheless, when the number of processed semiconductor wafers reaches about 1000 sheets, a large amount of particulates are generated as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> However, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>B, in the process chamber according to the present invention, a small number of particulates are generated after 1000 or more sheets of semiconductor wafers are processed.
