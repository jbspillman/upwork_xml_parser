<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to containers for tools and more particularly relates to an improved tool container housing and a method for its manufacture. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Tool boxes of various constructions are well known in the art. One problem with known tool box constructions is that they can cause trauma (e.g., black and blue marks) when carried due to impact with the user, for example when carried by a pivoting handle. Another problem with many tool boxes is that their use in the field does do not comply with Government guidelines (e.g., put out by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration). OSHA, for example, requires that a worker have both hands on a ladder as he or she climbs or descends the ladder, and this means that all tools must be carried on a belt or brought to a desired spot in another way (e.g., by a hoist). Existing tool boxes also present difficulties to workers who sometimes need to retrieve specific tools and workpieces (e.g., a pipe coupling or electrical socket) from their trucks with minimal fuss or delay. The shape of existing tool boxes, and the arrangement of their openings relative to the sides of such containers, can result in tools and workpieces being &ldquo;lost&rdquo; in the corners or difficult to locate. The present invention overcomes these deficiencies in an improved tool container construction and its method of manufacture. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes deficiencies in prior art tool container designs by providing a well engineered outer dimension which simultaneously provides better access to objects contained within the container and reduced trauma to the craftsman who has to carry it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention provides an improved tool container comprised of a substantially cylindrical body. The body has an axial length, opposing first and second ends, and defining an interior region therein in which tools, couplings, and assorted workpieces can be housed. The body includes at least one divider disposed between the first and second ends of the cylindrical body. Accesses are disposed along the cylindrical body on either side of the divider(s) and provide access to divided portions of the interior region of the tool container. End caps are disposed proximate to the first and second ends of the cylindrical body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a preferred arrangement, the end caps are recessed inwardly of the first and second ends so as to define a cavity which is sufficient in depth to permit the tool container to be grasped in someone&apos;s hands. Optionally, a grip can be positioned within or extend outside of the cavity to aid a person in grasping the tool container. Optionally, a handle can be affixed to each of said end caps as a specific form of a grip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The divider(s) preferably are sized so as to be substantially coextensive with a dimension of said interior region. When dividers are provided of this dimension, objects placed within the divided portions of the tool container will not intermix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred manufacturing method, in addition to the steps outlined above, an additional step of flattening a portion of the side wall is performed. The step of flattening a portion of the side wall preferably includes the steps of heating the side wall until it softens, and then pressing the softened side wall against a generally planar edge or surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In further, optional manufacturing steps, handles can be affixed to the end caps, a cover can be movably affixed to the tube to permit selective access to the accesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the invention, an arrangement of tool containers within a vehicle is disclosed. The arrangement includes a plurality of tool containers of the type described above in combination with a plurality of supports attached to the vehicle at a prescribed minimum spacing from one another. The tool containers are removably seated on the supports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These and other aspects, features and benefits of the present invention can be better understood with reference to the accompanying Drawings and Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> By way of overview and introduction, the present invention, the present invention is described in connection with a preferred embodiment in which the tool container is sized so that it may be carried in two hands or suspended from a craftsman&apos;s shoulder. The tool container of the present invention, however, can take on a variety of sizes to suit the type of workpiece(s) that it is to store. The container can house a number of workpieces to address a variety of contractor needs. By way of example only, the container can include a variety of pipe couplings such as straight and elbow connectors and assorted pieces of PVC and copper tubing. For other contractors, the container might contain electrical switches, outlets, telephone jacks, coaxial cable fittings, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> preferred embodiment of a tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has spaced and opposing first and second ends <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. An elongated body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> extends between the ends <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, as illustrated, the body <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is substantially cylindrical in shape. The substantially cylindrical shape of the body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> defines a corner-free exterior <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> between the ends <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which provides particular benefits when carried by the craftsman, as described more fully below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The cylindrical body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is hollow and defines an interior region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Accesses <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are formed in the cylindrical body to provide access to the interior region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and one or more covers <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are mounted for selective positioning over the accesses to thereby close the access. A closure mechanism <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> such as a hook and loop fastener, zipper, snap optionally is arranged to secure the cover <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in a closed position (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in the cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> divider <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is disposed between the ends <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the tool container. The accesses <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are shown positioned in either side of the divider <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, but the divider can be positioned in register with one of the accesses <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Multiple dividers <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can be included, although only one is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The divider defines distinct portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> within the interior region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and serves to define compartments within the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, if desired. The dividers can be permanently affixed within the interior region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, or can be selectively inserted or removed, as needed. Preferably, the dividers are shaped so as to define an obtuse angle &phgr; at the union of the divider <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the interior wall <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the cylindrical body. The obtuse angle &phgr; makes it easier for the craftsman to extract a small workpiece from the portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. A number of shapes can be used such as triangular and hourglass (as shown). The dividers can be sized so as to be generally coextensive with the diameter or size of the interior region <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the tool container when positioned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, to prevent objects placed within the portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> from intermixing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> also illustrates end caps <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> which are mounted proximate to the opposing first and second ends <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the body. The end caps <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> delimit one end of a defined portion of the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, the tool container illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> has the portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> defined by the end cap <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the divider <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> whereas the portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is defined by the divider <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the end cap <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Were further portions provided, they would be defined between plural dividers <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The end caps <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are preferably recessed inwardly of the first and second ends of the body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to thereby define respective cavities <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The cavities <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> can be sized so as to permit the tool container to be grasped by fingers of two hands of the craftsman. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an optional a grip <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> as having been mounted within the cavity. The grip can be a type of end cap, in which case there would be no need for the end caps <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the grip is molded element which is shaped to fit the natural grasp of the craftsman&apos;s hands. One suitable material for the grip is a hard rubber. The grip <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is seated, at least in part, within the cavities <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The grip can be provided with a radial projection <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> which extends radially outwardly beyond the diameter of the cylindrical body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to provide frictional engagement to the ground or another surface, and can be shaped so as to stem any tendency for the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to roll, e.g., by having one or more flat surfaces (including a flat surface generally opposite the accesses <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). The grip <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be affixed within the cavities <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, for example, by a friction fit, by an adhesive, by a heat weld. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> radial cross section illustrates a flattened portion <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> along the body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> according to the preferred embodiment. The flattened portion <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes an exterior flattened portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and an interior flattened portion <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, though a single flattened portion can be provided or formed in the body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, for example, a flattened exterior portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and a substantially cylindrical interior wall <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the flattened portion <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is generally opposite the accesses <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> so that the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can rest in a stable state on the ground or some other surface while the craftsman accesses the interior portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to get various workpieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an optional support <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> which provides a surface to prevent the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from rolling when placed on the ground, table, or other surface. The support <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> can be affixed to the body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> instead of imparting a flattened portion <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to the tool container. The support can be made of a variety of materials and can be attached in any number of ways. As with the flattened portion, the support <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is preferably disposed generally opposite the accesses <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also illustrates a handle <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> affixed to the end cap <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. A similar handle would be affixed to the end cap <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> if any handles are provided at all, so that the craftsman can pick up the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by the handles <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, instead of carrying the container by the edge of the interior wall <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With reference again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the tool container optionally includes an adjustable length strap <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which is coupled to the body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at two or more spaced locations <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> along its axial length. The strap can include a buckle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to permit a portion of the strap to be doubled over for strap shortening or to be slackened for strap lengthening. Alternatively or in addition, a reel mounted for rotational movement can be affixed to the body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or the end cap <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> (as shown) and coupled to one end of the strap <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Rotation of the reel causes the length of the strap to be adjusted (see arrow A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It can now be appreciated that the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment provides a generally cylindrical container with accesses to its interior through the cylindrical side wall. The container is carried by the craftsman with the cylindrical body positioned horizontally for good weight distribution, or at a slight angle (e.g, if carried upon one&apos;s shoulder using the strap <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). The particular arrangement of the accesses <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the carry mechanism (whether in the form of cavities <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, grips <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, handles <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, or a strap <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) cause the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to present only smooth, curved surfaces proximate to the craftsman&apos;s body. That is, the lower margin of the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, even if it has a flattened portion <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, does not define an exterior corner. As a result, if the body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> container bumps into the craftsman while being carried, the point of impact between the craftsman and the exterior <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is blunt due to the curved surfaces, and is less likely to cause trauma. In addition, the adjustable strap <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be used to adjust where the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> rests relative to the craftsman&apos;s body and thereby shift the point of contact; however, it is the shape of the exterior wall <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which provides the greatest advantage over prior art designs in ameliorating injury from use. In contrast, the hard shells of conventional tool containers are generally characterized as having a pivoting carry handle which permits a bottom corner to swing and bump into the craftsman. When filled, such a heavy container can cause substantial trauma upon impact, especially after repeated impact in the same location (e.g., when carried all day in the same hand). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, several tool containers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are shown compactly arranged along a wall <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of a truck, van or the like for ready access to its contents. A number of supports <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> are mounted to the wall <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> in any conventional manner, such as by nuts and bolts <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. The supports <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> include a brace <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> which is seated against the wall <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, a ledge <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> which extends away from the wall, preferably generally horizontally, and a lip <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> which extends upwardly. Together, the ledge and lip define a pocket <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> which cradles the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> when seated on the ledge <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>. The lip <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is preferably sized so as to minimize any chance that the tool container could dislodge during transit of the truck, van, or other vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The supports are mounted on the wall <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> and spaced from one another so as to permit ready insertion and removal of the tool container into the pocket <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. In other words, if the tool container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a diameter &ldquo;D,&rdquo; then the distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; between the lip <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and the underside of the ledge <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> is greater than diameter &ldquo;D.&rdquo; A number of the supports can be mounted to the wall <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> by way of a pre-drilled bracket <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, or can be provided mounted to the bracket <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> for affixing to the wall <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The bracket <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> ensures proper spacing between adjacent supports <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> in order to most compactly arrange the tool containers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> within a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In use, the craftsman can remove one or more tool containers from his or her vehicle at a job site and have a selection of parts or tools available for a given type of job, for example. Alternatively, the craftsman can access interior portions <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the tool container while the tool container remains cradled in the support <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> by rotating a given tool container in the direction of arrow B, for example, by grabbing the edge of one or two of the accesses <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, or by pulling on a cord <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. The cord <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>, if provided, is anchored to the body <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in any conventional manner (e.g. is knotted within a throughhole). Preferably, the tool container has a curved interior wall <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which permits the contents of the tool container to shift smoothly as the container is rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the process steps in a manufacturing method for fabricating a tool container of the type described above. At step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, a substantially cylindrical tube <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is provided of the type having a side wall and first and second ends. The tube <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is preferably made of PVC or another, hard plastic material. A portion of the side wall can be flattened, as indicated at step <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. The step of flattening the side wall preferably includes the steps of heating the side wall of the tube until it softens, and then pressing said softened side wall against a flat surface or edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, a plurality of accesses are formed in the side wall of the tube, for example, by cutting through the side wall. The side wall can be cut in any conventional manner using a tool suitable for cutting through the material of the tube. One or more dividers are affixed between the accesses, either permanently or so that they can be removed by the craftsman, if that is desired, as indicated at step <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. The dividers can be seated in slots or between ridges formed in or on the interior wall <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, with the dividers being snapped in place by a mild rotation into a radial orientation relative to the axis of the tube <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>, the first and second ends of the tube are capped with end caps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Optionally, a carry mechanism such as the strap <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, grip <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, or handle <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> can be affixed to the end caps, as indicated at step <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight>. The carry mechanism can be affixed to the end caps, or proximate the end caps near the first and second ends of the tube <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Also, a cover can be affixed to the tool container in a manner that permits it to be selectively positioned so as to block or permit access to the accesses. The manufacturing method ends at step <highlight><bold>780</bold></highlight>, though additional steps can be preformed to provide one or more of the features described above in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described with respect to a particularly preferred embodiment, the invention is susceptible to implementation in other ways which are within the spirit of the invention which is defined in terms of the recitations of the appended claims and equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
