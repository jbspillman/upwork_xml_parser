<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a terminal device, an accounting system and a data processing method, and particular to an accounting system including an accounting center in an information distribution system and a terminal device that can communicate with the accounting center. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There are various types of audio-visual equipments owned by users and it has been common that users enjoy music and video software for personal use. For example, some users own an audio system using recording media such as compact discs (CD) or mini discs (MD, trademark) and purchase desired CD or MD for playback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Apart from the system for providing music or the like as a so-called package medium to the user, a system for distributing data such as music to the terminal device of the user through communication is considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is also considered to distribute not music data itself but additional data for the music owned by the user on CD or the like, for example, text data of title, lyrics, message and profile of artist, and related graphic data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In consideration of a system where information distribution of music and additional information is chargeable, an accounting system capable of collecting appropriate fee from the user is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As the accounting system, there is first considered a system for carrying out accounting through communication between the terminal device and the accounting center every time chargeable information is taken into the terminal device owned by the user. In such a system, for example, in the state where the terminal device and the accounting center are connected with each other via a telephone line or the like, the accounting center carries out accounting with respect to the user in accordance with the information taken into the user terminal device and later draws the fee from the bank account of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, as the communication between the accounting center and the terminal device is carried out every time information is taken into the user terminal device as described above, the user must wait for the use of information until the accounting processing is completed. Particularly, depending on the degree of congestion and type of line, the user may have to wait for a very long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is also considered to employ a prepaid card as the accounting system. However, there are many disadvantages for introduction of the system such as the high cost of circulation of the prepaid cards, the troublesome procedure for the user to purchase the card, and the necessity of providing a dedicated card reader in the terminal device of the user. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is an object of the present invention to overcome the foregoing problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is provided a terminal device including: a first memory for storing accounting point information; a second memory for storing information distributed from an external source; and a control section for updating the accounting point information stored in the first memory and updating attributes of the distributed information when the distributed information is stored in the second memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is also provided an accounting system including: a terminal device including a first memory for storing accounting point information, a second memory for storing information distributed from an external source, and a control section for updating the accounting point information stored in the first memory and updating attributes of the distributed information when the distributed information is stored in the second memory; and an accounting center including an accounting section for carrying out accounting processing in accordance with the accounting point information transmitted from the terminal device.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The terminal device, the accounting system and the data processing method according to the present invention will not be described in detail with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic view showing the overview of an information distribution system to which the present invention is applied. This information distribution system is basically constituted by a recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> used by a general user at home <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the like, and an information distribution/accounting center such as a distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as an information service institution which provides information to be used in the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> communicate various information with each other via a communication channel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The communication channel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is made of a public line network such as an ISDN line, or a dedicated line network constructed exclusively for that system. The line mode is not particularly limited. Also, the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may communicate information with each other via a satellite communication channel made up of a communication satellite <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a parabolic antenna <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> installed at each home <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> used by the general user has a large-capacity data file storage section provided therein, and has the function to drive a so-called package medium such as an optical disc, a magneto-optical disc or a semiconductor memory, the function to input data from another equipment, and the function to input data through the communication channel. In addition, the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stores various data including audio data and video data reproduced from media purchased by the user such as an optical disc, an optical disc device and a semiconductor memory, or various data inputted from another equipment or the communication channel, to the data file storage section as respective files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> For example, music files such that each tune is stored as one file in the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are arbitrarily reproduced by the user. Therefore, if the user having a number of optical discs stores in advance each of the tunes of all the optical discs as each file into the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the user can reproduce a desired tune without selecting and loading an optical disc to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> provides various kinds of chargeable or free information to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, as the information related to the music files or the like stored in the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, text data such as the title of the tune, the name of artist and lyrics, image data such as a tune image and an image of the artist, the address of the Internet home page (URL: Uniform Resource Locator) of the artist, copyright-related information, and the names of parties concerned (lyrics writer, composer, producer, etc.) Are provided. The recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stores such information provided from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> correspondingly to the tunes and uses the information for various operations such as display onto a display section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the audio data itself, that is, tunes, to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stores the received audio data as files. That is, a sales system for tunes which is different from that for package media like optical discs is constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> carries out processing for charging the fee to the user with respect to the chargeable information provided to the user. For example, the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> carries out processing for drawing the amount equivalent to the fee of the information provided to the user, from the bank account of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The chargeable information may include related information for tunes as described above and data of the tune itself. What information is the actually chargeable information provided by the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is determined by the institution, company or individual person who provides information sales service. It is not a technical element constituting this invention and therefore will not be described further in detail. Meanwhile, a mode for providing a certain chargeable operation function to the recording/reproduction device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as well as providing information may also be considered. In such a mode, for example, the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> charges the copyright royalty to the user when the user dubs music data of an optical disc to a magneto-optical disc or a semiconductor memory by using the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The essential technique of this specific example consists in the accounting processing. The accounting target is the offer of certain chargeable information. However, if permission of dubbing is chargeable, the dubbing permission information is the offer of chargeable information of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As a device used by the user, a portable recording/reproducing device which can be connected to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, that is, a portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, may be employed. The portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a data file storage section provided therein for storing files of audio data and the like. When the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is connected to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the files stored in the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, for example, tunes are duplicated or shifted to the data file storage section in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, it is also possible to carry out control so that the files stored in the data file storage section in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are duplicated or shifted to the data file storage section in the recording/reproducing section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> By shifting or duplicating a desired file of the files stored in the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the user can use the file on the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, the user can shift to the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> the files of tunes to which he/she wants to listen on that day and listen to the tunes by using the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> outdoors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the information distribution system, there may be a number of servers which distribute information, for example, an information distribution center <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This information distribution center <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is similar to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in that various kinds of chargeable or free information to the user, but it does not carry out accounting processing with respect to the user. Specifically, the accounting processing with respect to the user is entirely managed by the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the distribution center <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> charges to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the fee for the offer of information to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As information providing means to the user, a down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> arranged at a train station or at a shop may be considered. In the down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a loading section MT is formed in which the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be loaded. The loading section MT is similar to a loading section MT of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which will be described later. The user can load his/her portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the loading section MT of the down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and obtain or purchase desired information in the form of a so-called vending machine. The down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is managed by the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the distribution center <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> sequentially receives necessary information from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the distribution center <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and transfers the received information to the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> thus sells various kinds of information to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the appearance of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In this description, only an example is employed and therefore various other types can be employed for the appearance of each equipment, the user interface structure, that is, the structure for operation and display, and the mode of connection between the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a so-called radio cassette-type equipment suitable for the use at the user&apos;s home. The recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also be of a component type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, operation keys and operation knobs for the user to carry out various operations, and various rotary/press keys which are rotated to change the menu and pressed to decide the menu are provided as operators Ka on the front panel of the equipment.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As internal storage means of the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a hard disk driver (HDD) <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for carrying out recording/reproduction of information to/from a hard disk is provided. For example, audio information transferred from the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via an interface (I/F) driver <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is stored onto the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the file basis, for example, one tune as one file. A solid state memory such as a flash memory may be used as the storage means in place of the HDD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, similarly to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> for compressing audio data in accordance with the ATRAC2 system and a decoder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for decoding audio data compressed in accordance with the ATRAC2 system are provided. The encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the decoder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> carry out encoding and decoding of the audio data supplied thereto, respectively, under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. In the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a buffer memory <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is provided for temporarily storing audio data as a processing target. The buffer memory <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> carries out data writing/reading under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case where audio data which is not encoded in accordance with the ATRAC2 system is supplied from the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the interface driver <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, the audio data is temporarily stored in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the audio data is supplied to and encoded by the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in accordance with the ATRAC2 system, as preprocessing for recording the audio data onto the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the encoded data is temporarily stored again in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the encoded audio information is ultimately stored onto the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In this example, audio files encoded in accordance with the ATRAC2 system are stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the case where the audio file stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is supplied via the interface driver <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and stored onto the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, that is, in the case where the data file of a tune is duplicated or shifted from the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the processing by the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is not necessary. Meanwhile, the audio data read out from the optical disc loaded on the CD-ROM drive <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, that is, non-compressed audio data, may be inputted as it is via the interface driver <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. In such case, encoding by the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is carried out as described above as the processing for recording the audio data onto the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In this example, the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is constituted so that the audio data encoded in accordance with the ATRAC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> system by the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is stored onto the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. However, the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may also be constituted so that non-compressed audio data is stored as it is onto the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, as the means for supplying the audio data to the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> for compression, a microphone terminal tb<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a line input terminal tb<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and an optical digital terminal tb<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are provided as well as the above-described interface driver <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The terminals tb<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to tb<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> correspond to the respective ones of the terminals tb shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is constituted so that an audio signal inputted through an amplifier <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> from the microphone terminal tb<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> connected with a microphone or an audio signal inputted from the line input terminal tb<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected with another equipment such as a CD player is inputted through an A/D converter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Such input audio data, too, is encoded by the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is constituted so that data inputted from an external equipment (e.g., CD player) connected to the optical digital terminal tb<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is inputted to the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> via an IEC958 encoder <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The data thus digitally inputted is also encoded by the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, after the data inputted from the external equipment as described above is encoded by the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the encoded data can be stored onto the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the file basis. The encode algorithm of the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is not limited to ATRAC2 and may be another encode algorithm for compressing information such as ATRAC, MPEG, PASC, Twin VQ, Real Audio, or Liquid Audio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The audio information stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is decoded by the decoder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a playback sound is outputted from the speaker <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> via a D/A converter <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and an amplifier <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a playback sound is outputted from headphones by connecting headphones to the headphone terminal tb<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Although the decoder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> carries out decoding in accordance with the ATRAC2 system in this example, any decode algorithm may be employed as long as it corresponds to the encode algorithm of the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Also, software processing by the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be employed, instead of constituting the encoder <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the decoder <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as hardware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the display section <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is provided, as also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, as an interface for the user to manage and control files of audio data and the like stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The display section <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is driven by a display driver <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In the display section <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, required characters, symbols and icons are displayed under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In the display section <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, a folder corresponding to an audio file or a jacket image is displayed, and the operation thereof is made possible by a pointing device corresponding to the panel operating section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such as a touch by a mouse, a pen or the user&apos;s finger. For example, the operation to reproduce from the speaker <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> an audio file indicated by the user on the display section <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is carried out under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Also, the touch panel function of the display section <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> enables erasure of an audio file selected by the user on the touch panel and duplication or shift to an external equipment such as the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, data transmission/reception between the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made possible by loading the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the loading section MT of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may have a non-contact interface such as IrDA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Although not shown, a charging current supply section is provided in the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The charging current supply section may supply a charging current to the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> loaded therein so as to charge a charge-type battery, which is the operation power source of the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a specific example of the file storage mode in the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> For example, the user loads his/her CD onto the CD-ROM drive <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and records, that is, duplicates each recorded music tune as a file onto the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the user can send a request to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then receive information of a music album in response to the request, and record each music tune of the music album as each file onto the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As the data is thus stored on the album basis like CD, a management file is formed for each album and each music tune is stored as one audio file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the state where n music albums are recorded on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Management files AL (AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to AL(n)) corresponding to the respective albums are formed. Music tunes recorded on each album are stores as audio files, while corresponding to the management file AL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, files shown in one row express files constituting one album. Dubbing data from a certain CD, that is, respective tunes, are stored as audio files AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . corresponding to the management file AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Data from another album, that is, respective tunes, are stores as audio files AL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, AL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, AL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . corresponding to the management file AL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. That is, AL(n)-M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, AL(n)-M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, AL(n)M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . are the actual music data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In this manner, in recording one album to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, audio files corresponding to the number of recorded tunes are formed together with one management file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In recording a certain music album to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the user inputs data or receives chargeable or free related information with respect to the album from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby storing such information as a related information file. For example, a related information file AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ad </italic></highlight>is formed corresponding to the management file AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Data stored as the related information file AL(*)ad includes text data such as the title of tunes, the name of the artist, lyrics and messages, image data such as a tune image and an image of the artist, the home page address (URL) of the artist, copyright-related information, names of parties concerned (lyrics writer, composer, producer) and the like, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The management file AL(*) includes various kinds of management information related to the corresponding one or plural audio files and related information files, and is used for reproduction, shift, duplication and editing of each audio file and related information file. For example, the management file AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> contains management information for the whole group of files constituting a certain album, management information related to the respective audio files AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, . . . , and management information related to the related information file AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ad. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a specific example of management information recorded in the management file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Album information, which is the management information for the whole album, includes, for example, the type and number of files, album title, data size, date and time information of recording, names of parties concerned (album producer, lyrics writer, composer, performer, etc.), copyright information, album ID, information use permission flag, and various other management information. Tile information use permission flag is a flag for preventing the use of information in the state where appropriate accounting is not made with respect to the chargeable information. This function will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the management file AL(*), file information (&num;1) to file information (&num;m) are also recorded as management information corresponding to individual audio files. The file information includes, for example, the type of the corresponding file, address pointer indicating the recording position of the corresponding file on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, data size of the file, title (title of tune, etc.), date and time information of recording, names of parties concerned (lyrics writer, composer, performer, etc.), copyright information, information use permission flag, and various other management information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the management file AL(*), related file information is recorded as management information for managing the corresponding related information file. The related file information includes, for example, the type and number of corresponding related information files, address pointer indicating the recording position of the corresponding related information file on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, data size of the related information file, date and time information of recording, names of parties concerned, copyright information, information use permission flag, and various other management information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As such management information is recorded in the management file (*), the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is enabled to carry out various processing such as reproduction, shift, duplication, and editing of a specified tune. Under the control of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also enabled to output images and texts as related information along the operation of reproduction of the tune. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The file storage mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and the contents of the management information shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> are only examples. In reality, any file storage mode and management mode suitable for various processing of audio data files, which are real data to be stored, may be employed. The audio data files need not be managed on the album basis and can be managed as a group of tunes preferred by the user or as a group of each genre in accordance with the instruction from the user. Not only audio files of tunes but also dynamic image data, still image data, text data, and programs as game software may be stored as real files, that is, as related information files but as independent files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, too, a file storage mode similar to that of HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The accounting processing according to the present invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As described above, the user can purchase information by, for example, storing chargeable information distributed from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the distribution center <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> onto the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The user also can purchase information by loading the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into the download device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and recording arbitrary information onto the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The chargeable information recorded on the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be shifted to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and made available there, or can be used or reproduced as it is stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The chargeable information stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> cannot be used when appropriate accounting is not carried out. For example, with respect to the chargeable information, the information use permission flag shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is set to the off-state, that is, the use prohibition state in recording to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The appropriate accounting by the user switches the information use permission flag to the on-state, that is, the use permission state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> confirms the information use permission flag of the file stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and controls the execution of the reproducing operation or the like, thus setting the use prohibition state, that is, prohibiting the use by the user of the file for which accounting is not carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The accounting processing for making the file available is the processing of points stored in the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and is not the accounting processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Specifically, when the point processing is carried out in the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the file as the chargeable information inputted to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and recorded on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is made available to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In the following example of the accounting processing, the number of points PT and point use records R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> are stored into the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In this example, the number of points PT is set at a fixed value, for example, 100 points, as an initial value. Every time the chargeable information is inputted to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and recorded onto the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> subtracts the number of points equivalent to the fee of the information contents from the stored number of points PT and thus updates the number of points PT. This processing is the accounting processing in the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The point use records R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . are added in accordance with the consumption of the number of points PT, that is, the input of the chargeable information. The contents of this data include the date and time of input of chargeable data, name of data, number of subtraction points, and payee (name of seller, name of copyright holder, etc.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the accounting processing in the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is executed by subtracting the number of points PT in accordance with the input of chargeable information. The CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> thus regards that the user paid the fee and permits the use of the chargeable information. That is, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sets the above-described information use permission flag in the on-state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the actual accounting, for example, the processing for drawing the fee from the bank account of the user is carried out at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through communication between the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is carried out periodically or when the number of points PT is insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The operation of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for realizing such accounting processing will be described with reference to the flowcharts of FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> At steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> monitors whether chargeable information is constantly inputted or whether the periodical accounting date and time have been reached, with respect to the accounting processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> When the chargeable information is provided from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in response to a request for purchase of information by the user, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> advances from step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so as to carry out operation control for recording the input information to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sets the information use permission flag in the off-state, that is, the use prohibition state, with respect to the file stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> discriminates whether or not the number of points equivalent to the fee for the information now inputted is left as the number of points PT in the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> If the number of points PT is left, the CPU <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> subtracts the number of points PT and additionally stores a point use record R(x) with respect to this information purchase to the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> finds and updates the number of points PT in accordance with the following equation. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Number of points PT&equals;(number of points PT)&minus;(number of points equivalent to fee for information of this time) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> stores the current date and time, name of purchase data, number of subtraction points (&equals;number of points equivalent to fee for information of this time) and payee as one point use record R(x) to the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The information such as the name of purchase data and payee is simultaneously transmitted from the information provider such as the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Such information may be unnecessary depending on the accounting mode, that is, the contract mode of the right holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> After updating the contents of the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> regards that the fee for the information now stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has been paid, and sets the information use permission flag in the on-state, that is, the use permission state, with respect to the information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> For the user, the information is made available when the temporary accounting, that is, the point subtraction, is carried out with respect to the distributed information. It means that the user can immediately use the information on receiving the distribution of the information, without any latency time for communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for accounting processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The actual accounting processing, for example, the precessing for drawing the fee from the back account of the user is carried out periodically and automatically. Specifically, every predetermined accounting date and time, the processing of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> advances from step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The accounting date and time are preset to a specified time point of each predetermined period, for example, every day or every week, in the processing program of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Since the accounting processing requires communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it is convenient to set the specified time point during a time period such as midnight in which the user is normally unlikely to use the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is possible that the user can set the specified date and time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> discriminates whether or not the number of points PT of the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is updated after the previous accounting time point, that is, after the previous accounting processing by the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> discriminates whether or not the user purchased information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In this example, every time the accounting processing by the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is carried out, the number of points of the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is restored to the initial value and the point use records R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . are cleared. Therefore, if purchase of information is not carried out, the number of points PT of the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is at the initial value and no point use record is stored. In such initial state, the actual accounting processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> need not be carried out this time and therefore the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> returns from step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the loop of steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> If the number of points PT of the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is not at the initial value and one or more point use records are stored, it means that the user purchased information. Therefore, the processing goes to step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the accounting processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Specifically, at step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> connects the communication channel to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and makes an accounting request. Then, at step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> waits until an OK notification is received from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the channel connection and accounting request at step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the processing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is carried out at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The distribution/accounting processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is executed by a controller or the like of the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, though not shown. Specifically, when an accounting request is sent from a certain recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the controller of the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> advances from step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to carry out preparation processing for accounting. For example, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> transmits necessary information such as the user ID, equipment ID and password number set by the user together with the accounting request, and the controller of the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> carries out authentication processing based on the transmitted information as the preparation processing of step S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. That is, the controller discriminates whether or not the accounting request is an appropriate accounting request from an appropriate user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> On completion of the authentication and other preparation processing, the controller at step S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> sends an OK notification to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the controller waits for transmission from the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Although not shown, the processing ends with an error if inconvenience such as an authentication error occurs at step S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> When the OK notification is sent from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> advances from step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and transmits the number of points PT and the point use record stored in the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> at that time to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> waits for an OK notification or NG notification from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> On the side of the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, when the number of points PT and the point use record are transmitted from the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the controller advances from step S<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and takes the received data. At step S<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the controller carries out accounting processing based on the received number of points PT and point use record. Specifically, since the difference between the initial number of points and the transmitted current number of points is the number of points equivalent to the amount of information purchase by the user, the controller discriminates the number of purchase points and prepares data for drawing from the bank account of the user. The controller also discriminates the right holder who is to receive the fee for the offer of information, from the point user record, and prepares data for distribution of the fee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> When such accounting processing normally ends, the processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the controller sends an OK notification to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, if an accounting error occurs for a certain reason, the processing proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the controller sends an NG notification to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the controller disconnects the line with the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> When an OK notification is sent from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> determines that the accounting processing by the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> ends properly, and proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to initialize the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. That is, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> restores the number of points PT to the initial value and clears the point use record. Thus, the periodical accounting precessing ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> If an NG notification is sent from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> carries out the processing from step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> again. If an accounting error occurs at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is to carry out such retrial. Therefore, the processing from step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be executed with the line kept connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, in the above-described processing of steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the temporary accounting processing in the form of point subtraction is carried out at the time of input of chargeable information. In the case where a large volume of information is continuously purchased, there may be the case where the number of points is insufficient at step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In such case, the processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in this example. Specifically, in the case of insufficient points, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provisionally requests accounting processing to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to carry out processing to restore the number of points to the initial value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> connects the communication channel to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and makes a request for accounting processing. At step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> waits for an OK notification from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the above-described periodical accounting processing, the processing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is carried out at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with such channel connection and request for accounting. On completion of the preparation processing such as authentication, an OK notification is sent to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. If any inconvenience such as an authentication error occurs, the processing ends with an error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> When an OK notification is sent from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and transmits the number of points PT and the point use record stored in the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> at that time to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. &ldquo;Number of necessary points of this time&rdquo; and &ldquo;accounting information for chargeable information of this time&rdquo; described in parentheses at step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are information to be transmitted in another processing, which will be described later. At steps S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> waits for an OK notification or NG notification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> When the number of points PT and the point use record are transmitted from the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the controller of the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to steps S<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 111</cross-reference> and carries out accounting processing based on the number of points PT and the point use record, similarly to the above-described above. As the accounting processing normally ends, the controller proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and sends an OK notification to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If an accounting error occurs for a certain reason, the controller proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and sends an NG notification to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the controller disconnects the line with the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> When an OK notification is sent from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> determines that the accounting processing has properly ended, and proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> so as to initialize the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> restores the number of points PT to the initial value and clears the point use record. Meanwhile, when an NG notification is sent from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> carries out the processing from step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> As the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is initialized at step S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, that is, as the number of points PT is set at the initial value, the number of points equivalent to the fee for the information that is inputted this time is secured. Thus, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> to subtract the number of points PT in accordance with the information purchase of this time and to additionally store the point use record R(x) with respect to the information purchase of this time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> After thus updating the contents of the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> regards that the fee has been paid with respect to the information stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> this time, and sets the information use permission flag in the on-state, that is, the use permission state, with respect to that information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the above-described processing, even in the case where the number of points is insufficient as the user purchases a large volume of information at a time, the number of points is restored to the initial value through the provisional accounting processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, the temporary accounting processing by means of subtraction of the number of points is made possible. Therefore, the user can use the information without waiting for the periodically executed accounting processing after step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> As another example of the processing of step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the number of necessary points of this time and the accounting information of chargeable information of this time may also be transmitted to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as well as the current number of points PT and point use record. In this case, the accounting processing of step S<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes the processing of the fee for the information input of this time as well as the processing with the number of points PT and point use record, that is, the settlement processing with respect to the information purchase up to immediately before the information input of this time. In such case, since the fee for insufficiency of this time is settled, the processing of step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is not necessary and the processing may proceed from step S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> to step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, as indicated by a broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In the case where the user purchased information by recording chargeable information onto the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the accounting processing is carried out as described above. However, the user can also purchase the chargeable information by setting the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into the download device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as described above. In this case, the down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> down-loads the information designated by the user to the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> but sets the down-loaded file in the use prohibition state at that time. That is, the information use permission flag is set in the off-state with respect to the file on the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In order to use the file down-loaded in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the user must connect the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to shift the file to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and carry out the point processing, or must carry out point processing by using the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In the case where the file down-loaded in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is shifted to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to be used, the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> regards the file shift as the input of chargeable information in the processing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and carries out the processing of step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the subsequent steps as described above. Specifically, the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> carries out the temporary accounting processing through the point processing and sets the file shifted to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into the use permission state. After that, the user can freely use the file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the file down-loaded to the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can also be made available in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by carrying out only the point processing at the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, without shifting the file to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The processing operation therefor of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described with reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> monitors the connection with the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When the connection with the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is detected, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> advances to step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and confirms the file stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> discriminates whether or not there is any file in the use prohibition state at that time. The case where there is a file in the use prohibition state is the case where there is a file of chargeable information which is down-loaded from the down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by using the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and for which the accounting processing has not been carried out yet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Thus, at step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> confirms the number of points of the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and discriminates whether or not the number of points equivalent to the fee for the file in the use prohibition state is left as the number of points PT. If the number of points PT is left, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> subtracts the number of points PT and additionally stores the point use record R(x). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> regards that the fee has been paid for the file in the use prohibition state stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and sets the information use permission flag in the on-state, that is, the use permission state. Specifically, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sets the information use permission flag in the on-state by directly accessing the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or through the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user can use the chargeable information down-loaded to the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> If the number of points is insufficient at step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> carries out the processing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> similarly to the case of step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As the processing of FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is thus carried out, the user need not carry out the operation for the accounting processing with respect to the purchase of the chargeable information and therefore needs to carry out little troublesome operation. For example, the processing with a prepaid card or the like is not necessary. Also, a card reader and other equipments and operators necessary for the accounting processing are not required, thus enabling simplification of the structure of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Moreover, since the actual accounting processing using the communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is carried out periodically and automatically, the user will not experience any trouble in this regard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Since the accounting processing through the communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not carried out every time the information is inputted, the user need not wait for the accounting processing and can immediately use the obtained information. In the case where the number of points is insufficient, the accounting processing and initialization of the number of points through the communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are provisionally carried out. Therefore, even in the case where the number of points is insufficient, it is possible to avoid such a situation that the user cannot use the obtained information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In addition, information can be purchased by using the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the accounting can be carried out by the point processing using the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Therefore, diversification of the means for obtaining information can be realized and the accounting processing can be smoothly carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> While various modifications of the processing can be considered, specific examples as modifications will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In the above-described example, the number of points PT in the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is initially set at the specified initial value, and the number of points PT is restored to the initial value at steps S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. However, the initial value may be not only a fixed value but also may be set by the user. For example, for a user who wants to purchase a large volume of information, it is preferred to set a large number of points as an initial value so as to best avoid the insufficiency of points at steps S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. That is, in the case of the insufficient of points, the user must wait for the communication and accounting processing time to carry out the provisional accounting processing through communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and some users want to avoid such a situation as much as possible. Therefore, if the initial value of the number of points can be selected by the user, the accounting processing preferred by each user can be realized. In the case where the initial value can be thus changed, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> needs to transmit the current number of points and the initial value in carrying out the accounting processing through communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> determines the number of points to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Regardless of whether the initial value is fixed or can be changed, the current number of points and the number of points to be used may be stored in the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> so as to transmit the number of point to be used to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> In the above-described example, the point use record is stored in the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. However, it is also possible not to store the point use record. For example, if the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> simply collects from the user the fee corresponding to the information purchase, the accounting amount can be determined only from the point value and therefore the point use record is not necessary. That is, in the case where the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> need not carry out distribution of the fee to another organization or the right holder, or in the case where the fee is uniformly and fairly distributed to the copyright holder and the like, the processing corresponding to the point use record, that is, the processing for discriminating the information purchased by the user, is not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Since the point use record has the meaning of information purchase record to the user, the point use record may be so constituted that it is not cleared on completion of the accounting processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the entire point record information may be cumulatively stored on the HDD or the like. In this manner, the user can confirm the past information purchase state by causing the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to display the record in a list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In the above-described example, when the points become insufficient, the accounting processing through communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provisionally carried out. However, it is also possible to save the file in the use prohibition state when the points are insufficient, without carrying out such provisional processing. Specifically, when the number of points is initialized after the subsequent periodical processing (steps S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>), the number of points is subtracted to make the file available. Alternatively, when the points are insufficient, it may be considered to delete the stored file or to confirm the number of points before the storage to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and prohibit the recording operation if the points are insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In the above-described example, in order to carry out the accounting processing through periodical or provisional communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it is assumed that the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is physically connected to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the communication channel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For example, in the state where the user has detached the connection cord of the communication channel <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for a certain reason, the accounting processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> cannot be executed. Since the accounting processing through communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has the meaning of settlement with respect to the provisional accounting through the point processing, the inability to communicate means that appropriate accounting cannot be carried out. It may also lead to unauthorized use such that the connection cord is detached to prevent communication, that is, to prevent settlement after information for some points are obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Thus, in order to prevent such a situation that the accounting processing cannot be carried out because of the carelessness of the user or to prevent the intentional unauthorized use, it is appropriate to warn the user of the inability to communicate and request connection in the case where the connection cord is detached when the accounting date and time are reached at step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In addition, in order to make the connection compulsory to a certain extent, it may be considered to make unavailable all the files in the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or the files for which settlement has not been carried out or to cause the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to stop the entire operating functions until the connection is restored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In the above-described example, the provisional accounting is carried out by the point subtraction method. However, it may also be considered to carry out the provisional accounting by a point addition method, then periodically communicate with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to execute the accounting processing corresponding to the number of points at that time point, and restore the number of points to zero on completion of the accounting processing. The point subtraction method as in the above-described example has such an effect that excessive information purchase by the user can be restrained, that is, the user can be aware of the insufficiency of points when it occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Another specific example of the accounting processing will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> In the above-described example (first accounting processing), the provisional accounting is carried out through the point processing at the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the actual accounting processing is carried out by periodically communicating with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to carry out settlement corresponding to the quantity of point consumption. On the other hand, in this example (second accounting processing), the actual accounting processing is carried out simply when the user purchases the number of points from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and after that, the user can obtain information as long as the number of points is left. That is, advance accounting as in the prepaid card is realized by the point processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In this case, it suffices that the number of points PT shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is stored in the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The point use records R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . maybe stored. These records are not used for accounting but enable the user to confirm the information purchase record. The accounting processing in the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is carried out by subtracting the number of points corresponding to the input of chargeable information, similarly to the first accounting processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The operation of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for realizing such second accounting processing will be described with reference to the flowcharts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference> and the processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> At steps S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> monitors whether chargeable information is constantly inputted or whether the point purchase operation by the user has been carried out, with respect to the accounting processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> When the chargeable information is provided from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in response to a request for purchase of information by the user, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> advances from step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> so as to carry out operation control for recording the input information to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sets the information use permission flag in the off-state, that is, the use prohibition state, with respect to the file stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> discriminates whether or not the number of points equivalent to the fee for the information now inputted is left as the number of points PT in the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> If the number of points PT is left, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> subtracts the number of points PT. Specifically, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> finds and updates the number of points in accordance with the following equation. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Number of points PT&equals;(number of points PT)&minus;(number of points equivalent to fee for information of this time) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> After updating the number of points PT of the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> regards that the fee for the information now stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has been paid, and sets the information use permission flag in the on-state, that is, the use permission state, with respect to the information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> For the user, the information is made available when the temporary accounting, that is, the point subtraction, is carried out with respect to the distributed information. It means that the user can immediately use the information on receiving the distribution of the information, without any latency time for communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for accounting processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if it is determined at step S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> that the number of points is insufficient, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> ends the processing at that time. That is, the information stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> remains unavailable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> As described above, the user can carry out the operation to purchase the number of points, if necessary, at an arbitrary time point. As the purchase operation by the user is carried out, the processing of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> advances from step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and an operation image for point purchase as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is first displayed in the display section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The user selects the quality of point purchase from this screen and carries out decision operation. For example, the user carries out operation by touching the screen. When the user carries out cancel operation, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> stops the point purchase processing at step S<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> When the user selects the quantity of point purchase from the screen of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and carries out the decision operation, the processing of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to connect the communication channel to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and send a point purchase request. At step S<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> waits for reception of an OK notification from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the channel connection and point purchase request at step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, the processing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is carried out at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The distribution/accounting processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is carries out by the controller and the like of the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, similarly to the first accounting processing. Specifically, when a point purchase request is sent from a certain recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the controller of the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> advances from step S<highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to carry out preparation processing for point sales. For example, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> transmits necessary information such as the user ID, equipment ID and password number set by the user together with the point purchase request, and the controller of the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> carries out authentication processing based on the transmitted information as the preparation processing of step S<highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. That is, the controller discriminates whether or not the point purchase request is an appropriate point purchase request from an appropriate user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> On completion of the authentication and other preparation processing, the controller at step S<highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> sends an OK notification to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the controller waits for transmission from the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Although not shown, the processing ends with an error if inconvenience such as an authentication error occurs at step S<highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> When the OK notification is sent from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> advances from step S<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and transmits the quantity of point purchase selected by the user to the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> waits for an OK notification or NG notification from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> On the side of the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, when the quantity of point purchase is transmitted from the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the controller advances from step S<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> and takes the received data. At step S<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the controller carries out accounting processing based on the quantity of point purchase received from the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the controller prepares data for drawing from the bank account of the user in accordance with the quantity of point purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> When such accounting processing normally ends, the processing at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> to step S <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the controller sends an OK notification to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, if an accounting error occurs for a certain reason, the processing proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and the controller sends an NG notification to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the controller disconnects the line with the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> When an OK notification is sent from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> determines that the accounting processing for point sales by the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> ends properly, and proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to add the number of purchased points, that is, the quantity of points selected by the user for purchase, to the number of points PT at that time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> If an NG notification is sent from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> returns from step S<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to carry out the communication processing again. If an accounting error occurs at the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to carry out such retrial. Therefore, in such case, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may carry out the processing from step S<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> with the line kept connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> After purchasing the points from the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and supplementing the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> with the quantity of purchased points at step S<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> to discriminate whether or not there is any file which is made unavailable on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. For example, if it is determined at step S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> that the points are insufficient before the purchase processing, there is a file for which the information use permission flag is left in the use prohibition state. When there is an unavailable file on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and determines the number of points required for the file. If the number of points not less than the number of necessary points is stored in the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> carries out point subtraction processing at step S<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and makes the file available at step S<highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> That is, the file which was inputted to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by the user in the past but could not be used or reproduced because of the insufficiency of points is made available as the accounting is carried out when the user purchases the number of points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> If the points are insufficient again when the processing proceeds from step S<highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the file is still in the use prohibition state. In such case, the user needs to carry out the point purchase processing again. Such case is, for example, the case where expensive information is unavailable because of the insufficiency of points and the user purchased only a small number of points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Although not shown as the processing, in the case where many pieces of information are recorded on the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> while the points are insufficient, point subtraction of not more than the number of points PT and setting of the information use permission flag into the use permission state are carried out with respect to files for which the points are sufficient, but files for which the points are insufficient are left in the use prohibition state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> As described in the foregoing first accounting processing, the user can also purchase the chargeable information by setting the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into the download device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as described above. In this case, the down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> sets the file down-loaded onto the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into the use prohibition state. Similarly to the first accounting processing, in order for the user to use the file, the user must connect the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to shift the file to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and carry out the point processing, or must carry out point processing by using the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> In the case where the file down-loaded in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is shifted to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to be used, the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> regards the file shift as the input of chargeable information in the processing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and carries out the processing of step S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the subsequent steps as described above. Specifically, the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> carries out the accounting processing through the point processing and sets the file shifted to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into the use permission state. After that, the user can freely use the file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the file down-loaded to the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can also be made available in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by carrying out only the point processing at the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, without shifting the file to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The processing operation therefor of the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described with reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> monitors the connection with the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When the connection with the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is detected, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> advances to step S<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and confirms the file stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> discriminates whether or not there is any file in the use prohibition state at that time. The case where there is a file in the use prohibition state is the case where there is a file of chargeable information which is down-loaded from the down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by using the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and for which the accounting processing has not been carried out yet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Thus, at step S<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> confines the number of points of the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and discriminates whether or not the number of points equivalent to the fee for the file in the use prohibition state is left as the number of points PT. If the number of points PT is left, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> subtracts the number of points PT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at step S<highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> regards that the fee has been paid for the file in the use prohibition state stored on the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and sets the information use permission flag in the on-state, that is, the use permission state. Specifically, the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sets the information use permission flag in the on-state by directly accessing the HDD <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or through the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user can use the chargeable information down-loaded to the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> If the number of points is insufficient at step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the file in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is still in the use prohibition state and therefore the user must carry out the point purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> As the processing of FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is thus carried out, the user only needs to carry out the point purchase operation in advance for the purchase of the chargeable information, and it is the operation only on the screen as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Therefore, the user will not experience much trouble. Also, the user can purchase an arbitrary quantity of points at an arbitrary time point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Thus, though the accounting mode is similar to that of the prepaid card, a card reader and another equipments necessary for the accounting processing are not required. Also, the cost of circulation of cards is not necessary and the user need not go out to a dealer for the purchase. Moreover, in this case, since the user can be aware of the quantity of point purchase, that is, the accounting amount, the user himself/herself can be careful to avoid excessive use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the case of the first accounting processing, since the accounting processing through the communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not carried out every time the information is inputted, the user need not wait for the accounting processing and can immediately use the obtained information. In the case where the number of points is insufficient, the user only needs to purchase points after that. Therefore, it is possible to avoid such a situation that the user cannot use the obtained information because of the insufficiency of points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> In addition, the information of the down-load device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be purchased by using the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the accounting can be carried out by the point processing using the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Therefore, diversification of the means for obtaining information can be realized and the accounting processing can be smoothly carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Various modifications can be considered with respect to the second accounting processing, too. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> For example, the operation method and the range of selection of the purchase quantity by the user for point purchase are not limited to the above-described specific example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> If the number of points is reduced to a certain value or less, a warning to urge the user to carry out the point purchase may be issued, or the CPU <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may communicate with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to automatically purchase a certain number of points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> In the above-described example, when the points become insufficient, the inputted file is left in the use prohibition state. However, the point purchase processing of a specified quantity may be automatically carried out by displaying a screen to urge the user to carry out the point purchase when the points become insufficient, or by presetting by the user. Alternatively, when the points are insufficient, it may be considered to delete the stored file or to confirm the number of points before the storage to the HDD <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and prohibit the recording operation if the points are insufficient. Also, when the points are insufficient, the user may delete the stored file and carry out control to increase the number of points equivalent to the deleted file. In the above-described example, the entire processing of the point memory <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is executed by the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, the point memory may be provided in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that the processing of the point memory is executed in the portable device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the above-described examples and various modifications of the structure of the device and equipment and the processing procedures may be considered. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, accounting point information is stored into the first memory means of the terminal device and information distributed from the external source is stored into the second memory. When the distributed information is stored into the second memory, the accounting point information stored in the first memory is updated and the attributes of the distributed information are updated. Thus, the inconvenience of carrying out communication with the distribution/accounting center <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> every time information is distributed to the recording/reproducing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be avoided. </paragraph>
