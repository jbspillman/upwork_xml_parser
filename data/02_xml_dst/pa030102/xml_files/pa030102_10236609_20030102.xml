<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to tools for planning Signaling System 7 (SS7) communication networks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An SS7 network is a packet data network used for out-of-band signaling to perform call set-up and tear-down, to implement Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) services, to route traffic to interexchange carriers (IXCs), and to access database information needed to provide certain services such as 800, LNP, and LIDB. Core components of the SS7 network include switches called Signal Transfer Points (STPs). The STPs are interconnected with data links to form a core network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Connected to each STP may be several different network elements. Signal Switching Points (SSPs or central offices) route calls. Points-of-Presence (POPs) serve as sources and sinks for network traffic. POPs provide alternate local carriers and IXCs with access to the Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) serviced by the STP. Network databases (DBs) support customer services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Designing an alternative network includes adding, deleting, and moving network components, changing component capabilities, adding and modifying network services, and modifying connectivity between components. Changes to an existing network can create unintended situations. Removing an STP can leave elements disconnected from the network. Removing a database can eliminate a required service. Modifying connectivity can create load in excess of capacity on certain links and network components. Designs are further complicated by changing loads and service requirements over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, SS7 network planning has been accomplished through the use of spreadsheets. These spreadsheets only model a portion of the network such as, for example, the core network. Another difficulty is that load information has to be manually entered. Further, graphical display of the network and the effects of modifying the network are limited. As network size and complexity increases, the number of variables used to model the network is increasing beyond the capacity of the spreadsheet. Finally, a user attempting to create an alternative network does not have sufficient guidance and correctness validation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> What is needed is an SS7 network modeling tool that provides greater capabilities. The tool should guide a user through the development of an alternative network design. A graphical user interface should provide the user with an image of the network and allow the user to graphically select network components for modification. The tool should determine equipment capacity exhaustion due to maximum loads forecast for each study period and the costs for alternative networks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a primary object of the present invention to provide an SS7 network modeling tool with greater capabilities than existing tools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to guide the user through the development of an alternative network design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a graphical user interface showing the user with an image of the network and allowing the user to graphically select network components for modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to determine equipment capacity exhaustion due to maximum loads forecast for each study period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to determine costs for alternative networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In carrying out the above objects and other objects and features of the present invention, a system is provided for planning a Signaling System 7 (SS7) network over a sequence of study periods. The system includes at least one planning database containing information on network traffic, network component locations, and network component connectivity. A load module determines peak loads for each STP in the core network based on network traffic, component locations, and component connectivity, and stores the peak loads in the planning database. A forecast module determines equipment capacity exhaustion for each STP, network DB, and core network link during each study period and determines network costs based on peak loads and an alternative network design provided by a user. A graphical user interface guides the user through a sequence of designing steps, each step having to be correctly completed before the next step in the sequence is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the sequence of steps through which the graphical user interface guides the user includes permitting changes to the core network, permitting changes to the number of POPs and DBs, rehoming elements left unconnected to STPS, assigning SSPs to POPs, assigning SSPs to DBs, and permitting voluntary rehomes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the graphical user interface shows graphical representations of the network on a display and allows the user to modify the network by selecting displayed graphical representations of network components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A method is also provided including obtaining network traffic information from the network, determining current peak loads for each STP based on the network traffic information, and specifying an alternative network through a sequence of designing steps, each step having to be correctly completed before the next step in the sequence can be started. For each study period, the method includes forecasting peak loads for each STP based on the current peak loads for each STP, determining equipment capacity exhaustion for each STP, network DB, and core network link in the alternative network based on the forecasted peak loads, and determining costs for the alternative network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The above objects and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an SS7 network architecture is shown. An SS7 network, shown generally by <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is comprised of STPs interconnected by links to form a core network. Several different switch models may be used as STPs. Each model has different capacity and engineering parameters. Network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has STPs arranged in three tiers, but the present invention applies to any SS7 network configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Local STP (LSTP) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> serves a LATA, shown generally by <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Every SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in LATA <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected either directly or indirectly to LSTP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Connections between SSPs have been omitted for clarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Each LSTP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> handles inter-LATA traffic to and from the IXCs via POPs, one of which is indicated by <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, attached to each LSTP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. POPs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provide long distance services to regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs), which would otherwise be prohibited from transporting calls across the boundaries of LATA <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. POP services include AT&amp;T&reg;, MCI&reg;, Sprint&reg;, and the like. Each SSP is required to have access to each POP service. Connection between POPs is not shown for clarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Each LSTP may also service one or more network DBs, one of which is shown as <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Generally, network DBs are either Service Control Points (SCPs) or Intelligent SCPs (ISCPs). Network DB services include Local Number Portability (LNP), Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN), 800 number translation, Custom Local Area Signaling Service (CLASS<highlight><superscript>SM</superscript></highlight>), Line Information Data Base (LIDB), and the like. Each SSP may be required to have access to a particular network DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Each LATA <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> belongs to a region, one of which is indicated by <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For the three-tiered network shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each LATA <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be connected to one or more territorial STP (TSTP) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. TSTP <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may also service SSPs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and POPs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> within a LATA <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each TSTP <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is connected to regional STP (RSTP) <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. For convenience, any STP will be referenced as <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> block diagram of an exemplary system-according to the present invention is shown. An alternative to network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is planned to be operated over a sequence of study periods. The configuration and loading of the alternative network is based on current conditions for network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Current conditions for network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are stored in a planning database, shown generally by <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown, planning database <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is implemented as NETCAM database <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, NetPilot&trade; database <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, location database <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and tool database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, planning database <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is implemented using at least one relational database, such as O<highlight><smallcaps>RACLE </smallcaps></highlight>from Oracle Corporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> NETCAM database <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes traffic numbers, traffic averages, and outages for network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This data is collected in near real-time from network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by NETCAM module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. NETCAM is a program originally developed by U S West, Inc. and Ericsson, Ltd. NETCAM pull <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is a set of data describing network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> over a period, such as a half hour. NETCAM module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> periodically accesses network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to obtain NETCAM pull <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and stores the data in NETCAM database <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Specific data may include total message signaling units (MSUs) for each STP, global title translation (GTT) counts by translation type of each STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, octet loads on core network links, octet loads on SSP A-links, and octet loads on POP links. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> NetPilot&trade; database <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes information on network component connectivity. N<highlight><smallcaps>ET</smallcaps></highlight>P<highlight><smallcaps>ILOT</smallcaps></highlight>&trade; from Bell Communication Research is a program to manage signaling system resources. The data in NetPilot&trade; database <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> describes the core network connectivity between STPs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and network elements connected to each STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The data in NetPilot&trade; database <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be entered manually without using N<highlight><smallcaps>ET</smallcaps></highlight>P<highlight><smallcaps>ILOT</smallcaps></highlight>&trade;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Location database <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes the location of each component in network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> together with demographic information. In a preferred embodiment, component geographic location is specified using V and H coordinates as is well known in the telecommunication art. Information includes metropolitan service area (MSA) for each SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, LATA codes for each SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, North American Numbering Plan (NANP) data, and NXX (local exchange) data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Tool database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> holds data directly accessible by the user as described below. Tool database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> also holds a location identifier for each combination of state, city, MSA, and LATA in which a component of network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> appears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The data in planning database <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preprocessed in four modules indicated as aggregation module <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, configuration module <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, location module <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and load module <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Aggregation module <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> reads raw NETCAM data <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> from NETCAM database <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> collected over a period of time, typically seven days, and condenses the data. This condensed data is stored as aggregated NETCAM data <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in tool database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Configuration module <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> accepts raw NETCAM data <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> from NETCAM database <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, raw network element data <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> from NetPilot&trade; database <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, location data <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> from location database <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and location identifiers <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> from tool database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Configuration module <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can generate a new location identifier <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> for a component of network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> located in a combination of state, city, LATA, and MSA not previously required. The new location identifier <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is stored in tool database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Configuration module <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> also develops current network configuration data <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which is stored in tool database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Location module <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> accepts location data <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> from location database <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and organizes location data <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> into a usable form, producing formatted location data <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which is stored in tool database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Load module <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> uses aggregated NETCAM data <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> from tool database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to produce peak hours data <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which is stored back in tool database <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In order to reduce the complexity of calculations and decrease calculation time, only peak loads for each STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are used in planning calculations. These peak loads occur during the busiest one hour over a seven day period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Many users may utilize the present invention concurrently. Computer system <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> provides an interface between a user and the present invention. As such, computer system <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> includes a display and a keyboard, pointing device, or other data entry and selection tool as is known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, each user has computer system <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> running forecast module <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and graphical user interface (GUI) <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Computer system <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be a workstation such as, for example, a Sun S<highlight><smallcaps>PARCSTATION</smallcaps></highlight>, or a personal computer such as, for example, an Apple M<highlight><smallcaps>ACINTOSH</smallcaps></highlight>. Alternatively, one or both of forecast module <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and GUI <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may run on a central computer and computer system <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may function as a terminal. The precise hardware used to implement computer system <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is not critical to the present invention as will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of forecast module <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and GUI <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are provided with regards to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 7</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> show flow diagrams illustrating operation of embodiments of the present invention. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the operations illustrated in are not necessarily sequential operations. Similarly, operations may be performed by software, hardware, or a combination of both. The present invention transcends any particular implementation and aspects are shown in sequential flow chart form for ease of illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> flow diagram of an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The flow diagram describes a method for planning an SS7 network over a sequence of study periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Network traffic information is obtained in block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. NETCAM module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> automatically obtains NETCAM pull <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> containing information about network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on a periodic basis. The traffic information is aggregated to show loads for each STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for each hour in a seven day period and is stored in planning database <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Current peak loads for each STP are determined in block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. It is possible to perform planning using all of the hourly load information obtained in block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. However, this would be computationally expensive and does not greatly increase the accuracy of planning calculations. Therefore, the hour producing peak loads and the corresponding load values for each STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are extracted and used in planning calculations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> An alternative network is specified. The goal of planning is to determine the effects that modifying network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may have on current and future network performance. The alternative network configuration is created by modifying the design of existing network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Due to the complexity of network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the close interaction of network components, great care must be taken when modifying the design of network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The present invention guides the user through a sequence of planning steps, each step having to be correctly completed before the next step in the sequence can be started. A preferred sequence of planning steps is described with regards to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> To assist in creating the alternative network and in interpreting the results of planning simulation, GUI <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> displays graphical representations of the network on a display and allows the user to modify the network by selecting displayed graphical representations of network components. Examples of graphical displays are described with regards to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 7</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As part of specifying the alternative network, the user may enter the number of study periods desired. A check is made to see if any study periods remain in block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. If not, simulation is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Peak loads for STPs are forecast in block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. For each study period, the peak loads for each STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are determined based on current STP loads, network connectivity, changes to services provided, and predicted demand for services. For each STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, loads expressed in calls per second are calculated by peak hour, by service, by study period, and by base year STP pair. Loads for each SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are found by calculating a scale factor based on the A-link octet traffic from SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to corresponding STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, then multiplying the base year STP pair load by the scale factor. Loads are determined for services such as plain old telephone service (POTS) local, POTS ATT&reg;, POTS MCI&reg;, POTS Sprint&reg;, CLASS<highlight><superscript>SM</superscript></highlight>, 800, LIDB, CND, AIN0.0, AIN0.1, LNP, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Equipment capacity exhaustion is determined in block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The ability of network components to handle peak loads is found. If load exceeds capacity for a component, the user is notified. Maximum equipment required for each network component is also determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Cost is determined in block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Each component description includes capital costs such as purchase price and salvage value as well as expenses such as installation, removal, annual maintenance, yearly lease costs, costs per mile, and the like. The total cost of the alternative network as well as costs by component type and expense type are determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Peak load forecast, equipment capacity exhaustion, and cost determination are repeated until every study period has been completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Variations on the above method are possible within the spirit and scope of the present invention as will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, peak loads may be forecasted for every study period prior to determining any equipment capacity exhaustion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> flow diagram of steps for creating an alternative network design according to the present invention is shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The core network may be changed in block <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Arbitrary changes to the network of STPs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and interconnecting links may be made. In any study period, STPs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and core links may be installed or retired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The core network is checked for validity in block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. If any STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is isolated from the remainder of alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid. If alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid, block <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is reentered, allowing the user to modify the alternative core network design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> POPs and DBs may be added and removed in block <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. POPs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and DBs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be installed or retired in any study period. The user specifies STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to which a modification will be made, the operation to be performed (add or delete), and the type of element (POP or DB). In the case of DB <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> addition, a-name, model, and list of services provided are entered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A check is made to determine if all services and traffic is supported in block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. If the removal of DB <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> leaves network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> without a required service or if the removal of POP <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> leaves network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> without access to a category of IXC traffic, alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid. If alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid, block <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is reentered, allowing the user to install the appropriate DB <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or POP <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Elements with no STP home are rehomed in block <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. As a result of removing STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, some network elements including SSPs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, POPs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and DBs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be left without a home STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. If any disconnected elements exist, the user is prompted to select a new home STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for each network element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A check is made to determine if all network elements are homed in block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. If any network element is not homed to one of STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid. If alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid, block <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is reentered, allowing the user to rehome network elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> SSPs are assigned to POPs in block <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. If POP <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is retired, SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which was previously assigned to POP <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> no longer has access to the IXC traffic provided by POP <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Each such SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> must be assigned to POP <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> connected to alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> providing the required IXC access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A check is made to determine if all SSPs are assigned to POPs in block <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. If any SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is not assigned to POP <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for each IXC access provider, alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid. If alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid, block <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is reentered, allowing the user to reassign SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to an appropriate POP <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> SSPs are assigned to DBs in block <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. If DB <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is retired or supports a new service, SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may not have access to the service supplied by DB <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Each such SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> must be assigned to DB <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connected to alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that provides the required service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A check is made to determine if all SSPs are assigned to DBs in block <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. If any SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is not assigned to DB <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for each required service, alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid. If alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid, block <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is reentered, allowing the user to reassign SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to an appropriate DB <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Voluntary rehomes are performed in block <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> At this point, alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is valid. However, the user may desire different STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> homes to SSPs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, POPs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and DBs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and may desire different POPs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and DBs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to service SSP <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The user selects the affected STP <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> then makes the desired changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A check is made to determine if all rehomes are correct in block <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. If any rehome is not correct, alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid. If alternative network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is invalid, block <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is reentered, allowing the user to correct voluntary rehomes. </paragraph>
