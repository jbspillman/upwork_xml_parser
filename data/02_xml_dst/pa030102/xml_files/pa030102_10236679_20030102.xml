<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention is directed to an automated system for applying a fluid to an object. The automated system is used to position a fluid applicator in the proper position with respect to the object on which the fluid is being applied. The automated system also has a mechanism for replacing worn fluid applicator tips on the fluid applicator. The automated system utilizes a compliance mechanism that enhances the ability of the automated system to retain contact with the object. The automated system is easily interfaced with robots or other automated devices such as programmable fluid dispensing systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One of the primary applications of the automated system is the automotive glass industry where the fluid applicator is used to apply various fluids to the edge of the windshield, lights, and back window. The automated system will be generally described with regard to this particular automotive application. However, it should be understood that these inventions are also suitable for a wide range of other fluid applications. The automotive glass application is only one use and is not meant to limit the scope of the applications for the inventions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention is particularly adapted for the production of glazing units or window assemblies for automotive vehicles, although it will find utility generally in a great many other fields. Installation of fixed window units in earlier automotive vehicles generally involved manual installation of the glazing unit using suitable mechanical fasteners such as metal clips for securing the unit in the vehicle body, applying sealant around the marginal edges of the glazing unit, and positioning decorative trip strips around the unit to cover the junction between the marginal edges of the glazing unit and the adjacent portions of the vehicle body. Assembly and installation of such units was relatively slow and costly inasmuch as a considerable amount of labor was required. The procedure was not readily adaptable to being speeded up to accommodate increased automobile production line rates, nor was it adapted to being automated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Efforts to overcome these disadvantages resulted in numerous improved window structures. Thus, unitary window assemblies were developed wherein a sheet of glass was provided with an adjacent peripheral frame, with a casting or gasket of molded material extending between the frame and the peripheral margin of the window to hold the glass sheet within the frame. Fasteners provided at spaced locations along the frame permitted the entire assembly to be guided into position over an appropriate opening in a vehicle and secured to the vehicle as a unit. Such unitary window units reduce the time required and simplify installation in the vehicle opening. However, due to the labor required in manually assembling the frame and gasket on the sheet of glass, the structures are relatively costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More recently, in order to eliminate the manual assembly, so-called encapsulated glazing units have been developed wherein individual sheets of glass or laminated glass units are formed with integral frame or gasket members molded and cured in situ by a reaction injection molding (RIM) process. One such process and resulting product is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,561,625 to Weaver. Such encapsulated glazing units can be fabricated with a minimum of hand labor, and the resulting units can be readily attached to the portions of the vehicle body defining the window openings during assembly of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As described in the aforementioned patent, such encapsulated units are fabricated by disposing a predetermined portion of the marginal periphery of a sheet of transparent material within a mold structure. A polymeric gasket forming material is injected into the mold cavity and cured in situ on the sheet to encapsulate the marginal peripheral edge portion of the sheet. The resulting assembly can then be readily attached to the body portion defining the periphery of a window opening during manufacture and assembly of a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Due to the nature of the glass surfaces, it is known that the gasket materials may not form a permanent, long term bond directly to the glass. Thus, they may not maintain adhesion to the glass surface for a length of time consistent with the life of the automobile. Exposure to weather moisture and sunlight, as well as other factors, may cause the gasket material to loosen from the glass with the passage of time, and ultimately to separate entirely from the glass. In order to improve the adherence of the gasket material to the glass and increase the service life of the encapsulated units to an acceptable level, it has been common practice to apply a coating of a liquid primer material to the affected surface of the glass prior to formation of the gasket thereon. Heretofore, this has been accomplished as by manually painting a band of the primer material along the appropriate edge portion of the glass panel. Such prior art procedures may, for example, utilize a brush periodically dipped in a container of the primer material, or a plastic squeeze bottle containing the primer material and having a suitable dispensing dober. In any event, the procedures are not entirely satisfactory in that they are time-consuming, labor-intensive and may not result in a satisfactory coating of the primer material. Thus the primer layer, which is generally a urethane material, should be applied as a uniform, continuous, relatively thin band in order to function properly. Should the layer be of excessive thickness, it may separate within the layer along a cleavage plane, resulting in failure of the bond. Of course, if the layer is not of sufficient thickness or if certain areas are not coated, the primer layer would likewise be ineffective for its intended purpose. The primer, and particularly the solvent therefore, may be toxic in nature so that manual application thereof, particularly when using an open container of the primer, may require use of protective equipment by the workers. Such manual application processes also generally result in waste of the primer material and generally messy conditions in the work place. Due to the difficulty in controlling the width of manually applied bands, it may also be necessary to mask the work piece prior to application of the primer material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, as will be readily apparent, the existing procedures for applying primer material to the edges of sheet material are not entirely satisfactory, and there is a need for a system for efficiently applying a band of primer of a desired uniform thickness and width to such sheet material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention consists of a modular workstation that is interfaced with a programmed robot to apply a liquid to a product, primarily glass, in a precision pattern, utilizing specialized and unique flow applicator tips. Some of the applicator tip designs have been documented in U.S. Pat. No. 5,131,349. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a system for applying a uniform band of primer composition along selected portions of the peripheral margin of sheet material such as glazing units of the like. The band may be applied to either or both marginal surfaces, as well as to the edge portion and to interior marginal surfaces of spaced adjacent sheets where desired. The invention has particular utility in applying such bands of primer composition to the marginal edges of glazing unit upon which a plastic frame or gasket member is to be molded in place. However, as will be readily appreciated, it may as well be utilized for application of bands of liquid material in general to any suitable marginal surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A family of interchangeable applicator tips is provided for use with a dispenser adapted to provide an on-demand supply of primer compound to the tip in use. The different applicator tips of the family have configurations particularly adapted to applying bands of primer compound along selected peripheral margins of a sheet member, and each is of composite construction including a relatively rigid base member to which is bonded a soft wicking and absorbent body for contacting and transferring to the sheet surface the layer of primer compound. The tips are readily attachable to and removable from a fluid dispenser or other dispensing unit providing a supply of the primer compound. The fluid dispenser, or a plurality of the fluid dispensers, may be incorporated in a modular work station including a closed storage and supply container for the primer compound and a solvent flush system for cleaning hoses and fluid dispenser of the reaction priming resins. The fluid dispenser may also be mounted upon an oscillating carriage whereby in one position of the carriage, spent applicator tips are removed and replaced by new tips by a loader, and in another position the marginal edges of glazing units are moved through the applicator tips by a robot arm for application of a band of the priming compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The operational design consists of a column or post-like structure that houses a shaft that rotates or indexes in this structure. Two arms that are positioned 90&deg; apart are mounted on the top of the shaft. At the end of these two arms, a fluid dispenser is mounted to a compliance fixture. Two cantilevered beams are attached to the column housing in spaced apart and parallel relationship to the rotating arms. Upon these beams are mounted articulated fixtures to remove spent applicator tips from the fluid dispenser and then reattach a new applicator tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The object upon which the fluid is to be applied is usually on a robot. The object is then moved by the robot relative to the fluid dispenser to apply the fluid coating to the desired areas on the object. Devices other than a robot can also be used to provide the movement of the object during the fluid application process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The design and the unique operational programmable functions, provide precision liquid lay down on glass and other products in a controlled and rapid automatic production cycle. This design with the employment of two fluid applicators on separate indexing arms provides many advantages such as: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> 1. The ability to apply, with precision, fluid primers that consist of two liquid products that must be applied in precise band width, volume, mil thickness, sequence, etc.; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> 2. The ability to use the same liquid within both fluid dispensers, but employ different applicator tips to give variable lay down; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> 3. A means to clean the surface before the lay down of primer, activator, adhesives, etc.; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> 4. The ability to use any combination of two pairs of applicators and any combination of two liquids; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> 5. The unit can be used with only one arm and applicator tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the process to apply primers, adhesives, promoters, etc. to automotive glass and like application, it is necessary to maneuver the specialized tip applicators into many angular modes to provide constant regulated pressure contact with the glass. It is also necessary to maintain band width coverage on all designated surfaces and at the same time control the mil thickness of the fluid that is applied to meet the required quality standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> There are many applications where the design of the product demands a non-uniform and constant changing band width on one or two edges or on one or both sides of the light and/or a mixture of these variables on a single piece of glass. To accomplish such requirements, it is frequently necessary to employ two different applicator tip designs. On one portion of the product, it may be necessary to have a vertical placement of the applicator tip with respect to the product. On another section of the product, it may be necessary to use the applicator tip in a horizontal mode. Many design factors of the product dictate the ability or inability to perform the required liquid lay down in one automated cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The capability to perform this type of complex pattern for liquid application in a rapid, single automatic cycle has been accomplished with the design of the compliance mechanism that can rotate within its mounting to position the fluid dispenser in either a vertical or horizontal position or an angular position between vertical and horizontal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a device for applying a uniform band of primer material to selected peripheral marginal areas of a sheet member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide such a device which minimizes waste of the primer or adhesion promoting material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide such a device which is adapted to apply a primer material along the peripheral margin of either or both major surfaces of the sheet member, the edges thereof, and the interior peripheral margins of a pair of spaced sheet members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a device and system of operation where different fluids can be applied to the object that is to be coated and the fluids are applied in a predetermined sequential manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the invention is to provide such a device requiring a minimum of manual labor in its operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the invention is to provide such a device utilizing a closed supply system so as to minimize escape of solvent materials at the work station and entry of moisture to sensitive reactive fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Another object is to provide precision metering to maintain set parameters of material usage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a review of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The invention is directed to an automated system for applying a fluid to an object. The automated system utilizes a compliance mechanism that enhances the ability of the automated system to retain contact with the object. The automated system is easily interfaced with robots or other automated devices such as programmable fluid dispensing systems. The features of the invention will be more readily understood by referring to the attached drawings in combination with the following description of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the automated system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the present invention where a fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> having an applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is used to apply a fluid to an object (not shown). A compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is utilized to assist in maintaining the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in contact with the object during the coating operation. A robot <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is utilized to advance the object past the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> during the coating operation. The fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is mounted on a movable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> to allow the fluid dispenser to be moved or rotated into and away from the position where fluid is applied to the object. The automated system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> provides a fluid application system that can apply a precise and repeatable layer of fluid to an object. The use of the robot <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> allows larger objects to be easily handled and for the coating process to be done in a rapid fashion. The automated system is flexible and can readily accommodate changes in the object that is to be coated or the configuration of the coating that is to be applied to the object. The specifics of the automated system and components that comprise this system will now be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has an L-shaped bracket <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The first and second legs <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are positioned substantially perpendicular to one another. A first reinforcing member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is secured to the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and to a portion of the second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which is adjacent to the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The first reinforcing member provides additional support and rigidity for the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The second reinforcing member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is secured to the second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and provides additional rigidity and support for the second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. A slide mechanism <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> such as a linear ball bearing is positioned on the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the side of the leg that is opposite to the first reinforcing member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A slide mechanism <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is also positioned on the second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> on the side that is opposite the second reinforcing member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. A first fluid pressure actuation drive means such as a fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is secured to the slide mechanism <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> on the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A second fluid pressure actuation drive means such as a fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is secured to the slide mechanism <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> positioned on the second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The first and second fluid operated cylinders <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are dual acting cylinders with fluid supply ports <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> located at each end of the cylinders. In practice, it has been found preferable to use low friction fluid operated cylinders for the compliance mechanism. In particular, glass lined low friction fluid operated cylinders have been found to work particularly well. However, other types of low friction cylinders can also be utilized. The fluid supply ports are disposed for supplying fluid to either side of the piston (not shown) located in the interior of the cylinders. A piston rod <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected to the piston and extends from one end of the cylinders. The piston rod <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is secured to a first bracket <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that extends from the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in a direction substantially perpendicular to the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The first bracket <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> extends from the side of the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that is opposite to the first reinforcing member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The first bracket <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is also disposed to be substantially parallel to the second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The piston rod <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for the second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is secured to a second bracket <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> that extends from the second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The second bracket <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> extends from the second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The second bracket <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> extends from the side of the second leg <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> that is opposite to the second reinforcing member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The second bracket <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is disposed to be substantially parallel to the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the first and second fluid operated cylinders <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are supplied with fluid under pressure to actuate the cylinders, through supply lines <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Each supply line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is connected to a self-exhausting regulator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The supply lines extend from the regulators and are connected to one of the fluid supply ports <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on the first and second fluid operated cylinders. The regulators <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> act to reduce pressure build up in the first and second fluid operated cylinders <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> so that the force necessary to advance the piston rod in the cylinders does not change over the distance of travel for the rod. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> having a fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is secured to the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. An example of a fluid dispenser that can be used is the Model 5000 fluid dispenser sold by Designetics. The fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is positioned on the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> extends beyond the end of the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> usually extends beyond the end of the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is opposite to the end where the piston rod <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> extends from the cylinder. The fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is constructed to have a guide flange <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that engages the edge of the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> that is to be coated with fluid to position the fluid applicator tip with respect to the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> usually contacts at least one other surface of the object. The applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> usually has a felt or foam pad that applies the fluid to the object that is to be coated. The applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> applies fluid to the object in a manner well known in this field. Examples of applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> that can be used with this invention are Part Numbers Series 11 through Series 67 sold by Designetics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In some applications the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> may not have guide flange <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to position the applicator tip with respect to the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. In this situation, the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> will have to be placed very precisely with respect to the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> so that the fluid layer is applied to the desired area. Since the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> only engages one surface of the object, the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will only be able to effectively accommodate relative movement between the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> in one direction. In this application, it is only necessary to have the fluid operated cylinder that controls motion in the one selected direction be operational. Usually, the fluid operated cylinder that does not control motion in the desired direction would be effectively locked to prevent motion in a direction that is not controlled by the position of the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is secured to a bar <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. A flange <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is secured to and extends from the bar <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The end of the flange <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that is spaced apart from the bar <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is disposed at an angle with respect to the bar <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and a positioning plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is secured to this end of the flange <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The positioning plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is also disposed at an angle with respect to the bar <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The positioning plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is releasably secured to positioning member <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> that is connected to a support arm <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The positioning member <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is disposed at the same angle with respect to the support arm <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> that the positioning plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is disposed at with respect to the flange <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. A releasable securing means <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> such as a bolt <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and a nut <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is used to releasably secure the positioning plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> to the positioning member <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. In practice, it has been found to be preferable that the positioning member <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and positioning plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> be disposed at a 45&deg; angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> show the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the fluid dispenser positioned in a vertical orientation. FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> show the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the fluid dispenser positioned in a horizontal orientation. It should be understood that the fluid dispenser will work satisfactorily in either orientation or in any position between these two orientations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In operation, the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is utilized to place a fluid layer or strip on an object that is positioned adjacent the compliance mechanism. Usually, the object is moved with respect to the compliance mechanism during the fluid application process. However, it is also possible for the compliance mechanism to be moved relative to the object during the coating process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> To begin the coating process, the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> which is a biased position for the compliance mechanism. In the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are positioned at the end of the length of stroke for the cylinders. This is accomplished by supplying fluid to the fluid supply ports <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on each side of the piston (not shown) located in the cylinders so that the piston is advanced to substantially its fully extended position for each of the cylinders. The first and second fluid operated cylinders are low friction cylinders and only a very small force is required to operate or move the piston in the cylinders. The piston rod <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> that is connected to the piston in the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected to the first tab <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that extends from the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. As the piston is advanced in the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the piston rod <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> will be caused to extend or retract into the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by the movement of the piston. Since the piston rod <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected to the first tab <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, this causes the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to be advanced with respect to the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Since the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is mounted on slide mechanism <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> that has very little resistance to movement, it is very easy to advance the first fluid operated cylinder with respect to the first leg <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is supplied with fluid through the fluid supply ports <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the manner just described for the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and as described above, it only requires a very small force to advance the piston (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Once the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are positioned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the weight of the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the fluid pressure for the fluid supplied to the fluid supply ports <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> will essentially control the resistance to movement for the first and second fluid operated cylinders. When the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is positioned in contact with the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> on the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, it is desirable to maintain the fluid applicator tip in contact with the object during the application process. In most applications, the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> has a change of shape, contour or there are irregularities in the object that it is necessary for the fluid applicator tip to move in both a horizontal and vertical direction to maintain contact with the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The fluid applicator is connected to a fluid supply system and an example of a suitable fluid supply system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,131,349 and generally identified by reference numeral 93 of the &apos;349 patent. The description of this fluid supply system described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,131,349 is hereby incorporated by reference into this patent application. However, it should be understood that other fluid supply systems could also be utilized with the present invention and such other systems will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When the coating operation begins, the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is brought into position adjacent the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The object is then moved to engage the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> causes the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to move to substantially the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. This is the central or neutral position for the first and second fluid operated cylinders <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. From the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> can be advanced or retracted in two directions a relatively equal amount to accommodate changes presented by the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> during the fluid application process. The fluid supplied to the fluid supply ports <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on the first and second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are balanced in a way so there is a slight bias on the cylinder in the direction toward the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The amount of the bias can be controlled by the pressure differential of the fluid supplied to either side of the piston in the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The self-exhausting regulators <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> substantially eliminate pressure buildup in the first and second fluid operated cylinders <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> during the operation of the cylinders. The regulators <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> assist in having the biasing force maintained at substantially the desired level as the first and second fluid operated cylinders <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are caused to move during the operation of the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In most applications, the biasing pressure differential is relatively small since a light biasing force is all that is necessary to properly position the fluid applicator tip. Also, it is important that the biasing force created by the pressure differential does not unduly restrict the ability of the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to move with respect to the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In practice, it has been found that a biasing force of from about 5 ounces to about 40 ounces works well in keeping the application tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in contact with the object that is being coated. It has been found especially preferable to utilize a biasing force from about 12 ounces to about 36 ounces to keep the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in contact with the object that is being coated. This low biasing force creates a feather light touch that allows the applicator tip to work most effectively. The light contact between the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the object also prolongs the life of the applicator tip. The overall speed will also dictate resistive force, especially around corners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> When the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is being coated by the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, any movement away from the fluid applicator tip in a vertical direction will result in the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> moving toward the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> due to the biasing force in the first fluid operated cylinder. If the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> moves in a vertical direction toward the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will move in the same direction as the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and keep the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in contact with the surface of the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Since the biasing force in the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is relatively small, only a small amount of pressure is necessary to cause the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to move in response to the change in position of the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The small biasing force in the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> results in a very light touch or feel for the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> on the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Since the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a low friction cylinder and is mounted on the slide mechanism <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, there is almost no resistance to movement of the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> other than the biasing force in this cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> If the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> moves away from the second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the biasing force in this cylinder will cause the second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to move toward the object and keep the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in contact with the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. If the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> moves in a direction toward the second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, it is only necessary to overcome the biasing force in this cylinder to cause the second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to move with the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and maintain the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in the desired position with respect to the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> show the range of motion for the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in vertical and horizontal direction. In practice, it has been found that this range of motion is satisfactory to accommodate most objects <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> on which a fluid is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In some applications, it may be necessary to have a stronger biasing force in the first fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the second fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to maintain proper positioning for the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to achieve the desired application of the fluid. If higher pressures are required, it is only necessary to adjust the fluid pressures in the first and second fluid operated cylinders <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to increase the resistance of movement in the cylinders and achieve the desired fluid applicator tip pressure on the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> It is frequently necessary to change the angular position of the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to apply a fluid in a desired manner to an object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. To change the positioning of the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, it is only necessary to loosen the releasable securing means <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and change the orientation of the positioning plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> with respect to the positioning member <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the positioning plate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> has been rotated relative to the positioning member <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> so that the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is now disposed in a horizontal orientation instead of the vertical orientation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. It is possible to locate the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in other positions between the positions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the positions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is an essential feature that allows the automated system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to properly interact with the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> that is to be coated. The compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides the light touch and range of movement for the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to keep the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in contact with the surface of the object that is to be coated. All of the previously described advantages of the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are desirable features for the proper operation of the automated system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is mounted on a rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> that is disposed substantially perpendicular to the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that more than one rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> can be mounted on the rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. In practice, it has been found desirable to have two rotatable arms mounted on the rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. The two rotatable arms <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> are usually positioned 90&deg; apart although other orientations can be used for the rotatable arms. The fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> that are positioned on each rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> can be used to dispense different materials. An example would be clear and black primers that are components of a two-part priming system. The different materials can be applied consecutively or with a time delay between the application of each component. It is also possible for different dispensing equipment to be positioned on the rotatable arms so that other materials such as adhesives, abrasives, mastic bonding materials, masking liquids, cleaning compounds, lubricants, etc. can be applied to an object if desired. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, one or more sensors <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can also be positioned on the rotatable arms <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> or the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to monitor the position, thickness, uniformity and quality of the material that is applied to the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The sensors allow the continuous monitoring of the coating operation. If desired, signaling devices or alarms can be incorporated into the monitors to alert an operator if there are difficulties in the coating operation. The monitors can also be designed to stop the coating operation if the problems exceed set parameters for a particular coating operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is rotatably secured to a base <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> that supports the rotatable shaft.

It should be understood that other mechanisms can be used to rotate the rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A structural column <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> is positioned around the rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and the column extends from the base <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> to the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The column <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> is secured to the base <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> so that the column does not rotate when the rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is caused to rotate. A beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is slidably positioned on the column <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> so that the beam can be located between the base <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. A suitable securement means (not shown) is utilized to secure the beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the desired position on the column <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. The beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is usually disposed so that it is substantially parallel to the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> also extends from each side of the column <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. Positioned on one end of the beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is a fluid applicator tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and a fluid applicator tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. On the other end of the beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is another fluid applicator tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and a fluid applicator tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The details of the removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> will be discussed below. The fluid applicator tip removal and replacement stations are disposed on the beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> adjacent the plane of motion of the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be advanced along the column <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> to position the fluid applicator tip removal and replacement stations in the desired location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the fluid tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> has a stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> that contains a U-shaped portion <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> that defines a slot <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. The stripper bracket defines an arcuate surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that is located on the portion of the bracket that engages the applicator tip. The stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is mounted on a fluid actuated cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> that is used to move the stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> from an inactive position to an engagement position. In the engagement position the slot <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> of the U-shaped portion <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is positioned to engage the fluid actuator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> located on a fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> that is mounted on the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is positioned on the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. When the stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is in the engagement position, the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is positioned in the slot by the rotation of the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. As the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> continues to rotate the arcuate surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on the stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> causes the applicator tip to advance away from the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and removes the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> from the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. In this manner the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is removed from the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and falls into a receptacle (not shown) for used applicator tips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the fluid applicator tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> has a rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> where a plurality of fluid applicator tips are positioned. The rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is disposed so that the fluid applicator tips are forced by a rodless cylinder <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to the first end <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> of the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. The rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is positioned in a generally horizontal position to supply applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> when the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is in a vertical orientation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. However, it should be understood that other means such as gravity or vibration action can be used to advance the applicator tips in the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference> show another mechanism to advance the applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> along the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> to the tip replacement position. In this embodiment a coiled spring <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is positioned on each side of the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> adjacent the end where the applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are replaced in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The coiled spring <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> has an end <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> that is advanced from the coiled spring and engages a moveable pusher <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. The moveable pusher <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> is designed to fit in the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and to advance the applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> due to the force placed on the moveable pusher by the coiled springs <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. The coiled springs are designed to have a substantially uniform retraction force over the designed length for the coiled spring. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows another mechanism to supply applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. In this mechanism, the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is positioned in a vertical orientation and the applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are fed to the tip replacement station by gravity. The rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is positioned in this generally vertical position to supply applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> when the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is in a horizontal orientation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. An escapement mechanism (not shown) can be positioned in the end of the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> to ensure that only one applicator tip is positioned at the end of the rack. A gate type of mechanism or other device can be used as the escapement mechanism. It is also possible to use a magazine type of storage device for the applicator tips instead of the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. Again, an escapement mechanism can be used with the magazine type of storage system to ensure that only one applicator tip is present at the replacement area. Positioned beneath the first end <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> of the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is a fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> has a rod <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> that extends from the cylinder <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in a direction towards the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. The rod <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> has an end <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> that is configured to engage the applicator tips so that the applicator tips can be advanced without damaging the applicator tips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In practice, it has been found desirable to provide the applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> with a configuration that has a consistent uniform shape that can interact with the end <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical cap section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that is disposed to properly engage the end <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. If all the applicator tips that are used with the automated system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> contain this cap section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> this provides a uniform surface that can be engaged in the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. In addition, the cap section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is also disposed to provide a uniform surface for engagement with the arcuate surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to facilitate applicator tip removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Activation of the fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> causes the rod to advance with respect to the cylinder. The first end <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> of the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is disposed to be positioned immediately adjacent a fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> that does not contain a fluid applicator tip. When the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is so positioned with regard to the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, the fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> can be activated so that the rod <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is advanced and pushes a fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> from the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> into engagement with the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> whereby a new fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is positioned on fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows an applicator tip <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> being positioned on a fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The applicator tip <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> has a passageway <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> that is in communication with a felt or foam pad <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> that is used to apply fluid to an object. The passageway <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> has a shoulder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and terminates in an aperture <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> that is in communication with the pad <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. The fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> has a hollow shaft <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> that extends from the fluid dispenser and into the passageway <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21, a</cross-reference> needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is positioned in the hollow shaft <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. The needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be moved to control the flow of fluid through the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The applicator tip <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is properly positioned on the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> when the hollow shaft <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is in contact with the shoulder <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> in the passageway <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and passageway <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> are designed so that there is a snug fit between these two components. A sealing mechanism <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> such as an O-ring can be positioned on the shaft <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> to ensure that there is a seal between the passageway <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and the shaft <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are normally mounted on the beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> so that they function with an applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> that is positioned at a pre-selected orientation. Usually the applicator tip is positioned in a vertical or horizontal orientation and the tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are mounted on the beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to properly interact with the pre-selected position for the applicator tips. If it is necessary to change the position or orientation for the applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> for a particular fluid application, a rotary actuator <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 25</cross-reference>, can be used to move the applicator to the desired orientation for interaction with the tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The rotary actuator <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> can be programmed to rotate the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to the desired orientation to allow the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to properly interface with the removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> whenever the removal station is activated. In this operation, the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> would always be in the proper location regardless of the orientation of the applicator tip during the application of fluid to the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. It is also possible to position the tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> on the beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> so that the positioning of these stations can be changed to properly interface with applicator tips that are positioned at different orientations. In fact, a device similar to the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> could be utilized to change the position of the tip removal and tip replacement stations so that these stations properly interface with the applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24, a</cross-reference> docking station <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> can be positioned on the beam <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> at a location that can interface with the applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> when the applicator tips are not being used to apply fluid to the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The docking station <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> can function to keep contamination from coming into contact with the applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> when the applicator tips are not being used for coating purposes. It is important to keep dirt, high humidity air and other impurities from coming into contact with the applicator tips. The docking station <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> includes a reservoir <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> that is positioned immediately adjacent the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> when the applicator tip has been moved by the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> to a position where the applicator tip does not apply fluid to the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. A solvent can be present in the reservoir <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> of the docking station to keep the applicator tips in condition for applying fluid. The solvent can migrate from the reservoir <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> to interact with the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. For most applications, the fluid dispenser will be orientated at the docking station so that the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> extends towards and is immediately over the reservoir <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> so that the applicator tip essentially closes the reservoir. When the applicator tip is not at the docking station, a cover can be placed over the reservoir <highlight><bold>193</bold></highlight> to retain the solvent in the reservoir. The solvent can also function to keep the fluid in the applicator tips from changing condition so that the fluid remains in a condition or state that is suitable for coating the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In operation, the automated system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is positioned as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to apply fluid through a fluid applicator tip mounted on a fluid dispenser to an object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. As shown in these figures, various applicator tips are being utilized to apply a fluid to an object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> that is being supported and moved by a robot <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in these figures, there are many different applicator tip and fluid deposit patterns that can be used with this invention. When it is desirable to replace the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> mounted on rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is caused to rotate so that the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is positioned at the tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is caused to move in this direction through the actuation of fluid actuated cylinder <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> which is connected to the bell crank mechanism <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> that is mounted on the rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> that supports the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. As the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> moves toward the tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, fluid actuated cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is actuated to bring the U-shaped portion <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> into alignment with the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. In this position the slot <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> of the U-shaped portion <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is disposed to extend between the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Rotation of the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> by the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> results in the slot <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> and the arcuate surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> engaging and removing the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> from the dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The arcuate surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> causes the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to advance away from the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> as the applicator tip moves along the arcuate surface. Eventually, the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is removed from the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> by this motion. The fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> that is removed from the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is allowed to fall into a receptacle (not shown) positioned beneath the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> continues rotation to a home position to reload a new applicator tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> When the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is positioned in the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, above the first end <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> of the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is actuated to advance configured end <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of the rod <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> in a direction toward the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The advancing rod <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> engages a fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> positioned at the first end <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> of the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and causes the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to advance toward the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The rod <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is advanced until the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is securely received by the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Once the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is secured to the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> the rod <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is advanced in a direction away from the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is free to rotate away from the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> on programmed command. The rod <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is advanced in a direction toward the fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> the replacement tips in the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> are caused to advance by a pusher, by the force of gravity or by another mechanism until another replacement tip is located at the first end <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> of the rack <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> within the escapement mechanism. As previously described, a rotary actuator <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can be used to position the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in the proper orientation to interact with the tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. With a new fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> can be moved by programmed command to a position where the fluid applicator tip can apply a layer of fluid to the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The tip removal operation takes place very quickly as the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is advanced by the rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. A new applicator tip <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> can be inserted very quickly by the operation of the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Thus, removal and replacement of an applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> can be accomplished without significantly impacting the application of fluid on an object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> During the application of the fluid, the supply of fluid to the applicator tip can be controlled to prevent too much or too little fluid being applied to the object. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> has a needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that can control very precisely the flow of fluid through the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> being dependant on the position of the needle valve and the pressure of the fluid supplied to the needle valve. A fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is connected to the needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to move the needle valve. The cylinder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is used to move the needle valve to open and close the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. An adjustment screw <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is positioned at one end of the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to control the position of the needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the open position. Movement of the adjustment screw <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> changes how far the needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will move when the needle valve is acted upon by the cylinder to open the needle valve. Such movement or adjustment of the needle valve changes the size of the orifice <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Being able to vary the size of the orifice <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> allows the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to accommodate coating fluids of varying viscosity and rheology and still properly interface with the fluid supplied under pressure to the fluid dispenser. The needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> provides a very effective means for controlling the amount of fluid that is supplied to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> on the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can meter a very precise quantity of coating fluid to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> also provides a very positive open and closed control for the fluid that is supplied to the applicator tip. In some applications, such as a corner on an object, it may be necessary to open and close the needle valve very quickly to ensure that the proper quantity of fluid is supplied to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to properly coat the surface of the object. The needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> also provides very quick and precise supply and shut off of the coating fluid at the start and completion of the coating operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference> show a fluid supply system <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> that can be used to supply fluid to a fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The fluid supply system <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> has a first pressurizable container <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and a second pressurizable container <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>. A weight scale <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> can be positioned beneath the first and second containers. A lid <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is positioned on the first and second containers <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>. The first container <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> contains a first fluid that is to be applied to an object and the second container <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> contains the same or a different fluid than the first container. A plastic liner <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> can be positioned in the first and second containers to hold the appropriate fluids. The plastic liner <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> can be a disposable product and acts to separate the fluid that is to be applied to an object from the interior surface of the first and second containers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The fluid supply system <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> is used to provide a very controlled and metered supply of fluid to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> on the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The supply of fluid is also recordable in a precision manner. Each metering pump <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is designed to provide a very specific and controllable volume of fluid to the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The metering pumps have a variable precision speed control, which is directly related to the positive volume output of the metering pumps. Therefore, the metering pump <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> allows for a very accurate calculation to be made on the precise amount of fluid that is supplied to the fluid dispenser and therefore to the object. The fluid output of the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> must be precisely controlled to match the velocity or surface speed of the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> that is passed over the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> during the coating operation. The surface speed of the object will usually vary as corners and curves are encountered on the moving object. To precisely match the fluid supplied to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> with the surface speed of the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a sequential activation of the metering pump <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and the closing of the needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is utilized to control the flow of fluid to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to achieve the desired application of fluid to the object. The adjustable needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with rapid open and close capabilities works in unison with the sequential operation of the metering pump to provide a precision supply of fluid to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to coat the object in the desired manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In practice, it has been found desirable to have applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> that have good fluid retention properties so that the fluid is maintained in the applicator tip when the metering pump <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and needle valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are cycled to the off or closed positions. If the applicator tip does not have good fluid retention properties, the fluid will continue to flow from the applicator tip and fluid will be deposited in too thick of a layer or in the wrong locations on the object <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. It has also been found desirable for the applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to have a shape that holds only a small volume of fluid. The small volume of fluid makes it easier to control the flow of fluid from the applicator tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A dip tube <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> extends through the lid <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> and into the interior of the first and second containers. The dip tube <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> is provided to remove the fluid from the first and second containers. The dip tube is connected to one end of a tube <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> and the other end of the tube is connected to a metering pump <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. Each metering pump <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is connected by a hose <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> to a fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> that is mounted on a rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> as previously described. The lid <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> has a pressure port <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> that is used to supply a gas under low pressure to the first and second containers. The gas is supplied at a pressure from about 0.2 psi about 5 psi. The gas acts to feed, at a low pressure, the fluid in the first and second containers to the metering pumps <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. Usually, the gas is a dry inert gas such as nitrogen. The nitrogen gas forms a protective, moisture resistant barrier over the fluid in the first and second containers. A source of air under pressure (not shown) is also connected to the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to actuate the needle valve in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In operation, the fluid that is to be supplied to the fluid dispensers <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> for coating an object is positioned in the first and second containers <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>. The fluid is positioned in the plastic liners that are positioned in the first and second containers. The lid <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is secured to each container so that the dip tube <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> extends into the fluid in the containers. A gas under pressure is then supplied to the pressure port <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> to place the fluid in the container under pressure. The gas under pressure forces the fluid into the dip tube <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>, through the tube <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> and to the metering pump <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. The metering pump <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> then supplies the fluid through hose <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> to a fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> dispenses the fluid in the manner previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The first and second container <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> can be sized so that the quantity of fluid that they hold is correlated to a defined operating period for the coating equipment. Usually, a single shift of a shift is selected so that there will be as little waste of coating fluid as possible. The plastic liners <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> are usually disposable so that they can be removed and disposed of along with an unused coating fluid. The plastic liners <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> greatly simplify clean up of the first and second containers. A cleaning fluid can also be provided to flush any coating fluid from the dip tube <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>, tube <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>, metering pump <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, hose <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> and fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to assist in cleaning the coating apparatus if the coating apparatus is not going to be used for an extended time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The automated system provides a very flexible and adaptable machine for dispensing and laydown of reactive liquids, adhesives, primers and other materials. When the automated system is used with a robot to advance the object to be coated, the automated system is particularly useful for applying a fluid to several different objects. When a particular product has reached its production goal, the system, including the robot, can be programmed for the next object to be coated. The program parameters for any particular object can be stored to memory and recalled anytime that it is desirable to again process that particular object. This flexible and simple job changeover increases the usefulness of the automated system and creates maximum utilization of the system. It also allows the priming module to have a practically perpetual life as the automated system can be used with virtually any product that falls within the physical size limitations of the automated system and the robot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> shows an alternative arrangement for docking stations, tip removal and tip insertion. The compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are positioned on rotatable arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> that are rotatably secured to post <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> as previously described. The post <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and arms <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> are supported by a base <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. An arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> extends from each side of the post <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. The arms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> extend in substantially opposed directions from the post. Only one arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is shown in detail for clarity in the drawings. However, the opposite side of the fluid application system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is a mirror image of the side that is shown in detail. The device of this figure is used to apply a fluid layer to an object as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> A docking station <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> substantially as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is slidably positioned on the arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> can be operatively connected to the docking station to move the docking station into a desired position with respect to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> on the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> when it is desirable to place the applicator tip in a protective environment that keeps the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in condition for future application of fluid to an object. A tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> that is substantially similar to the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is also slidably positioned on the arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is connected to the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> by bracket <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> so that the tip removal station moves with the tip replacement station along the arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the docking station <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> are operatively connected so that they move in unison along the arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A fluid operated rodless cylinder (not shown) is positioned in the arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and is connected to the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> for moving the docking station <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>, tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> along the arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> has a stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> previously described with respect to the tip removal station described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is moved into an engagement position with respect to an applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> when the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is advanced along the arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be in position to supply replacement fluid applicator tips <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The docking station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, the tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> all function substantially in the same manner as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In operation, if it is desired to replace an applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> on which the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are operatively connected is rotated in a direction toward one of the tip removal stations <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The fluid operated rodless cylinder in the arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is activated to bring the stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> into a position where the stripper bracket is in the path of travel of the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. As the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is advanced by the rotating arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> engages the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and removes it from the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in the manner previously described. The rodless cylinder also moves the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> into alignment with the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> from which the stripper bracket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> has just removed the applicator tip. When the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is in alignment with the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> by the linear transfer along arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the tip replacement station can be activated to insert a new applicator tip in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> in the manner as previously described. As the docking station <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, the docking station is moved out of alignment with the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> during the tip replacement operation. Once the new applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> has been positioned on the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, the fluid dispenser on this side of the fluid application system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is again available to apply fluid to an object. As there is a tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> on each side, this function can be performed on both sides of the fluid application system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The rotary actuator that is positioned on each arm <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> can be used to rotate the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to a position where the fluid dispenser is properly located to interact with the tip removal station <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the tip replacement station <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> can be activated to position the docking station in the desired position with respect to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> An additional docking station <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> can be positioned on a support member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that extends from the base <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. The support member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is located substantially equidistant between the two arms <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that extend from the post <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. A fluid operated cylinder <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is positioned on the support member <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and can be used to position the docking station <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> in the desired location with respect to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The docking stations <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> shown in this figure function substantially in the same manner as previously described. The docking stations <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> provide three separate locations where the, applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> can be held in a protected environment when it is not being used to apply a fluid to an object. The docking stations <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> can also be moved by the activation of the fluid operated cylinders <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> which are effective to move the docking stations away from the applicator tip <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> so that the applicator tip can be used to apply fluid to the object. </paragraph>

The first opening <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> and the port <highlight><bold>277</bold></highlight> are sized so that there is space around the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> that extends into the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. A desiccant container <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the third opening <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> on the Tee fitting <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>. Usually, the desiccant container <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is connected to the third opening by a tube <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> that is connected to the first end <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> of the desiccant container <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. The tube <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> extends through the third opening and is in communication with the interior of the Tee fitting <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight>. The second end <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight> of the desiccant container <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> has a closeable opening <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight> that can be opened to the atmosphere. The third opening <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> is in communication with the interior of the Tee fitting and thus into fluid communication with the interior of the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The third opening <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> is secured to the desiccant container <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> in a manner whereby air cannot pass through the third opening <highlight><bold>287</bold></highlight> into the interior of the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The air from the atmosphere must pass through the desiccant container <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to enter the interior of the Tee fitting <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> and thus into the interior of the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> that extends from the second opening <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> in a direction away from the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to a positive displacement pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. An example of a positive displacement pump that can be used is a peristaltic pump that engages the small diameter tube to positively advance material along the tube. The fluid is retained in the small diameter tube and the pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> acts upon the tube to advance the fluid. In the case of a peristaltic pump, the pump squeezes the tube to advance the fluid. It is important that the fluid not come into direct contact with the components for the pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. From the positive displacement pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>, the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> enters fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>. The fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> defines a passageway <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and a tip region <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. The passageway <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> extends through the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> and through the tip region <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. A fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is usually positioned on the tip region of the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>. The application tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> can have an applicator pad or a brush <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> that applies the fluid to the objects as is well known in the art. The fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> defines a cavity <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> that is in fluid communication with the passageway <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> that extends through the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> in the tip region <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. The cavity <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> is in direct communication with the applicator pad or brush <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. A tube lock <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> can be positioned in the passageway <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>. The tube lock <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> allows the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> to be inserted into the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> in a direction whereby the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> can be advanced through the passageway <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> in a direction towards the tip region <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. The tube lock <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> acts to restrict or prevent the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> from moving in the opposite direction in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>. A substantially similar tube lock <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> can be positioned in the second opening <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> of the tee fitting <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> to control the advance of the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> through the second opening. The tube lock <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> in the second opening <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> is designed to allow the small diameter tube to be advanced in a direction through the second opening towards the interior of the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The tube lock <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> in the second opening will prevent or restrict the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> from being advanced from the second opening <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> in a direction away from the interior of the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> extends from the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, through the pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>, through the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> and delivers the fluid directly to the applicator pad <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. The fluid is contained in the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> until the fluid is delivered to the applicator pad <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. The fluid does not come into contact with any of the components of the fluid delivery system other than the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and the applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> has a substantially constant diameter and the fluid moves through the tube with a substantially uniform flow rate. The uniform flow rate acts to prevent the build up of fluid, fillers in the fluid and/or contaminants in the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>. The uniform flow rate in the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> acts to wash the tube and prevent build up of particles that can impair the flow of fluid through the fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, the components that deliver the fluid from the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> to the object to be coated are relatively low cost components that are easily replaceable in the fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In operation the fluid supply system is utilized by placing the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> on the securing device <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and engaging the securing device to securely position the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> in the securing device. The container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> can be actual container that is used by the manufacturer to deliver the fluid to customers. The closure on the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is removed and replaced with the closure <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>. Once the closure <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> is positioned on the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the second opening <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> in a direction through the tube lock <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> and the Tee fitting <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> so that the small diameter tube enter the interior of the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and come into fluid communication with the fluid located in the container. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> is then positioned in the positive displacement pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> wherein the positive displacement pump can act upon the small diameter tube to advance fluid from the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The small diameter tube is then inserted through the passageway <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> in a direction towards the tip region <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. The tube lock <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> can be used in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> to prevent the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> from being advanced in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> in a direction away from the tip region <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> should extend the entire length of the tip region <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> and into the cavity <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> defined by the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. To facilitate the positioning of the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> it has been found useful to advance the small diameter tube through the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> so that the small diameter tube extends from the tip region <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> can then be trimmed flush with the end of the tip region <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> using a knife or other cutting device. The cavity <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> in the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is sized to snugly engage the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> so that fluid supplied through the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> is supplied directly to the applicator pad <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> on the applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> To pump fluid from the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> the closeable opening <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight> on the desiccant container <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is opened to expose the desiccant container to the atmosphere. The positive displacement pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> can then be engaged to act upon the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> to pump fluid from the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The pump acts upon the tube to advance the fluid but the fluid does not come into direct contact with the components of the pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. The pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> is activated to deliver a precise amount of fluid to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. The speed of the positive displacement pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> can be controlled or adjusted to provide an exact metered volume of fluid to the applicator tip. As fluid is pumped from the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> makeup air can be drawn through the closeable opening <highlight><bold>239</bold></highlight> on the desiccant container <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to provide makeup air in the interior of the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. Since the air is passing through the desiccant container <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, moisture will be removed from the air and effectively no moisture will enter the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> that could contaminate the fluid contained therein. The fluid from the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> passes through the tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and into the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>. As the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> extends all the way through the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> and into engagement with the cavity <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> in the applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, all of the fluid is delivered directly to the applicator pad <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> for the applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. In most applications, it will be desirable to activate the shaking mechanism <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> to slightly agitate the fluid in the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> during the application of the fluid to the object that is to be coated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The fluid that is used to coat the object is usually difficult to clean from the fluid supply system. The coating fluids can be very reactive wherein they setup readily when exposed to atmospheric conditions making it difficult to clean pumps and fluid applicator devices that are used to supply and apply the fluid to the object. In the present fluid supply system, the fluid only comes into contact with the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> that passes through the fluid supply system. When it is time to clean the fluid supply system of the present invention, the small diameter plastic tubing <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and closure <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> can be removed from the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. It is desirable to have the pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> impinge upon the small diameter tube to act as a check valve that assists in retaining the fluid in the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>. When the pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> constricts the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, it restricts the ability of the fluid to move in the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> until the impingement on the small diameter tube is released. The end of the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> that extends into the container can be wiped clean with a disposable cloth as the tube is removed from the container. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> is also removed from the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> with the fluid dispenser elevated so that fluid does not escape from the small diameter tube. The ends of the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> can be placed at an elevation that prevents fluid from being discharged from the small diameter tube or the ends of the small diameter tube can be placed in an appropriate receptacle and the fluid allowed to drain from the small diameter tube. In most cases, it is preferable to allow the fluid to cure and harden in the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> prior to disposing of the small diameter tube. Once the fluid has cured and hardened, the small diameter tube can be removed from the closure <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> without contaminating the closure. If the small diameter tube locks <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> are used on the closure <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> and the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>, it will be necessary to advance the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> in the proper direction to remove the small diameter tube. As all of the fluid is retained in the small diameter tubing <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, it is not necessary to clean the component parts of the fluid supply system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. This is a major advantage as it is frequently necessary to use volatile solvents to clean the fluids that are used to coat an object. When it is desired to use the fluid supply system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to again supply fluid to coat an object, it is only necessary to supply a new small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> to the system. The tube can be readily inserted into the Tee fitting <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> in the closure <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> on the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and fed through the positive displacement pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. It is also easy to feed the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> into the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> to have the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> engage the cavity <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> on the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. The length of small diameter tubing <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> that is necessary can be premeasured and precut to facilitate the installation of the tubing. Since the desiccant container <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> never comes into the contact with the fluid, it is not necessary to clean or replace this portion of the fluid supply system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, until its service life is over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> used in this supply system usually has a diameter from about {fraction (1/16)} to about {fraction (5/16)} of an inch. In practice, it has been found preferable to use a tube having a diameter of {fraction (5/32)} of an inch. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> is particularly useful with a fluid having a relatively low viscosity. Fluid with a water like viscosity works particularly well with the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>. If the viscosity of the fluid is too high it will be difficult to move the fluid through the small diameter tubing. For such higher viscosity fluids, the fluid supply system previously described in this patent application is more suitable. The fluid will be retained in the tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> until it is removed from the positive displacement pump <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. The pump also acts on the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and constricts the tube in a manner that restricts the flow of the fluid in the small diameter tube and acts to retain the fluid in the tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> which assists during removal of the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> during the cleaning of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The small diameter of the tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and the controlled pumping action of the positive displacement pump supply just the desired metered amount of fluid to the applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. Since there is essentially no oversupply of fluid, this is a very efficient system. As many of the fluids that are used to coat an object are very volatile and release objectionable vapors, the precise supply of fluid greatly reduces the vapors emitted to the atmosphere during the coating operation and provides a constant, precise coverage on the object that is coated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> All of the components that are used to supply fluid and to coat the object are disposable. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and the applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> can be removed from the fluid supply system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and thrown away. As the fluid does not come into contact with any other parts of the fluid supply system (other than the container <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> for the fluid) there is no need to clean or replace any of the components of the system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> due to contamination from the coating fluid. Because the original shipping container for the fluid can be used, there is no need to transfer the fluid to another container and contaminate the fluid. Accordingly, it is not necessary to use any objectionable solvents to clean the components of the system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. In addition the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> are low cost components that are not expensive or difficult to replace. The elimination of clean up cost and difficulties more than offsets the cost of the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> and applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> that are replaced. In fact the applicator tip <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> would normally be replaced if the system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is not used for a period of time that requires replacing the tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</cross-reference> show additional features of the automated system that can be utilized to apply a fluid to an object. In this example a compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> that is essentially the same as the compliance mechanisms previously disclosed in this patent application is releasably secured by mounting means <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> to support arm <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. The box design compliance mechanism has protective panels along the sides of the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> to reduce contamination on the moving parts of the compliance mechanism from contaminates in the atmosphere. The compliance mechanism has a first leg <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and a second leg <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> as previously described. The second leg <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is connected to the mounting means <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. A rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> is positioned on the first leg <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. A fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> is mounted on fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> that is mounted on a plate <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> that extends in a direction away from the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> on each side of the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. The fluid applicator tips <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> are disposed substantially 180&deg; apart on the rotary actuator. Supply lines <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> are used to supply the fluid that is used to coat the object <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> with fluid. The supply lines <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> are small diameter tubing similar to the tubing described with regard to the fluid supply system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. With that configuration for the fluid supply, the supply lines <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> extend through the plates <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> and extend directly into the applicator tip <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> to supply fluid to the applicator tip. The plates <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> are sized to space the applicator tip <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> from the compliance mechanism <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> as the applicator tips are rotated by the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. The size of the plates <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> is dictated by the size of the applicator tips <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. The applicator tips have a brush or pad <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> for applying fluid to the object <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> as previously described in this patent application. Drive lines <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> can be used to supply fluid under pressure to rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to cause the rotary actuator to rotate. However, it should be understood that other drive means can be utilized to cause the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to rotate. The rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> is designed so that it will rotate through 180&deg; arc so that each fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> can be brought into position adjacent the object <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> so that each applicator tip can be used to apply a fluid to the object <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. The applicator tips can apply the same fluid to the object <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> or they can apply different fluids to the object. It is also possible that the applicator tips can have a different configuration so that each applicator tip will apply a different layer of fluid to the object <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. Appropriate stop mechanisms (not shown) can be utilized with the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to limit the degree of rotation of the rotary actuator to the desired positions. As previously described, the rotary actuator is usually limited to movement through a 180&deg; arc. To facilitate the rotation of the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, the supply lines <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> are provided with enough length to rotate with the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> through its arc of rotation. A guide for <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> can be connected to the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to engage the supply lines <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> to keep the lines in the desired position during rotation of the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>359</bold></highlight> provide a path of communication from the solvent reservoir <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> to the solvent pad <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> located on the opposite side of the arcuate member <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight>. The arcuate member <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> is sized so that the chamber <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> formed by the arcuate member and the end plates <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> is of sufficient size to accommodate the fluid applicator tips <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> that are used to apply a layer of fluid to the object <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

A quantity of solvent will be positioned in the solvent reservoir <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> and the solvent will pass through the plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>359</bold></highlight> in the arcuate member <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> so that the solvent will saturate the solvent pad <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight>. The pad <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> will wick the solvent from the reservoir <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> and the solvent will be held in the pad. The solvent that is used to saturate the solvent pad <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> will migrate from the solvent pad and create a solvent saturated atmosphere in the chamber <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> where the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> is positioned. The solvent saturated atmosphere will act upon the applicator pad <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> to prevent the fluid on the applicator pad <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> from drying out or becoming contaminated when the applicator tip is not being used to apply a fluid layer to the object <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. The solvent vapor is usually lighter than air so that the solvent atmosphere in the chamber <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> will generally be retained in the chamber <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> by the placement of the arcuate member <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> and the end plates <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</cross-reference> show another application of a rotary actuator that can be utilized to apply a fluid layer to an object. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> is mounted on a support bracket <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight>. The support bracket <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight> is usually mounted on one leg of a compliance mechanism as previously described. Drive lines <highlight><bold>369</bold></highlight> are connected to the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> to cause the rotary actuator to rotate in a manner well known in the art. It should also be understood that a stepper motor or a servo mechanism could be used to rotate the rotary actuator. A small diameter tube <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> passes through the portion of the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> that is caused to rotate. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> is secured to the rotational portion <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> of the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> that is caused to rotate by the fluid supplied through the drive lines <highlight><bold>369</bold></highlight>. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> extends through the rotary actuator <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> and the end of the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> extends through a fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> and into a fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight> as previously described. The fluid applicator tip shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> is relatively long and has a long applicator pad <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> that is used to apply a layer of fluid to an object <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In operation, fluid is supplied to the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> in a manner previously described to provide fluid to the applicator pad <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight> of the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight>. The applicator pad <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> can be positioned to apply a layer of fluid to the object <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> that has a specified width. If it is necessary to change the width of the layer of fluid, the fluid actuator <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> can be activated to rotate the rotational portion <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> causing the small diameter tube <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> to rotate which in turn causes the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight> to rotate. As the fluid applicator tip rotates, the position of the applicator pad <highlight><bold>379</bold></highlight> with respect to the object <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> can be changed to vary the width of the fluid layer that is applied to the object. A controller (not shown) can be programmed to position the applicator tip in the desired location on a particular portion of the object <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to mount the support bracket <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight> on a rotary actuator (not shown) so that the fluid applicator tip <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight> can be moved into and out of position adjacent the object <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight>. In fact, a support bracket <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight> can extend from each side of the rotary actuator (not shown) so that different fluid applicator tips can be brought into position adjacent the object <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight>. This will allow the different applicator tips to provide different fluids to the object or to have applicator tips with different shapes as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> shows another feature of a fluid dispenser that can be used with the fluid apply systems shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> has a body <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> that defines a cavity <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight>. A spherical bearing <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight> is positioned in the cavity <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight>. A swivel <highlight><bold>391</bold></highlight> is matingly positioned in the spherical bearing <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight>. The swivel portion is free to move in one direction in the swivel bearing <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight> as shown by the broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. The swivel member <highlight><bold>391</bold></highlight> has tip region <highlight><bold>393</bold></highlight> that extends from the body <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>. The tip region <highlight><bold>393</bold></highlight> is designed to have a fluid applicator tip (not shown but as previously described) positioned on the tip region. A passageway <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight> extends through the swivel member <highlight><bold>391</bold></highlight> and the passageway is designed to receive a small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> as previously described. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> is used to supply fluid to the fluid dispenser and fluid applicator tip in the manner previously described. The swivel member <highlight><bold>391</bold></highlight> provides a small amount of movement in one direction that allows the applicator tip to accommodate small irregularities or changes in the object that is to be coated with a fluid. The fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> is usually used with a compliance mechanism as previously described. The compliance mechanism provides compensating movement in two directions to accommodate irregularities or changes in the object that is being coated. Usually the swivel member <highlight><bold>391</bold></highlight> is positioned in the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> to provide compensating movement in another direction than that provided for the compliance mechanism. However, it should be understood that the fluid dispenser <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> can be used separately from a compliance mechanism if desired. The small diameter tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> that extends through the passageway <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight> acts as a spring or resistance means to center the swivel member <highlight><bold>391</bold></highlight> in the cavity <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight> in the body <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>. If the swivel member <highlight><bold>391</bold></highlight> is displaced from this central position in the cavity <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight>, the resilient nature of the tube <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> will apply a biasing force on the swivel member to urge the swivel member back into the central position. A resilient elastomer or plastic foam washer could also be used if more centering force is required. </paragraph>
