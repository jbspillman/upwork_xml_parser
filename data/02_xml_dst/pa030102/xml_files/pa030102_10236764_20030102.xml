<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to containers and, in particular, to systems and methods that utilize containers for storing items so that the temperature of the items may be maintained, raised and/or cooled as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Oftentimes, it is desirable to transport items, such as beverages, for example, in a portable container or cooler so that convenient access to the beverages is provided, such as while playing golf, attending sporting events, going to a beach, etc. Hereinbefore, such a container typically has been formed of either insulating material, for maintaining the temperature of previously chilled beverages, or a combination of insulating material and cooling material, such as blue ice, for instance, whereby the cooling material chills a beverage stored within the container and the insulating material tends to maintain the temperature of both the cooling material and the chilled beverages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,176, issued to Johnson, et al., discloses a beverage cooler, which includes a cylindrical freezer-pack insert to be placed into a cup, and a cover. In an embodiment of the Johnson device, the cylindrical freezer-pack insert includes removable sections to change its size, and removable plugs for putting coolant fluid into the removable sections. Since, however, the Johnson device is adapted for inserting within an individual cup, the device is limited for use in cooling one beverage at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As another example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,295,345, issued to Atkinson, discloses a cooling container for canned beverages. The Atkinson device includes a reusable concave container for carrying and cooling canned beverages having a bottom section containing a plurality of cylindrical compartments, a top section containing corresponding compartments having a slow warming cooling gel in the upper end thereof, and a shoulder strap for carrying the container. While it is apparent that the Atkinson device addresses the problem of cooling multiple beverages simultaneously, it does not, however, provide for increased cooling efficiency of the beverages stored therein, as the cooling gel is stored only in the upper end of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It also may be desirable to transport other items in a portable container. By way of example, various items, such as fluids, organs and/or other medical-related items, may require transport. Heretofore, these items typically have been transported within containers that are not specifically adapted for these items. This inadequacy also is prevalent in fields other than the medical industry. Therefore, there is a need for improved coolers which address these and/or other shortcomings of the prior art. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Briefly stated, the present invention is directed to systems and methods that utilize containers for storing and/or transporting items. In this regard, one such method includes: providing an item; providing a container, the container having: an outer shell, a cap, a storage chamber, an insulating material and a re-freezable material, the outer shell defining an interior and having at least one opening for providing access to the interior, the outer shell being formed of a substantially rigid material, the cap being configured to engage the opening, the cap being formed of a substantially rigid material and movable between an open position and a closed position, in the closed position the cap engaging the at least one opening such that the cap and the outer shell encase the interior, the storage chamber being located within the interior and communicating with the at least one opening, the storage chamber being adapted to receive the item such that the storage chamber substantially conforms to the exterior of the item, the insulating material disposed within the interior between the storage chamber and the outer shell, the re-freezable material disposed within the interior between the storage chamber and the insulating material such that the re-freezable material at least partially surrounds the exterior of the item inserted within the storage chamber, the ref-freezable material comprising an acrylate-based superabsorbent; placing the item in the storage chamber of the container; and moving the cap to the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a method includes: providing a container sized and shaped to receive an item, the container having: a storage chamber, an insulating material and a re-freezable material, the insulating material defining an interior and having at least one opening for providing access to the interior, the re-freezable material being disposed within the interior, the insulating material comprising soyoyl polyol, the re-freezable material comprising an acrylate-based superabsorbent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a method includes: providing a container, the container having: an outer shell, a lid, a storage chamber, an insulating material, and a temperature-maintainingmaterial, the outer shell defining an interior and having at least one opening for providing access to the interior, the outer shell being formed of a substantially rigid material, a lid configured to engage the outer shell and being formed of a substantially rigid material, the lid defining a lid opening and having a cap, the cap movably engaging the lid, the cap being movable between an open position and a closed position, in the closed position the cap engaging the lid opening such that the lid and the outer shell encase the interior, in the open position the lid opening providing access to the interior, the storage chamber being located within the interior and communicating with the at least one opening, the storage chamber being adapted to receive the item, the insulating material being disposed within the interior between the storage chamber and the outer shell, the temperature-maintaining material being disposed within the interior between the storage chamber and the insulating material, the temperature-maintainingmaterial comprising an acrylate-based superabsorbent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of a container includes: an outer shell defining an interior and having at least one opening for providing access to the interior, the outer shell being formed of a substantially rigid material; a lid configured to engage the outer shell and being movable between an open position and a closed position, in the closed position the lid engaging the outer shell such that the lid and the outer shell encase the interior, in the open position the lid providing access to the interior; a storage chamber formed within the interior and communicating with the opening, the storage chamber being adapted to receive at least one item; insulating material disposed within the interior between the storage chamber and the outer shell; an inner wall spaced from the outer shell and located between the outer shell and the storage chamber; and temperature-maintainingmaterial disposed within the interior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of a container includes: an interior defined at least partially by insulating material, the insulating material comprising soyoyl polyol; and a temperature-maintaining material disposed within the interior, the temperature-maintaining material comprising an acrylate-based superabsorbent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the present invention will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.</paragraph>

Storage chambers <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> preferably are adapted to receive one or more beverage containers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, such as conventional cans or bottles, with the cooler being constructed so as to chill the beverages containers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, and/or maintain the beverages of the containers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> at a suitable chilled temperature, as described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Access to the storage chamber(s) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, such as for the insertion and/or removal of beverage containers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, preferably is facilitated by one or more caps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which removably engage the shell <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, in the preferred embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> plurality of caps <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are provided along a lower surface of the shell <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, with each of the caps being constructed as a &ldquo;screwoff&rdquo; cap so that engagement of each of the caps with the shell is facilitated by rotating the cap relative to the shell. However, in other embodiments, engagement of the cap and shell may be facilitated by a friction fit, or other suitable means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Preferably, storage chamber(s) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are defined by inner walls of a re-freezable material chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which is adapted to receive and retain a quantity of re-freezable material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the re-freezable material chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is adapted to conform to the exterior surface of a beverage container <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and, therefore, fills the interstices formed between the various containers. Preferably, in embodiments which are adapted for receiving one beverage container within each storage chamber, each beverage container is surrounded and engaged by the inner wall of the re-freezable material chamber, i.e., on all of its sides and its top. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An insulation chamber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> preferably is provided between the re-freezable material chamber <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the shell <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, insulation chamber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is filled with an efficient insulating material <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, such as polyurethane foam or other suitable material. So configured, each beverage container inserted within a storage chamber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is encased by a layer of re-freezable material, as well as within a layer of insulation for maintaining the temperature of the re-freezable material at a suitable temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Additionally, cooler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be provided with a handle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the cooler is easily transportable. The handle may be formed of numerous suitable materials, such as plastic or leather, for instance, and may be fastened to the cooler in any conventional manner so that the weight of the cooler and any beverage container stored therein does not cause the handle to separate and detach from the shell <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, various numbers and arrangements of storage containers <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be provided for storing and cooling various numbers of beverage containers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which depict a representative alternative embodiment of the cooler of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, cooler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an outer shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a lid assembly <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As described in greater detail hereinafter, shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and lid <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> cooperate to form a protective enclosure for transporting and/or storing items placed within an interior of the container. Preferably, shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed of a substantially rigid material that is adapted for protecting items placed within the container. Additionally, lid <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> preferably is formed, at least partially, of substantially rigid material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, lid <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> incorporates a cap or door <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that is adapted to alternately provide and deny user access to the interior of the container. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, door <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> includes a recess <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> that is adapted to receive the fingers of a user so that the user may urge the door from its closed to its open position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, assembly of the container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be described in greater detail. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> layer(s) of insulation <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> preferably is disposed within the interior of the container. In some embodiments, insulation <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is provided adjacent an interior surface of the outer shell. An insert <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is adapted to be received within the interior. The insert defines a storage chamber <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, which is adapted to receive one or more items. Re-freezable material <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> preferably is disposed between an exterior surface of the insert and the layer(s) of insulation <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Engagement of the insert with the outer shell also may tend to retain the insulation <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and re-freezable material <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in position within the interior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As shown in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, lid <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a top <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> as well as door <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Top <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is adapted to engage the outer shell so as to provide a mounting platform for the door. In some embodiments, a gasket <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is provided between the top and the insert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Insulation also may be provided within the door. More specifically, the door may be formed with an insulation-receiving recess <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that is sized and shaped for receiving a layer(s) of insulation <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In order to maintain the insulation <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in position relative to the door, a door insulation retainer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be provided that is adapted to securely engage the door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate moving the door from its closed position (depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) to its open position (depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), pivots <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the door are received within orifices <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> so as to enable pivoting of the door about the pivots. In some embodiments, a spring <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is provided for securing the door in the closed position. In particular, spring <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> urges a latch <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> of the door toward engagement with a recess <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the latch and recess are aligned, the latch forms an interference fit, thereby tending to maintain the door in its closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> handle assembly may be provided for facilitating transport of the container. Preferably, handle assembly <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> includes a strap portion <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>. Each end of the strap portion preferably is adapted to engage a strap guide <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> of the container, which may be formed on the lid, for example. In some embodiments, a handle may be provided at an intermediate portion of the handle assembly. In these embodiments, the handle <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> preferably is formed of a substantially rigid material and is mounted to the strap so as to provide a portion of the handle assembly that is readily suited for grasping by the hand of a user. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, ends of the strap are secured to the strap guides by hook and loop material <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> although, in other embodiments, various other mechanisms for securing the strap to the container may be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be configured with an item-receiving retainer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Item-receiving retainer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> defines one or more item-receiving cavities <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> that may be specifically sized and shaped to conform to an exterior surface of an item to be received therein. For example, the item-receiving cavities <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> are each specifically configured to receive a test tube or vile <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Preferably, an exterior surface of the item-receiving retainer is adapted to engage an interior surface of the insert and is configured so that cooperation of the lid and the outer shell maintains the item-receiving retainer within the storage chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In addition to substantially maintaining relative positions of items stored within the container, the material of the item-receiving retainer may be suitably selected so as to provide shock absorbing. In these embodiments, such as those embodiments formed of a foamed material, for example, the item-receiving retainer may reduce the tendency of an item to break within the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, various configurations of item-receiving retainers may be provided. More specifically, multiple item-receiving retainers may be provide with a given container, with each item-receiving retainer being adapted to receive various configurations of items for storage within the container. So provided, the container may be adapted so as to specifically accommodate transporting and cooling of particularly sized and shaped items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a container in accordance with the present invention is depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an outer shell <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> that is sized and shaped to receive an insert <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. When insert <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is received by shell <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, a gap <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> is formed. Insulation (not shown) can be placed in gap <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> between the outer shell and the insert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> also includes a storage chamber <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> that is defined by an inner shell <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>. Inner shell <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is received by insert <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> so that a second gap <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is formed. Gap <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive temperature-maintaining material (not shown) so that the temperature-maintaining material is located about the sides and/or bottom of an item placed within the storage chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Access to the storage chamber is provided by a removable lid <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>. Lid <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> can optionally house insulation and/or temperature-maintaining material. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the lid includes a nozzle <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> that allows liquid to be drawn from the storage chamber when in an open position. So configured, the container can be used to store various types of items, such as liquids (which can be accessed via the nozzle) and beverage cans (which can be accessed by opening the lid). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Note, the outer shell, insert and inner shell can be held in an assembled configuration by various techniques. For instance, when a foam-type insulation is used, the foam can be injected into gap <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> so that a portion of the foam contacts the inner shell. This enables the insulation to perform as an adhesive for bonding the inner shell to the outer shell and insert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, which depict another embodiment of a container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes multiple side surfaces that extend upwardly from a base (shown more clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). In particular, container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes sidewalls <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, each of which extends upwardly from base <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. The sidewalls and the base define an interior storage chamber <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> that can be enclosed when a lid <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>, e.g., a removable lid, is used to engage the sidewalls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the base, sidewalls and lid are shaped to interlock with each other so that temperature-maintaining material <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> surrounds the storage chamber. More specifically, each of the base, sidewalls and lid includes a temperature-maintaining material chamber, e.g., chambers <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>, that retains temperature-maintaining material. By way of example, the temperature-maintaining material can be a refreezable material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each of the base, sidewalls and lid, in addition to incorporating a temperature-maintaining material chamber and associated temperature-maintaining material, includes an insulation chamber (<highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>) with insulation <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> arranged therein. Note, the various chambers can be defined by a substantially rigid material that also can be used to form the exterior shell <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Attachment of the base, sidewalls and lid to each other can be accomplished in numerous manners. By way of example, one or more of the sidewalls could be hingedly attached to the base. Hinged attachment can be facilitated by hinge mechanisms (not shown) or by a portion of the material of the exterior shell (not shown), for example, that is adapted to flex or bend to accommodate movement of the sidewall with respect to the base. Note, several different attachment configurations will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> container of the invention can include one or more temperature-maintaining material chambers that are adapted to permit removal of the temperature-maintaining material. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, this can be accommodated by a sidewall <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> including an opening <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is sized and shaped so that the temperature-maintaining material <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> can be removed, such as for freezing, and then re-inserted into the chamber through the opening for use. Note, depending upon the type of temperature-maintaining method used, the material may be packaged so that it does not break apart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Various insulation and temperature-maintaining materials can be used. For example, polyurethane foam can be used as the insulation, and a gel-forming polymer such as polyacrylate/polyalcohol copolymers can be used as the temperature-maintaining material. Clearly, various other materials could be used depending upon characteristics such as the intended operating temperature range, desired weight of the container, and stability/compatibility within the item(s) stored, among others. The selection of the particular materials is considered within the knowledge of one of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Clearly, various other arrangements can be used for providing the outer shell, insulation, and temperature-maintaining material so that an item placed within the storage chamber of the container can be protected and/or have its temperature maintained. Cut-away views of additional configurations are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, insulation <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and temperature-maintaining material <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> are arranged between an outer wall <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> and an inner wall <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> of a container. Of particular interest, a gas chamber <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> is provided between the insulation and temperature-maintaining material. The gas chamber is adapted to receive gas <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>, such as an inert gas, or other gas that is considered suitable for increasing the insulating properties of the container. Depending upon the particular properties of the insulation and temperature-maintaining material, these materials may be adequate for defining the gas chamber and maintaining the gas therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment that includes a gas chamber is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the gas chamber <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, which is located between the insulation <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and the temperature<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> maintaining material <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, is defined by an inner wall <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> of the insulation chamber <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> and an outer wall <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> of the temperature-maintaining material chamber <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight>. Thus, this embodiment uses additional structural elements for maintaining the location of the gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the base <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and sidewalls <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of a container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are depicted in a disassembled or unfolded configuration. In this configuration, the sidewalls and base exhibit a generally flattened structure. Note, the lid <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is not attached to the base-sidewall assembly <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. Note, hinge mechanisms <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> attach the sidewalls to the base. The embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> also includes a hanging component <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, which in this case is a ring that can be used for hanging the container during storage, for example. For instance, the ring could attach the container to a hook suspended within a freezer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> also depicts an embodiment of a storage container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in its disassembled or unfolded configuration. In particular, sidewalls <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> are attached to base <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Compared to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, however, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> includes a lid <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> that is hingedly attached to the unfolded structure. In particular, the lid is attached to sidewall <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In those embodiments that are configured to unfold into a generally flattened structure, it is shown that the space taken up by the structure is somewhat less than that used when the sidewalls and lid are assembled, such as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. This unfolded configuration is considered advantageous, in that less volume is required within which to place the container. By way of example, when multiple containers are to be placed within a freezer so that the temperature-maintaining material can be frozen, more containers can be placed within the freezer in the unfolded configuration than would otherwise be able to be placed in the freezer when the containers are assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in the schematic side view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the lid <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, base <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>, and/or one or more of the sidewalls <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> of a container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can include protrusions <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> that extend outwardly from an exterior surface <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. These protrusions can be used to form air flow channels <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> between the containers and the surface <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> upon which it is placed. Clearly, the number and arrangement of protrusions can vary among embodiments. Preferably, the protrusions are arranged in rows that are spaced parallel from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, two containers (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>B) are shown stacked one upon the other. In this arrangement, air (depicted by arrows) is able to flow between the containers, as well as between the lowermost container and surface <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, embodiments of containers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also can incorporate recesses <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, which are complimentary shaped with respect to the protrusions <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>. Thus, the containers (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>C, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>D) can nest within each other. Stacking the containers in a nested configuration enables the containers to take up less space, such as during shipping when they are not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the sidewalls can incorporate mating components that are adapted to mate with each other to form a more rigid assembly and/or complete seal about the storage chamber. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, sidewall <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> includes a protruding member <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>, while sidewall <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> includes a complimentary shaped recess <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight>. The protruding member is received by the recess as the sidewalls are assembled, such as by moving sidewall <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by the arrow receiving the protruding member. In some embodiments, the protruding member and recess can include surfaces for forming an interference fit when the protruding member is inserted within the recess. Thus, by inserting the protruding member within the recess and forming the interference fit, a tendency for the sidewalls to separate from each other during use can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a storage container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, storage container <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> defines an interior <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> within which items (not shown) can be placed. Temperature-maintaining material can be placed at various locations of the storage container. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, temperature-maintaining material <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> is located at a bottom of the container, temperature-maintaining material <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> is located at the top of the container, temperature-maintaining material <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> is located at a first side of the container and temperature-maintaining <highlight><bold>493</bold></highlight> is located at a second side of the container. Also depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is temperature-maintaining material <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> that is placed within the interior <highlight><bold>488</bold></highlight> and which, preferably, is not secured to the container. In particular, temperature-maintaining material <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> is stored within a container <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight> that can be a bag or other structure that substantially retains the temperature-maintaining material. Typically, the container <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight> is enabled to be moved about the interior although, in some embodiments, the container may be adapted to be maintained in a particular position within the interior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Clearly, in other embodiments, temperature-maintaining material can be placed in one or more of the positions identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. Note, the shape, size and/or thickness of the temperature-maintaining material can differ between embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Various materials can be used for forming embodiments of containers in accordance with the invention. By way of example, insulation that is incorporated into and/or forms the walls, top and/or bottom of a container can be formed, at least partially, of urethane and/or soyoyl polyol. Of particular interest is the use of soyoyl polyol, as this material is biodegradable. Thus, biodegradable containers that are suitable for one-time use can be provided. In some of these embodiments, an outer shell can be used. For instance, a biodegradable material such as cardboard could be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the material used to form the insulation of a container also can be used to form an outer shell. In particular, various materials that form outer skins or hardened layers can be used. By way of example, ureas, e.g., urea polymers and/or copolymers, can be used to form insulated structures that incorporate hardened outer surfaces. These hardened outer surfaces of skins typically form as the material contacts the form into which the material is placed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Various types of temperature-maintaining materials also can be used. By way of example, acrylate-based superabsorbents can be used. For instance, polacrylate/polyalcohol polymers and/or copolymers, such as AP85-38 manufactured by Emerging Technologies, Inc. of Greensboro, N.C., Norsocryl D-60, LiquiBlock, AT-03S, LiquiBlock 88, LiquiBlock 75, LiquiBlock 44-OC, among others can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As described before, temperature-maintaining material can be incorporated into a container in various manners, such as by disposing the material between adjacent walls of the container and/or providing the temperature-maintaining materials in a package that can be placed within the interior of the container. Note, in use, the polymers/copolymers are allowed to absorb liquid, such as water, and the temperature of the temperature-maintaining materials can be adjusted as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As mentioned before, containers of the invention can be used for storing items, while maintaining, increasing or decreasing the temperature of the items stored in the containers. The various functions associated with the containers of the invention will now be described with respect to several flowcharts. In this regard, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a flowchart depicting a method in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, the method may be construed as beginning at block <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, where an embodiment of a container of the invention is provided. In block <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, an item is placed in the container. In block <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, the container with the item inserted therein can be transported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Various items can be stored and/or transported within containers of the invention. For instance, food products, beverages, pharmaceutical products, and biological matter, such as plants, tissues, organs, and blood can be stored and/or transported within the containers. Clearly, various other items could be used with embodiments of the invention, particularly those items that may require their respective temperatures to be maintained, reduced and/or increased for a period of time, such as during transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, another method in accordance with the invention may be construed beginning at block <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, where a container is provided. In block <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, the temperature-maintaining material of the container is adjusted to exhibit a selected temperature. By way of example, when the temperature-maintaining material is a refreezable material, the material can be frozen. In block <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, an item is placed within the container and, thereafter (block <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>), the container with the item stored therein is transported. In block <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, the item is removed from the container, such as by accessing the storage chamber and removing the item from the storage chamber. Based upon the configuration of the container and the time the item has been stored within the container, the item preferably exhibits desired temperature characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Another method of the invention is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>.
