<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a new control, sound and operating system for model toys and vehicles, and in particular for model train and railroad systems. The present invention contains a number of inventive features for model trains as well, including new coupler and smoke unit designs. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Model trains have had a long and illustrious history. From the earliest model trains to the present, one of the primary goals of model train system designers has been to make the model train experience as realistic as possible for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The typical model train has an electric motor inside the train that operates from a voltage source. The voltage is sent down the model tracks where it is picked up by the train&apos;s wheels and rollers, then transferred to the motor. A power source supplies the power to the tracks. The power source can control both the amount (amplitude) and polarity (direction) of the voltage, so that the user may control both the speed and direction of the train. Some systems use a DC voltage applied to the track. In others, the voltage is an AC voltage, and is usually the 60 Hz AC voltage available from standard U.S. wall outlets. In these systems, a transformer is necessary to reduce the amount of voltage provided to the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Using the above-described system, an early method of operating model trains is now referred to as &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; mode. As the user increases or decreases the amount of voltage applied to the track through manipulation of a throttle on the power source, the train will gain or lose speed as it travels along the track. This is a straightforward operation whereby the user directly controls the amount of voltage applied to the train&apos;s motor. Such a mode of operation requires the user to constantly monitor and adjust the amount of voltage applied to the tracks. For example, a train approaching a curve in the track may de-rail if the train is moving too fast. The user must therefore reduce the amount of voltage received by the train&apos;s motor by cutting back on the power source throttle prior to the train reaching the curve. Similar situations may occur elsewhere on the track layout, such as when the train approaches an upgrade (which may require the user to increase the amount of voltage applied) or when the train is attached to a heavy load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to being able to control the speed and direction of model trains, early train systems enabled the user to operate a whistle (or horn) and later a bell located on the train. In AC-powered systems, this was done by applying a DC offset voltage superimposed on the AC voltage applied to the track. In later systems, the train had circuitry that distinguished between the polarities of the DC offset voltage. Thus, for example, the whistle (or horn) would blow when a &plus;DC offset voltage was applied to the track, and the bell would ring when a &minus;DC offset voltage was applied. Typically, the user would press a &ldquo;horn&rdquo; or &ldquo;bell&rdquo; button located on the power source to effect the desired sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It should be apparent that the above-described system provided the user with only limited control over the operation of the train, and further required constant manual manipulation of the power source in order to maintain the train on the track layout. Later-developed systems therefore attempted to address these shortcomings and thereby increase the realism of the model train experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Two examples of such systems include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,251,856 to Young et al., and Marklin&apos;s Digital line of model trains. These systems enabled the user to have remote control operation of the train. This was accomplished by inserting a control unit between the power source and the tracks. The control unit responded to commands entered by the user on a hand-held remote control. These types of systems generally utilized microprocessor technology. A microprocessor or receiver located in the model trains would have a unique digital address associated with it. The user would enter the train&apos;s address and a command for the train on the remote control, such as &ldquo;stop,&rdquo; &ldquo;blow whistle,&rdquo; &ldquo;change direction,&rdquo; and so on. The address and commands would be implemented as infra-red (IR) or radio frequency (RF) signals. The control unit would receive the commands and pass the commands through the tracks in digital form, where the model train corresponding to the entered address would pick up the command. The microprocessor inside the model train would then execute the entered command. For example, if the user had entered a command such as &ldquo;turn on train light,&rdquo; the microprocessor would send a signal to the light driver circuit located inside the train, and the light driver circuit would turn on the light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,251,856, the user is able to control the speed of the train through the remote control. This is accomplished through the use of a triac switch located inside the control unit. The power source is set to a maximum desired level. In response to input from the user, the triac switch inside the control unit switches the AC waveform from the power source at appropriate times to control the AC power level and impose a DC offset. The speed of the trains will then change in accordance with the change in power applied to the track. The aforementioned Marklin system, on the other hand, controls the speed of the trains by use of pulse width modulation (PWM) and fullwave rectifier circuits located inside the train. The duty factor of the output signal from the PWM circuit varies between 0 and {fraction (15/16)} at a frequency that is {fraction (1/16)} of a counter frequency that remains constant. This allows the user a 16-step speed control for each train. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Many other advances have been made in model trains beyond those described here. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,914,431 to Severson et al. describes the use of a state machine in the train that increases the number of control signals available to the user for control over train features such as sound volume, couplers, directional state, and various sound features. U.S. Pat. No. 5,448,142 discloses, among other things, ways to improve the quality and realism of sounds made by the train during operation. Still, further advances in the area of model trains are desirable, in order to approach the desired goal of realism during operation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a model train operating, sound and control system that provides a user with operating realism beyond that found in prior art systems. The present invention provides a number of new and useful features in order to achieve this goal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One feature of the present invention is a novel two-way remote control communication capability between the user and the model trains. This feature is accomplished by using a handheld remote control on which various commands may be entered, and a Track Interface Unit that retrieves and processes the commands. The Track Interface Unit converts the commands to modulated signals (preferably spread spectrum signals) which are sent down the track rails. The model train picks up the modulated signals, retrieves the entered command, and executes it through use of a processor and associated control and driver circuitry. The process may also be reversed, so that operating information regarding the train is provided back to the user for display on the remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the present invention is a speed control circuit located on the printed circuit board inside the model train that is capable of continuously monitoring the operating speed of the train and making adjustments to a motor drive circuit. Through this circuit, precise and accurate scale miles-per-hour speed may be continuously maintained by the model train, even as the train goes up and down hills or around curves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Still another feature of the present invention is the ability to connect the Track Interface Unit to an external source, such as a computer, CD player, or other sound source, and have real-time sounds stream down the model train tracks for playing through the speakers located in the model train. This feature enables a user to actually have a song or other recorded sound &ldquo;played&rdquo; by the model train as it travels around the tracks. A microphone embodiment is also disclosed, whereby the user&apos;s voice may be played out through the model train speakers in real time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the present invention is a new coupler design and circuit that enables the activation of electric couplers to be achieved at very low voltage. This feature allows coupler firing in the model train environment to more closely match the operating conditions of couplers on real trains. This is particularly important when operating in &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; mode, where low voltage is directly related to low speed, thereby providing more realistic operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Yet another feature of the present invention is a smoke unit circuit design that allows smoke (or steam) output to be controlled by the user. In this way, smoke and steam output from the model train can be synchronized to match the operating condition of the train. For example, as the train picks up speed, the amount of smoke or steam output would increase accordingly. Or, if the load on the train increases, a larger amount of smoke will be outputted indicative of the additional power required to move the train. In addition, the smoke puffs let out by the train can be synchronized with the rotation of the wheels and thereby reflect train speed. For example, the smoke unit circuit can be controlled so that each &frac14; rotation of the train wheels will result in one smoke &ldquo;puff&rdquo;. Also, the smoke unit circuit can be controlled to &ldquo;stream&rdquo; smoke continuously, even at zero velocity, as do real-life steamer-type trains. Even further, the volume of smoke output can be automatic in relation to train conditions, or it can be manually controlled by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Many other features are described herein. For example, sounds may be synchronized to the model train operation, such as engine &ldquo;chuff&rdquo; sounds. The present invention provides the capability of the model train simulating the Doppler effect as the train approaches and passes by. A series of operating commands may be recorded by the user for precise play-back at another time. Customized sounds may be recorded so that users can have the model train play their own unique sounds. Sounds and information may be downloaded (and uploaded) through the Internet via a computer or information appliance hookup to the TIU (additional examples include telephones, PDAs, or other devices capable of providing information). Many different accessories (track lights, track switches, crossing gates, etc.) may be controlled by the user on the remote control through use of an Accessory Interface Unit, also described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The complete invention is described below, and in the corresponding claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a control system that allows the user to operate multiple trains on the same track and under independent operating instructions. The present invention also allows a user to operate different trains on the same track in different modes of operation. For example, a user may operate one or more trains in &ldquo;command&rdquo; mode, which refers to the present invention&apos;s use of digital signals to operate the model train equipped with the inventive features described herein. At the same time, a user may operate one or more trains on the track in the aforementioned &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; mode. Finally, other trains on the track may operate in &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; mode, which is similar to legacy mode but which takes advantage of certain features of the present invention to improve the operation of the train. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Overview </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the basic components of the control system of the present invention. The track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is coupled to a Track Interface Unit (TIU) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which in turn is coupled to an Accessory Interface Unit (AIU) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The AIU is connected to any number of train layout accessories (shown generically as Accessories <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to a power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which may be any type of AC or DC voltage source, such as a transformer. In this embodiment, the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provides AC voltage and is plugged into a standard wall outlet (not shown). Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a hand-held remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The user inputs commands on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in order to control the operation of the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The command mode of operation will be explained next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In command mode, the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the track ignore the voltage that is applied to the tracks with respect to speed settings. Instead, the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> respond only to digital speed command signals entered by the user. In command mode, therefore, the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is typically set to approximately maximum voltage and left there. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The user enters the desired commands on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. These commands are relayed to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by RF signals in the preferred embodiment, although it should be understood that any form of wireless transmission, including IR signaling, would also be acceptable. The TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has circuitry (explained more fully below) that receives the RF signals containing the commands, and other circuitry that converts the signals into modulated signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The present invention utilizes &ldquo;spread spectrum&rdquo; signaling as the preferred mode of communicating commands from the user to the model train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Other modulation types are also acceptable and considered to be within the scope of the present invention. Spread spectrum signalling, however, has been determined to be the preferred method. Generally, in spread spectrum signaling, the signal is coded and the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is made larger than the minimum bandwidth required to transmit the information being sent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Spread spectrum signaling is desirable in the present context because model train layouts generally are a noisy operating environment. When a narrow bandwidth is used to transmit a signal, there is the possibility that, due to noise, fading, or other interference, and the signal will be lost. Spread spectrum signaling substantially eliminates this risk. The details of the spread spectrum signalling used in the present invention will be described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For illustrative purposes, the rest of the description herein will refer to spread spectrum signalling when referring to the communication method employed. It is contemplated, however, that other modulation methods could also be used, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Returning to the description of the command mode of operation, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> transmits the spread spectrum signals out over the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. in other words, the signals are actually passed down the rail(s) of the track. The TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also provides power to the tracks from the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, both track power (in the form of AC voltage) and the commands are sent out by the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the track rail(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have an engine board inside that contains a microprocessor and other circuitry, as will be described below. In simplest terms, the engine board in the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will receive the spread spectrum signals from the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and execute any commands addressed to it. The train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> then performs the command entered by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In command mode, each model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a unique digital address associated with it (along with a &ldquo;universal address&rdquo; that, if inputted, would send the command to all the trains). The user enters the address on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the command that the user desires that particular train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to perform. Only the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whose address has been entered will respond to the command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Through this arrangement, multiple trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be independently controlled and operated by the user through use of the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As a non-limiting example, a user may command train &num;1 to accelerate to a desired speed and turn on its lights; command train &num;2 to announce its impending arrival at the next station and to stop at that station; and command train &num;3 to reverse direction, slow down and fire its coupler in order to prepare to connect to a box car consist. The present invention allows for all three trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to execute their respective commands independently of each other, while a constant AC voltage is applied to the track. Two or more trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can function on the same track, at different speeds, even though the track voltage is the same and is controlled by the single power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Users can also operate one or more trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in conventional mode. In this mode, the user varies the track voltage by manipulating the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (either manually or by remote control). A train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> operating in conventional mode will respond to the change in track voltage by slowing down or speeding up. If more than one train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is operating in conventional mode, each will respond at the same time to the variance in track voltage being applied by the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, independent operation of trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in conventional mode is not possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> However, the present invention allows the user to have one or more trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> operating in command mode and one or more trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> operating in conventional mode on the same track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Those train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> equipped with the novel engine board shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will operate in command mode if the user so desires as described above in response to commands entered by the user on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Those train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> operating in conventional mode will respond to changes in the track voltage effected by the user through the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in command mode will continue to execute the commands entered by the user without regard for the change in track voltage (subject to operational limits), and the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in conventional mode will respond only to changes in track voltage, oblivious to the spread spectrum signals applied to the tracks for the command mode train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This allows older trains and trains of different manufacturers to operate alongside the inventive train disclosed herein on the same track layout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows one embodiment of the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in more detail. It should be understood that the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is merely exemplary, and any number of different remote control functions/designs may be used. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has an LCD display <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, a thumb-wheel <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, and various push buttons <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The user enters commands by pressing a particular push-button <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (or a predetermined series of push-buttons <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>) dedicated to a particular command, or by using the thumb-wheel <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> to scroll through a menu that appears on the LCD display <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to select the desired command. The remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably battery operated and is controlled by a processor <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. One acceptable processor <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> is part number M30624FGLFP sold by Mitsubishi. It should be understood that other processors or hard-wired circuitry could be used. The remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also has a wireless transmitter, such as the illustrated RF transceiver <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and antenna <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> in the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> monitors the inputs from the user and from the RF antenna <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> for any changes and updates the display accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As previously stated, the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> communicates with the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. When the remote control processor <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> is required to send a command to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it does so through the RF transceiver <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the RF transceiver <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> operates in approximately the 900 MHz band using &ldquo;ook&rdquo; (on/off keying) modulation, although it would be recognized by those of skill in the art that other methods of communication could be used. The processor <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, via the transceiver <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, sends an RF signal that contains the command entered by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a transceiver <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that communicates with the transceiver <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and antenna <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> located in the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thus, in one embodiment the transceiver <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is a 900 MHz band 9600 baud ook transceiver, although it should be understood that other transceiver configurations could be used. Further, an IR receiver could be used if the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is transmitting IR signals, or any other wireless transceiver may also be acceptable depending on the wireless communication scheme implemented by the manufacturer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The transceiver <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> receives the RF signal containing the command issued from the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The transceiver <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> passes the RF signal to a processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> that controls the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. One suitable processor is part number M30624FGLFP manufactured by Mitsubishi, although other processors are also acceptable. The processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> decodes the command from the RF signal and issues an &ldquo;acknowledgment packet&rdquo; to the transceiver <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for communication back to the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The acknowledgment packet is used to inform the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that the command was successfully received by the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> in the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extracts the command from the RF signal and passes it to the communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> for conversion into spread spectrum format (as described below). The communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> then passes the spread spectrum signal to a transmitter <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> for outputting the spread spectrum signal to the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via conventional wiring. The spread spectrum signal is mixed with the AC voltage provided to the tracks from the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. It is contemplated that the processor may be capable of generating the spread spectrum signalling itself (such as a &ldquo;system on a chip&rdquo;), and in such an embodiment the communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> would not be necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, it is possible for the user to communicate commands to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through use of a computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through a standard RS232 port <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (or other suitable data port) and cable <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The commands normally entered on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are entered through a computer program executed by the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The ability to write such a program is well within the expertise of a person of ordinary skill in the art of computer programming, and therefore no description of such a program is required herein. In the computer embodiment, the operation of the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and other elements of the invention remains the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The model train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be described next with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> installed inside, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in block diagram form. The printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at the center of the model train&apos;s operations. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is connected to a receiver circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> that picks the spread spectrum signals off from the train track rails in the preferred embodiment. The receiver circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> passes the spread spectrum signals to a communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, correlates the spread spectrum signals into a fixed data pattern that is capable of being recognized by the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. When correlation is achieved, the data pattern is outputted by the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In an alternate embodiment, it is contemplated that the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is capable of converting the spread spectrum signals itself, and/or is able to detect the command data from the spread spectrum signals (for example, a system on a chip). In these embodiments, the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, upon receiving the data pattern containing the command, outputs an acknowledge signal to the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> converts the acknowledge signal to spread spectrum format and outputs the acknowledge spread spectrum signal to a transmitter circuit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> outputs an acknowledge signal in spread spectrum format itself directly to the transmitter circuit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. In this alternate embodiment, the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is once again not necessary. In either embodiment, the transmitter circuit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> places the acknowledge spread spectrum signal on the train track rails, where it is picked up by the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The TIU processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> then converts the acknowledge spread spectrum signal into an RF signal, which the TIU transceiver <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> outputs to the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In this way, there is &ldquo;handshake&rdquo; capability between the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, model train printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The reason for such bi-directional capability is that it allows the data about the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be received by the user. Such data may include, but is not limited to, the type of train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (diesel or steam), the digital address of the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, consist information, the actual speed of the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the types and amount of lights, whether there is a smoke unit present, the types of couplers, the various sound capabilities, the amount of memory available for sounds, the amount of voltage, current, and power the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is using, and other such information. Thus, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> maintain all necessary, relevant information concerning the model train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and their operation during use. This information is available to the user in order to enhance the user&apos;s enjoyment and realistic operation of the model train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Spread Spectrum Signalling </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A description of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, wherein commands are transmitted by the user to the model train through spread spectrum signalling, will now be described. It should be understood that the following description describes one method of employing spread spectrum signalling. Other methods of spread spectrum signalling may also be used, and are considered within the scope of the present invention. The following description should therefore be considered illustrative, not limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The present invention, in its preferred embodiment, uses spread spectrum signalling because model trains generally operate in a &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; electrical environment. Spread spectrum signalling utilizes an increased bandwidth technique in order to protect the integrity of the original signal and prevent the original signal from being distorted or changed by electric noise in the operating environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The operation is as follows. The user enters a command on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be carried out by the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The command is transmitted by the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through radio frequency signals (or, in alternate embodiments, any other type of wireless transmission) to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The transceiver <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receives the command and passes it to the processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> converts the command into a data transfer packet which contains a data stream representing the command. Each command will be prefaced with a preamble (typically one byte long) that is a fixed series of digital &ldquo;1&rdquo;s and &ldquo;0&rdquo;s. The preamble is used to achieve code and bit synchronization prior to receiving data. The data stream is therefore a series of digital bits (&ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;0&rdquo;). A typical command may comprise 4 to 8 bytes of data. During streaming sound operation (described in detail below), the typical sound packet may be much larger, on the order of 32 bytes. It should be understood, however, that the present invention comprehends and encompasses within the claims hereto commands of any size and length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The data transfer packet is then passed by the processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to the communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is used in the preferred embodiment to transmit and receive spread spectrum signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> receives the data transfer packet and converts each databit in the data transfer packet into 31 &ldquo;chips.&rdquo; Thus, the chipping rate is 31 times the data rate. The chips make up a pseudo-noise (P-N) code. The P-N code is a series of 31 &ldquo;1&rdquo;s and &ldquo;0&rdquo;s. The P-N code is fixed and does not change. Thus, each databit &ldquo;1&rdquo; in the data transfer packet is converted into the same 31-bit P-N code. The databit &ldquo;0&rdquo;s are converted into the P-N code in inverted fashion; that is, if the first four chips of the P-N code are 0-1-1-0, for example, the first four chips of the P-N code inverted are 1-0-0-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A simple four-byte command, 32 data bits, in the data transfer packet is therefore converted into 992 chips, which means that it takes 992 chip times for a 4-byte command to be output by the communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the chipping rate is 3.75 MHz. The actual data rate is thus 3.75 MHz divided by 31, or 121 KHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> passes the P-N codes to a transceiver <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> (the transceiver may be a part of the communication circuit or a separate element) that continually outputs the P-N codes representing the databits in the data transfer packet. This process continues until the data transfer packet has been sent. At that point, the transceiver <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is turned off, and no further P-N codes are transmitted. The P-N codes are coupled to the track <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in streaming fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description represents the &ldquo;transmitting&rdquo; side of the spread spectrum signalling embodiment. What follows is a description of the &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; side. The receiver circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) located inside the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> picks up the P-N codes from the track. The receiver circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> passes the P-N codes to the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Inside the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is a 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). As the P-N codes come into the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> at the chipping rate of 3.75 MHz, they are shifted through the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Parallel to the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>, there is a 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> that is permanently loaded with the original 31 bit P-N code in normal, noninverted fashion. (The 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> can be any structure capable of permanently retaining the P-N code, such as another, fixed 31 bit shift register or a suitable hard-wired configuration). Between the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> and the 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> are a series of exclusive-or (XOR) gates (collectively labelled <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight>). The inputs to the first XOR gate are the first stage of the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> and the first stage of the 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight>. The inputs to the second XOR gate are the second stage of the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> and the second stage of the 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight>, and so on. The XOR gates output a &ldquo;1&rdquo; when the inputs are different, and output a &ldquo;0&rdquo; when the inputs are the same. There are 31 XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight>, corresponding to the 31 bits in each of the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> and the 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> An adder <highlight><bold>2028</bold></highlight> is connected to the 31 XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight>. The adder <highlight><bold>2028</bold></highlight> counts the outputs of the XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight> in order to determine how many of the outputs from the XOR gates were &ldquo;0&rdquo;. The output from the adder <highlight><bold>2028</bold></highlight> is therefore a number from 0 to 31; for example, if the output from the adder is 14, the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> knows that the output at 14 of the XOR gates was &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As the data is clocked through the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>, the outputs from the XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight> will change with each clock pulse. Accordingly, the output from the adder <highlight><bold>2028</bold></highlight> will also change. When the P-N codes in the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> match the P-N codes in the 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight>, the outputs of the XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight> will all be &ldquo;0&rdquo; and the output of the adder <highlight><bold>2028</bold></highlight> will therefore be 31. At this point, the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> determines that the incoming data is correlated, i.e., the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is now synchronized with the incoming data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> now knows that every 31st clock pulse will be a databit in the original data transfer packet. The communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> thereafter samples the output of the adder <highlight><bold>2028</bold></highlight> at every 31st clock pulse after correlation. This is done by summing the outputs of the XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight>. If the total is 16 or greater, the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> determines that the original databit in the data transfer packet was a &ldquo;0&rdquo;. If the total of the outputs from the XOR gates is 15 or less, the communication circuit determines that the original databit was a &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The reasoning for this is as follows: the P-N code loaded into the 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> corresponds to a databit &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The more matches there are between the P-N codes passing through the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> and the 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight>, the more likely it is that the original databit was a &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Because a match at the inputs of the XOR gates results in the XOR gate outputting a zero, if the P-N codes in the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> exactly match the P-N code in the 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight>, the outputs of all <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> XOR gates will be zero and the sum of the outputs of the XOR gates will also be zero. The communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> would therefore know that the original databit representing a portion of the command was a &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Thus, a majority of matches from the XOR gates results in a total sum of the outputs being 15 or less. The communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> interprets that result to be a databit &ldquo;1&rdquo;. A minority of matches, in contrast, results in the total sum of the outputs of the XOR gates being 16 or higher, which the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> will determine to be a databit &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In this fashion, the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> constructs the original information in the data transfer packet in binary form. When the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> reads a series of &ldquo;1&rdquo;s and &ldquo;0&rdquo;s that corresponds to the preamble, the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> then knows that the remaining &ldquo;1&rdquo;s and &ldquo;0&rdquo;s represent the command entered by the user. The communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> provides the command to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> thereafter takes whatever action is necessary that corresponds to the command (as discussed in more detail below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of the spread spectrum signalling embodiment represents the ideal case. In actual practice, there is noise on the rails and in the operating environment that can distort or change the values of the P-N codes. Recognizing that digital &ldquo;1&rdquo;s and &ldquo;0&rdquo;s are actually simply some voltage value, it is common for electrical noise to change the voltage value of a binary signal to the point that it is indeterminant or false, that is, opposite of what it should be. Moreover, in the real world environment there are not instantaneous changes from 1 to 0. Instead, there is a transition region from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1 wherein the value is indeterminant. Sampling a signal during the transition region can result in faulty data. The end result with respect to all these problems is that the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may believe it is synchronized when in fact it is not, or it may not detect synchronization. Obviously, this is undesirable, as it can result in the entered command not being performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To overcome this problem, the preferred embodiment of the present invention takes several precautions. First, the threshold for determining correlation between the P-N codes in the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> and the 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> is set to less than 31; a non-limiting example may be 28. Thus, if the outputs of the XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight> are such that at least 28 of the P-N codes in the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> match the P-N code in the 31 bit memory <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight>, the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> will consider itself synchronized to the incoming data stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Another problem that must be overcome concerns the clock rate. The phase of the clock signal is not known by the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In other words, data (PN codes) could be shifting into the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight> right when the P-N codes are in a transition region as described above. In the transition region, the data is in effect undefined. Therefore, there is the possibility that undefined data is being sampled out of the 31 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In order to solve this problem, the 31 bit shift register in the ideal case is replaced with a 62 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>&prime; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) that operates at twice the chipping rate; i.e., data is shifted into the 62 bit register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>&prime; at a rate of 7.5 MHz. This in effect means that for any given stage in the 62 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>&prime;, the next stage is 180 degrees out of phase. By this arrangement, if data is being clocked into one stage of the 62 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>&prime; during transition, the same data will be clocked into the next stage when it is stable. The 62 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>&prime; therefore functions like two 31 bit shift registers: stages 1, 3, 5, . . . 61 of the 62 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>&prime; act like one 31 bit shift register, and stages 2, 4, 6, . . . 62 act like another 31 bit shift register that is 180 degrees out of phase with the first. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The 62 bit shift register <highlight><bold>2022</bold></highlight>&prime; is wired to the 31 XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight> as explained above, except that only odd shift register outputs are used and the XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight> provide an output at twice the rate of that described in the ideal condition. The outputs of the XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight> are monitored by the adder <highlight><bold>2028</bold></highlight> to determine when the predetermined number (in the above example, 28) of matches occurs in order to determine synchronization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In operation then, the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> will therefore determine when syncronization occurs by looking for 28 out of 31 matches. It should be apparent that when synchronization occurs, the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> thereafter monitors the outputs of the XOR gates <highlight><bold>2026</bold></highlight> after 62 clock cycles of the 7.5 MHz clock. The procedure then is the same as described in the ideal case for clocking in the remainder of the data and determining the original command entered by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The communication circuits <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the engine board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> respectively are capable of both receiving and transmitting spread spectrum signals in the above fashion. Therefore, once the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> determines what the command is, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> assembles an acknowledge packet, which is intended to provide the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with an indication that the command has been received. The acknowledge packet is sent to the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for conversion into spread spectrum format as just described. This is then sent through the rails back to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> where it is received and detected by the transceiver <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> in the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The acknowledge spread spectrum signal is decoded as explained above and the acknowledge signal is passed to the TIU processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. In this manner, all components of the model train system are aware of the operating conditions of the model train at all times. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and the description of the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> controls and drives the various component circuits located on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> drives the operation of the lights located on the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the light driver circuit <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The smoke system is operated by the smoke system driver circuit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> under command of the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The couplers are controlled by the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> via the coupler drive circuit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The train&apos;s motor is controlled by the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through the motor control <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. The sound system is controlled by the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through an audio amplifier/low pass filter circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&prime;, which is connected to a speaker <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&Prime; (collectively, the &ldquo;sound system circuit&rdquo; <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Certain sounds for the model train may be stored in a flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, which in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> embodiment is connected to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is capable of retrieving one or more sound files from the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, processing them, and outputting them to the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In an alternate embodiment, such as a system on a chip configuration, the sound files are stored on the same integrated circuit as the processor. The sound files may be output from the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through a pulse width modulation (PWM) circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; found in the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, or by a digital to analog converter circuit (DAC) <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime;. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is capable of manipulating the sound file data in order to generate various sound effects, such as Doppler, as will be explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is also capable of independently controlling the volume of different processed sounds, in response to commands entered from the user on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The user can also control a &ldquo;master&rdquo; volume control by having the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> adjust the DC voltage level of the audio amplifier <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&prime; found in the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the master volume may be controlled by the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> limiting the pulse output level of the PWM circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime;. This allows the user to adjust the volume of different sounds independently, and adjust the volume of the sounds as a whole. The user can also cut all sounds by turning the master volume to its minimum level. It is also desirable for the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to have a battery backup or capacitors (not shown) in order to allow the sounds to continue for a fixed amount of time even after the power has been removed from the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the invention, a user may want the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to continually play a &ldquo;chuffing&rdquo; sound when the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is in motion. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will repeatedly retrieve the &ldquo;chuff&rdquo; sound file from the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, process it, and feed it to the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the user may want the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to play station and status announcements (for example, &ldquo;now arriving at Union Station;&rdquo; &ldquo;we are currently 60 miles from Baltimore,&rdquo; etc.). The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will retrieve the appropriate sound files, as described above. The user may also want the train whistle to blow every 15 seconds. Once again, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will retrieve the sound files. All these sounds will play, at the same time, through the speaker <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&Prime; in the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> At some point, however, the user may wish to lower the volume of the &ldquo;chuff&rdquo; sound in order to better hear the station announcements. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is capable of reducing the volume of the chuff sound and increasing the volume of the station announcement sounds, while maintaining the volume of the whistle sound. Finally, the user may desire to lower the volume of all the sounds simultaneously, which the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> accomplishes through the master volume control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As previously stated with respect to the above-described embodiment, sounds are stored in the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the model train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. It is also possible that sounds are stored in a flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> located in the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). In this way, once a user requests a sound on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the TIU processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> retrieves the appropriate sound file from the TIU flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, relays it to the communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> for conversion to a spread spectrum signal, and sends it down the train track rails. The addressed model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> picks up the signal through the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and passes it to the communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in order to retrieve the sound file embedded in the spread spectrum signal. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> processes the sound file outputs it to the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">External Audio Feature </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Although history has shown that the storage capacity of memory chips increases steadily as fabrication technology improves, there will always be a finite amount of memory available when an application requires resident file storage. For example, in the present embodiment, there will always be a limit on the amount of sound files that can be stored &ldquo;on board&rdquo; the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or in the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The present invention addresses this issue by allowing a user to connect the model train system to an external audio source. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to an external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through standard left and right stereo jacks <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> or other suitable connections. The external source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be a CD player, DVD player, cassette player, mini-disc player, memory stick, mp3 player, or other sound source. Because the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is also capable of communicating with a computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as explained above, the external source here may also be a computer&apos;s hard drive or an open modem connection to the Internet via the computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> When the user desires to play the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, he or she enters an appropriate command on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which informs the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that it will be receiving sounds from the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The TIU processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> then sends a command to the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to stop playing any sounds previously commanded by the user. The model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> receives the &ldquo;stop&rdquo; command and stops playing all stored sounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Once the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is activated, the sounds &ldquo;stream&rdquo; from the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, where the sounds are heard emanating from the speaker <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&Prime; on board the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this way, the user will interpret &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; sounds coming from the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> This is accomplished through the use of the aforementioned spread spectrum signals. The spread spectrum signal is capable of carrying large amounts of data, such as continuously played sounds from the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the rate at which data is passed from the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the tracks in the form of spread spectrum signals is very high (the aforementioned example being approximately 121 KHz). This high data rate also allows for real-time sound to be sent down the tracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The sounds enter the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as line level audio via the aforementioned left and right stereo jacks <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> or other connections. The TIU processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> samples the sounds and converts them into digital data (by a standard A/D converter, not shown), which is passed to the communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> then embeds the digital sound data into a spread spectrum signal which is sent out to the train track rails as previously described. The model train receiver circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> picks up the spread spectrum signal, and passes it to the train communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, which decodes the digital sound data from the spread spectrum signal. The communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> passes the digital sound data to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The train processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> then converts the digital sound data into analog form through a DAC and passes the analog signal to the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, which plays the analog sound through the speaker <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&Prime;. This process repeats itself at a high enough rate that the user hears continuous sounds playing from the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the sounds from the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are converted into ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) format at a rate of 4 bits/sample and 11,000 samples/second. This requires a data rate from the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the train track rails of at least 44,000 bits/second. The aforementioned illustrative data rate of 121 KHz meets this requirement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The left and right stereo sounds received by the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the left and right stereo jacks <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are added by the TIU processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and output to the tracks in mono form. As described previously, the user can adjust the master volume of the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in order to increase or decrease the volume of the sound output by the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> It should be apparent that the present invention provides the user with a number of exciting options. For example, the user may connect the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a CD player and have the model train &ldquo;play&rdquo; the user&apos;s favorite songs. The user may have a unique pattern of train sounds specifically created by the user and stored on the user&apos;s computer hard-drive. This invention enables the user to play his or her customized &ldquo;train sound track&rdquo; through a model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The system disclosed herein provides other sound possibilities. For example, the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be a microphone. Following the same steps as described above, the user may speak into the microphone and have his or her own voice transmitted down the train track rails by the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (via spread spectrum signals), where it will be converted by the train communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and played through the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> on the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In place of an external microphone, the present invention also contemplates having a microphone <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> built into the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which the user could turn on with one of the push buttons <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and then speak directly into the remote control microphone <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Through this feature of the present invention, the user can be the train &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; and announce train station stops, status updates, etc. Of course, this feature also enables the user to playfully interact with other people in the room. For example, the user may have the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> say &ldquo;happy birthday&rdquo; to someone else in the room, or have the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> call to the family dog. The possibilities are endless, and the foregoing are merely examples. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Custom Sound </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention allows users to store their own custom sound files in the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> located in the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, the custom sound files are stored in the flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> located in the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The general concepts are the same for both embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The user is capable of entering a &ldquo;record&rdquo; command on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The record command is sent via the RF signals to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which embeds the command into a spread spectrum signal and passes the command down the rails to the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The command is received and processed by the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and train processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, respectively. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> then checks the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for available capacity. Assuming there is capacity, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> creates a sound file in the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> and assigns a ID to the file. The flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> then is placed in &ldquo;record&rdquo; (or &ldquo;store&rdquo;) mode and awaits sound data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The sound data can come from any of the above-described sources identified with respect to the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, i.e., CD players, tape players, mini-disc players, mp3 players, memory sticks, computer hard-drives, Internet websites, or someone&apos;s voice via the microphone. After the user enters the &ldquo;record&rdquo; command on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the user then enters the command informing the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that sounds will be coming from the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The sounds from the external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are embedded as digital data into a spread spectrum signal by the communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The signal is passed down the train track rails where it is received by the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The train&apos;s communication circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> decode the sound digital data from the spread spectrum signal and pass it to the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, where it is stored as digital sound data in the newly created sound file. When the user enters the &ldquo;stop recording&rdquo; command on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> stops the flow of data into the sound file. In one embodiment, the sound file is recorded on the fly into the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> in the engine board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the sound file may first be stored in the flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> in the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and then transferred at a later time into the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> in the engine board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> now has a unique sound file recorded by the user. The train processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> passes the ID of the unique sound file to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in an information packet through the track rails, and the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> passes the information on to the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via RF signals. The remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can then provide the user with the ID of the newly created sound file so that the user can recall that ID on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when he or she wants the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to play the unique sound file. Alternatively, the user can assign an ID to the recorded sound file on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (for example, pressing a combination of three push buttons <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will activate the recorded sound file). The user-assigned ID is then passed along to the train processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which stores the user-assigned ID in memory and activates the recorded sound file when the user-assigned ID is entered on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the alternative embodiment, where the recorded sound file is stored in the flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> in the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the system works substantially the same way. In this embodiment, however, the TIU processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> converts the sounds to be recorded into digital data and stores them in a sound file created in the TIU flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. When the user wishes to have the recorded sound file played, the TIU processor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> retrieves it from the flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and passes it to the communication circuit <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, which embeds the digital sound data from the sound file into a spread spectrum signal. This is then output to the train track rails, where it is picked up and played by the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as has been previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> This &ldquo;recording&rdquo; feature also expands on the capabilities of the model train system for the user. For example, a user may sing &ldquo;happy birthday&rdquo; to his or her daughter and store the song in a sound file in the flash memory (<highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>). When the daughter enters the room, the user can activate the sound file and the daughter will hear the train &ldquo;sing&rdquo; happy birthday to her. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Another example concerns new train sounds. Model train makers are constantly searching for new and different sounds that simulate real-life train sounds. A manufacturer may make an upgrade available with new sound files. With the present invention, the user could purchase a CD (for example) having the new sound files, and record the new sound files from the CD to the flash memory (<highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Further, because of the present invention&apos;s capability of interacting with a computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the manufacturer may make the new sound files available for download from the manufacturer&apos;s Internet website. The user can connect the model train system to his or her computer, access the website, and download the new sound files directly into the flash memory (TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or model train) using the &ldquo;record&rdquo; feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Returning to the ability of the present invention to play streaming sounds from an external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the embodiment described above uses the spread spectrum signaling method to digitize the sound and provide it to the train processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The train processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> then converts the digitized sound to analog for playing through the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In an alternate embodiment, the present invention does not digitize the streaming sound. This may be referred to as the &ldquo;analog&rdquo; embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The setup for the analog system is similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to an external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as described above. In this embodiment, rather than converting the audio signal into digital data for embedding into a spread spectrum signal, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> uses FM modulation techniques. In one non-limiting example, the audio signal is FM modulated at a frequency of 10.7 MHz. The peak frequency deviation is about 40 KHz. This was chosen because it is similar to modulation used for FM radio when only a mono receiver is used. It should be understood, however, that other frequencies and deviations may be used, and are considered within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, it is contemplated that an FM signal transmitter <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is housed in the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has two inputs <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> for audio in, although one input is also possible, as is more than two. In the preferred embodiment of two inputs, one is line level and the other is microphone level. When an audio signal is presented at either one of these inputs, the FM signal transmitter <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is enabled. In this embodiment, there is a delay between the end of the audio signal and the disabling of the FM signal transmitter <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. This is done so that the silence between songs on a CD or other source will not cause the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to return to playing normal train sounds, such as chuffing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The FM signal transmitter <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> may be any suitable one available in the art. An acceptable FM signal transmitter <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> consists of a 10.7 MHz LC transistor oscillator, an output driver, and a coupling power source. A varactor in the FM signal transmitter <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> varies the transmitter&apos;s output frequency with changes in the audio input. The driver boosts the transmitted FM signal and the coupling power source couples the 10.7 MHz signal onto the train track rails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In the analog embodiment, an FM receiver integrated circuit (IC) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is located on the model train&apos;s printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Once the FM receiver <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> receives a 10.7 MHz signal, it signals the train processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to stop producing other sounds and the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is driven by the output of the FM receiver IC <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. This is described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The receiver circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> picks up the FM signal from the train track rails (in a three-rail system, this signal is found on the center rail). This signal is filtered in a 10.7 MHz ceramic filter <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The filtered signal is then passed to the FM receiver IC <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Any standard FM receiver IC <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> or circuit may be used for this purpose. Non-limiting examples of such ICs are the Philips SA614 and the Motorola MC3371. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The FM receiver IC <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> receives the filtered signal and amplifies it. The amplified signal is then externally filtered in another ceramic filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The second filtered signal is then passed through a limiter <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and into a discriminator <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The output of the discriminator is the audio signal. This audio signal is muted if the received 10.7 MHz signal is not strong enough. If it is sufficiently strong, the audio signal is passed to the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> where it is amplified and played through the speaker <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the FM receiver IC <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> mixes the received filtered signal down to 450 KHz. The source for the 10.24 MHz local oscillator is a crystal. The 450 KHz signal is then amplified and externally filtered in an LC filter <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. The second filtered signal then goes through a limiter <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and into the discriminator <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> where the audio signal is recovered. Once again, this audio signal is muted if the 450 KHz signal is not strong enough. If the signal is strong enough, the audio signal then goes to the audio amplifier where it drives the speaker <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&Prime; in the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Diagnostic Information </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The ability of the present invention to communicate with a computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> takes advantage of the two-way &ldquo;handshake&rdquo; capability between the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As previously stated, the train processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is capable of outputting a large amount of information concerning the status of the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This information can be &ldquo;uploaded&rdquo; from the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the Internet. Thus, a user having a problem with a particular model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can put the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the track <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and connect the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Once the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is linked to the Internet via a modem connection, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can retrieve operating information about the model train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the train processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and upload that information to a troubleshooting website, manufacturing website, dealer website, or other location. A technician at the other end can then retrieve and analyze the train information and propose solutions to any operating difficulties the user is having. It is also possible that the technician can download a software patch or other solution to the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the open modem connection, in the manner described above concerning the playing of sounds from an external audio source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a user may be able to download a software patch from a website directly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Speed Control Overview </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention, &ldquo;speed control,&rdquo; will be described next. First, some background information concerning the state of the prior art is appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a traditional speed control for a model train corresponding to the aforementioned &ldquo;legacy mode.&rdquo; A transformer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> powers the track <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with AC/DC voltage. The AC/DC voltage is then fed directly into the engine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the train. The engine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a motor drive circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The motor drive circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> receives the AC/DC voltage and applies this to the motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> directly, or indirectly such as through rectification in the case of an AC track voltage and a DC motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned setup, speed control for the train is accomplished by manual control of the output voltage supplied by the transformer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A user may manually adjust the output voltage of the transformer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, e.g., using a control knob or throttle arm, to a predetermined value which would correlate with a desired speed for the model train. Accordingly, the higher the voltage output of the transformer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the faster the train will go. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The problems associated with the &ldquo;legacy mode&rdquo; of operation will now be discussed with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> compares the output voltage of the transformer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> versus the resulting speed of the train. The transformer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be adjusted from some non-zero starting voltage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The gap between zero volts and the non-zero starting voltage <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is used as a signaling mechanism, whereby a train may interpret momentary interruptions in track voltage as a command to shift to a neutral state or to change direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the graph, the speed control of the trains in the &ldquo;legacy mode&rdquo; of operation in the prior art is dependent upon the load of the train. The two lines represent the correlation between voltage output and speed for differing loads, one for light-load and one for heavy load. When an engine is lightly loaded (e.g., few or no cars, going downhill), less voltage is required to achieve a given speed. Accordingly, with increasing load (e.g., more cars, going uphill) more voltage is required to maintain the given speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> As evident from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, train load is an important parameter for speed control. As such, a given desired speed indicated by a &ldquo;*&rdquo; on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> will require two different voltages marked on the graph as &ldquo;X&rdquo;, one voltage for low load and another voltage for high load. Accordingly, if a user desires to accurately control speeds at desired values, he/she must manually attempt to calculate and/or conduct repeated tests in order to establish a look-up table/graph that will list the required voltage for every known load. In effect, a user would have to manually produce data, similar to what is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, for every different load they will operate with. It is quickly apparent that such an undertaking would be practically impossible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the resulting data (i.e., look-up table or chart) would still not take into consideration the inherent load changes that take effect while driving the train throughout the layout. In other words, the load lines shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> are based on the assumption that load will remain fixed in value (e.g., solely dependent on number of trains, etc.). However, in practice, load will continuously change while driving the trains throughout the layout in response to certain factors related to the layout; for example, going up or down a hill or around a curve. Therefore, even if a user could produce a look-up table or chart, the user would still not be able to automatically maintain a constant speed throughout the entire layout. Additionally, it should be noted that it is typical for there to be large variations between train engines (particularly from different manufacturers). Thus, manual control of the speed of one engine will not apply to other engines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> An additional limitation of the &ldquo;legacy mode&rdquo; of operation occurs at relatively slower speeds. At a given load, only a portion of the power source&apos;s voltage range can be used to operate an engine over the desired speed range. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the load lines do not extend to a point where either the voltage or the train speed is zero. This is because the train must initially be supplied with sufficient voltage to overcome static friction between the train and the track. Once the train begins to move, the slope of the line representing the correlation of speed vs. voltage is larger as a result of the smaller amount of dynamic friction; hence, it is difficult to control the train at low speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Specifically, small manual adjustments using a power source&apos;s control knob or throttle arm cause dramatic changes in speed, thereby making it is difficult to achieve or maintain consistent slow speed operation. Moreover, a slow-moving engine stalls at curves or when climbing a hill because the supplied voltage cannot provide enough motor current to overcome the additional torque. Once stalled, the voltage must be increased to supply enough current to again overcome or break through the static friction. Additionally, in the case of lightly loaded engines, the power source voltage itself may drop out as the speed of the engine is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In summary, the &ldquo;legacy mode&rdquo; speed control in the prior art does not automatically provide a constant speed around the track regardless of static and dynamic load changes. Moreover, the prior art provides poor speed control at slow speeds, resulting in a jerk, snap-type motion when moving the trains from rest or relatively slow speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the novel speed control system of the present invention will be described in more detail. Importantly, this method can be used with existing power sources. Generally, the speed control system of the present invention comprises a feedback loop that maintains a constant desired speed of the train regardless of motor imperfections and/or load variations such as adding cars, climbing a hill or traversing a curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The motor control <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> includes a motor drive circuit <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>, a motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> and a speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight>. The motor drive circuit <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight> includes a bi-directional pulse width modulation circuit (&ldquo;PWMC&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; includes a two-transistor with relay &ldquo;H&rdquo; bridge which provides bi-directional drive to the DC motor. The bridge is pulse-width-modulated at a fixed and inaudible frequency of approximately 20 kHz. The single-ended bus voltage to the bridge is rectified from an AC track voltage. The &ldquo;H&rdquo; bridge configuration permits forward or backward drive to the motor. The &ldquo;H&rdquo; bridge is commonly used and maintaining this topology allows the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to emulate existing variable track voltage speed control systems by completely enabling the forward or reverse bridge paths without modulation. In this manner, the motor drive will be directly proportional to the rectified track voltage and will emulate the behavior of legacy systems, thereby making the SCS control easily adaptable with existing systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; functions to alter the duty cycle at which the track voltage is pulsed into the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, at any given track voltage, the PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; can control the train speed by changing the duty cycle at which the voltage is applied to the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> senses the motor speed via the speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight> and modulates the turn-on interval or duty-cycle of the &ldquo;H&rdquo; bridge transistors to modulate the current applied to the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>. With a striped speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> accumulates the transitions in a fixed control interval. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> compares the number of transitions with the commanded speed scaled to transitions per control interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> For example, if the fixed interval is 57 milliseconds, then a 10 mph scale speed would generate 40 transitions per interval using a 24-stripe sensor. The error is used to proportionally increase or decrease the duty-cycle to the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the acceleration is estimated by comparing the transition count from the present time interval to the previous time interval. This acceleration is also used to increase or decrease the duty-cycle. This implements a so-called PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control loop and can be stated algorithmically as: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The weighting multipliers are not necessarily constant and may be adjusted as a function of target speed and sign of the difference value to which they are applied. At slow motor speeds in particular, the characteristics of torque variations in brushed DC motors demand careful selection of these multipliers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; serves the important function of controlling train speed independently of the voltage across the track. For example, if the track voltage is set at 20 VAC which equates to a set scale miles per hour (&ldquo;smph&rdquo;) (up to a maximum of 100 smph), then the PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; is capable of increasing the speed of the train by increasing the duty cycle (i.e., increasing the time that the voltage is applied to the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>) for the application of the 20 VAC to the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; can reduce the speed of the train (to as little as 1 smph) by decreasing the duty cycle. The PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; thus enables the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to adjust the speed of the train over a wide range with the same track voltage. </paragraph>

Accordingly, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> sets the PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; to a fixed maximum value that remains constant regardless of the actual speed of the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> sensed by the speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Speed Control&mdash;Conventional Mode </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The general functional and operational interrelationship between the elements of the novel speed control of the present invention will now be discussed with respect to &ldquo;Conventional Mode&rdquo;. It should be noted that the following description is for exemplary purposes only and that alternative operational sequences are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> supplies a voltage across the track. The amount of voltage applied to the track is directly related to the desired speed for the train(s) on the track, as will be discussed in more detail below. The track voltage will be picked up by rollers (not shown), which also pick up the digital commands sent by the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as discussed above, on the underside of the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The track voltage is sampled by an A/D converter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> which then converts the voltage into a digital signal and outputs the digital signal to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the digital signal represents a speed command of the user. That is, the track voltage set by the user is indicative of the user&apos;s desired speed for the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (more voltage&equals;more speed). The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> utilizes the sampled track voltage to access a look-up table stored in memory that indicates what the speed of the train should be at the sampled track voltage. The looked-up speed corresponding to the sampled track voltage becomes the user&apos;s desired speed. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also receives a signal from the speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight> which is indicative of the actual train speed. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> compares the desired speed (i.e., speed command) with the actual speed and adjusts the duty cycle accordingly. The look-up table applies to all trains equipped with the present invention so that the resultant speeds are the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> An example of operation will now be discussed. To begin, a user manually adjusts the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a given voltage corresponding to a desired speed. Under normal conditions (i.e., constant load, etc.), the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will gradually reach the desired speed. However, when the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> traverses a curve or goes up/down a hill, or box cars are added, the load will change. Accordingly, the set voltage and default duty cycle will no longer be capable of maintaining the desired speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In the &ldquo;legacy mode&rdquo; of the prior art control systems discussed above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when a user set the track voltage by manually adjusting the transformer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for a desired speed, if the load on the train increased, the user had to again increase the track voltage by manually adjusting the transformer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in order to maintain the desired speed. As was seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, this resulted in a speed control system that was dependent upon the load, leading to an inefficient and impractical speed control scheme where the user must continuously adjust the track voltage to maintain a desired speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the present invention automatically provides a constant speed for the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> independently of any load changes (within limitations set by the available power supplied to the track). Consequently, once the user sets a desired speed (i.e., by manually setting a voltage), the system will maintain that speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, how the present invention automatically maintains a constant speed independently of load will now be explained. The speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight> is coupled to the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>. The speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight> is preferably a flywheel that is attached to the motor shaft (not shown) thereby rotating at the same rate as the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>, so as to measure the angular rotation of the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>. Either a reflective or transmissive optical sensing method can be employed depending on the available space in the engine housing. The reflective method uses an LED (not shown) to illuminate the flywheel which is marked with alternating reflecting and non-reflecting stripes. As the flywheel turns, a photodetector detects the rate of optical transitions thereby indicating speed. Alternatively, the transmissive method attaches a circular disk with radial stripes or spokes to either transmit or block the LED illumination. Further, the motor shaft can itself be marked similarly to the flywheel. The gear ratio for typical model engines is &frac14;&Prime; of track motion per motor revolution. For {fraction (1/48)}th scale, 1 mph is equivalent to 1.47 motor revolutions/sec. For example, if the flywheel is marked with 24 stripes or spokes, there will be 48 transitions per revolution or 70.6 photodetector transitions per scale MPH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the speed can be measured by sensing the per-revolution variation in motor current due to the self-commutation. Commutation causes an instaneous, measurable change in current (sensed as a feedback pulse) as windings move to the next brush in motors. This occurs a fixed number of times per motor revolution. Since the commutation sequence repeats with each revolution, there is a discrete number of feedback pulses per revolution, which, in essense, is an odometer. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can sense the motor current through a sense resistor (not shown) and algorithmically estimate the speed. The back-emf of the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> can optionally be simultaneously sensed to improve the estimate. The advantage of this speed sensing method is that it can be retrofitted without modifying the motor mechanical assembly; as such, it is compatible with existing motors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Another method of sensing the motor speed is the use of a magnetic hall effect sensor or switch that comprises a magnetic ring with bands of alternate polarities. The speed at which the polarities change is measured, in a manner similar to the optical flywheel described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The desired track voltage is sampled by the AND converter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and converted into a digital signal for outputting to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. This digital signal represents the desired speed. Accordingly, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is made aware of the desired speed for the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight> will continuously monitor the motor speed as an indication of the train speed and output this reading into the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will adjust the duty cycle according to a comparison that is made between the desired speed represented by the track voltage and the actual speed sensed by the speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> For example, if a user enters on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>desired speed of 10 smph, the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will output the corresponding voltage over the track (similarly, the user may manually set the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the desired voltage representing the desired speed). Accordingly, the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will gradually reach <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> smph at which point the measured speed and desired speed will have a substantially one-to-one correspondence and the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will maintain the current duty cycle. However, if, for example, the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> goes up a hill, the same track voltage will not be sufficient to maintain the desired speed because of the increase in load. As a result, the train will begin to slow down as it climbs the hill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight> will immediately sense the decrease in motor speed. Accordingly, when the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> compares the desired speed (i.e., sampled track voltage) with the actual speed (from speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight>), the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will know that the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is now going slower than the desired speed. In response, the processor will increase the duty cycle using the PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; and thereby increase the power applied to the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>. This feedback loop will continue, with a continuously increasing duty cycle, until the measured speed is again in a substantially one-to-one correspondence with the desired speed. The same process occurs when the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> goes down a hill, except that the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will decrease the duty cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> curve illustrating the relation between speed and track voltage of the present invention is illustrated in comparison to the conventional speed vs. track voltage curve shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As is evident, the speed control system of the present invention results in a single curve that is independent of load, whereas the conventional speed control system includes a line for each load (light-load and heavy load shown). Accordingly, for every given track voltage, the present invention will maintain the corresponding speed by continuously adjusting the duty cycle. The single curve derived from the speed control of the present invention will always lie to the right of the light/heavy load lines of the conventional system so that the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can modulate the motor voltage at less than or equal to the maximum voltage available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> It can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> that the single curve of the present invention is defined by three distinct regions. Region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> defines the track voltage over which the train does not move (i.e., speed&equals;0). In other words, if a user manually turns on the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a track voltage in Region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will direct the PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; to a zero duty cycle. Therefore, the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> will not receive any power. Region <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is set to be above the drop out voltage of the particular power source in order to be compatible with the existing signaling method for interrupting track voltage in order to make a transition between forward, reverse, or neutral modes of operation for the train. Region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> defines a gradual increase in speed with increased track voltage and Region <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> defines an increased slope for the speed vs. track voltage curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The reduced slope of Region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provides a significant advantage. Finite speed changes at slower speeds are more noticeable than at faster speeds. For example, the change in speed that a car makes from 60 mph to 65 mph is much less noticeable than a car that changes speeds from 5 mph to 10 mph. Accordingly, the reduced slope of Region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provides an improved resolution for slow speed operation. Moreover, all available power sources inherently have finite output impedance (i.e., meaning their voltage drops slightly with increasing load) causing load disturbance and/or change. The effects of such load disturbances and/or changes are relatively higher for slow speed operation versus high speed operation. Accordingly, the reduced slope of Region <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> helps mitigate these effects on the desired speed of the train. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In fact, because the PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; is directed by the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to continuously modulate the voltage applied to the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>, the present invention provides the capability to set forth any range of speed vs. track voltage curves by programming the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to control the PWMC <highlight><bold>2071</bold></highlight>&prime; in the desired manner. For example, a user can provide dramatic increases in speed (resulting in an increased slope) by increasing the rate at which the duty cycle increases in response to an increased track voltage. Similarly, a user can provide very fine speed adjustments by decreasing the rate at which the duty cycle increases in response to an increased track voltage. Accordingly, the accuracy and precision of slow speed operation is significantly improved. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Speed Control&mdash;Command Mode </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> A discussion of the novel speed control of the present invention is now discussed with respect to the &ldquo;Command mode&rdquo;, which can be selected via the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that trains equipped with the engine board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are capable of operating in either Command or Conventional mode. The default is Command mode. However, a user may disable Command mode by entering an appropriate command on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, at which point the train will operate in Conventional mode. Entering another command on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will return the train to Command mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> When in &ldquo;Command mode&rdquo;, the user will adjust the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such that the track voltage is set at a pre-determined maximum value (e.g., the power source&apos;s maximum). Once the pre-determined maximum value for the voltage across the track is set, the user no longer needs to adjust the track voltage for changing speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Turning back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the speed control system used in &ldquo;Command Mode&rdquo; is the same as used in the &ldquo;Conventional Mode&rdquo; and thereby operates in the same manner. That is, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> compares the speed command and the actual speed and adjusts the duty cycle to obtain the desired speed. However, in &ldquo;Command Mode&rdquo;, the speed command is no longer a function of the track voltage selected by the user either directly or indirectly. As discussed above, the track voltage is set at a predetermined maximum. Instead, the speed command is directly inputted into the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a particular train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Each train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a unique digital address. Accordingly, a user will first input into the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>specific train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whose speed the user wants to change, and then inputs the desired speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will output a signal embedded with the digital address and the desired speed into the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and onto the track. The signal will &ldquo;find&rdquo; the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whose digital address matches the one embedded in the signal. The signal will then be inputted into the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the selected train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and be fed into the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> At this point, the speed control feedback works similarly to the &ldquo;Conventional Mode&rdquo;. That is, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receives the speed command in digital form. The A/D converter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> samples the track voltage, which is set at the desired maximum voltage, and outputs a signal to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The processor then compares the speed command to the maximum voltage and determines a duty cycle that will accurately modulate the maximum track voltage to the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> in order to achieve the desired speed. Accordingly, in &ldquo;Command Mode&rdquo;, a user can select different speeds for every train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the track by simply using the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in &ldquo;Command Mode&rdquo;, the acceleration and deceleration at which the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> reach the desired speed can be adjusted. In addition to a default acceleration/deceleration, there are a plurality of other acceleration/deceleration rates that are stored in flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. More acceleration/deceleration rates can be added by inputting and storing the desired rates using the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The user simply accesses the appropriate file in the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> related to the acceleration/deceleration rates and selects the desired rate. Even further, the acceleration rates can be distinct and independent from the deceleration rates, thereby allowing the user to have different rates for acceleration and deceleration. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Coupler Design </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Another inventive feature of the present invention is a new coupler design. Couplers are used on model trains to connect a train to one or more box cars, oil tankers, other trains, or other loads. The couplers also connect between box cars, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a conventional mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for connecting and disconnecting trains is illustrated. The main components of the conventional mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> include a knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a knuckle spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a knuckle pin <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a housing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a housing lock pin <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a latch member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a latch member hole <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, a latch member spring <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, a latch plate post <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a latch plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, a knuckle latch ramp <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a knuckle latch notch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrates a bottom view of the latch member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> taken from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The operation and functionality of each of the components of the conventional mechanical coupler will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>illustrate the process by which two trains are coupled together. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows two conventional mechanical couplers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on different trains (not shown) in the unlocked open position, where one train is approaching the other. Each knuckle includes two arms <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>&Prime;. Knuckle arm <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>&Prime; includes on an outer portion thereon the knuckle latch ramp <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the knuckle latch notch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is rotatable about the knuckle pin <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and is biased open by knuckle spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (bias illustrated by semi-circular arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the user will direct one of the trains into the other such that the respective knuckle arms <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>&prime; pass each other and come into contact with an inner surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>&prime; of the housing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the other coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The contour of the inner surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>&prime; of the housing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> causes the knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to rotate about its knuckle pin <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> toward the latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> that is positioned within an opening of the knuckle&apos;s housing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the rotation of the knuckles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> will cause the knuckle latch ramp <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) on the respective knuckles <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to engage the latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. This mechanical interaction between the knuckle latch ramp <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> will raise the latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and latch member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> against the bias of latch member spring <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. When the knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has rotated a sufficient amount, the latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> will be forced into the knuckle latch notch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> via latch member spring <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> so that the coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be locked in the closed position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The conventional mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be opened in two ways: either by manually raising latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> out of knuckle latch notch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, or by providing a magnetic pull on latch plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to raise latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> out of knuckle latch notch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The magnetic pull is derived from an electromagnet (not shown) that is built into the track layout at a given location. Accordingly, a user will need to position the train such that the latch plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is positioned over the electromagnet. The user will then energize the electromagnet for pulling the latch plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> toward the electromagnet, thereby moving the latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> out of the knuckle latch notch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Once the latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is raised out of knuckle latch notch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, knuckle spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will force the knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (and knuckle latch ramp <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>/knuckle latch notch <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>) back into the unlocked open position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). When the manual or magnetic force is removed, latch member spring <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> will return the latch member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> back into their normal position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> One of the disadvantages of the conventional mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is that, to unlatch a coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the user must either manually raise the latch member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> every time a de-coupling is desired, or place the train precisely in a particular position on the track so that the latch plate <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is located over an operating electromagnet. Furthermore, in order to provide the remote de-coupling, a large electromagnet requiring substantial energy is required in order to overcome the frictional forces resulting from the metal-metal contact between the various elements (e.g., latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and housing <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>; housing lock pin <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and latch member <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>; latch pin <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and knuckle <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

The conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> was designed to overcome the deficiencies of the conventional mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In particular, the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> was developed to allow remote controlled de-coupling operations to take place anywhere on the track. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> comprises a housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and solenoid coil <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> further includes a knuckle <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, latch plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, latch plunger spring <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, knuckle spring <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and knuckle pin <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrates a cross-sectional view of a conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in the unlocked open position while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>illustrates a cross-sectional view of a conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in the locked closed position. Similarly to the conventional mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> discussed above (see, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), when two couplers <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are brought together, the respective knuckle arms <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>&prime; will engage the inner surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>&prime; of the other coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, causing the respective knuckles <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> to rotate about their knuckle pins <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> During initial rotation, the knuckle latch ramp <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; will contact the latch plunger nubbin <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>&prime;, thereby pushing the latch plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> against the latch plunger spring <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. When the knuckle <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> has rotated a sufficient amount, the latch plunger nubbin <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>&prime; will be forced by the latch plunger spring <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> into the knuckle latch notch <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>- and the coupler will be locked in the closed position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> With the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, de-coupling is done remotely through electronic control. In particular, the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is electrically energized by circuitry in the train, typically a capacitor (not shown), which is driven by the voltage through the tracks. One of the main problems with the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is the amount of voltage required to sufficiently energize the solenoid <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> for driving the plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. For example, it may take upwards of 12 volts for the solenoid <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> to provide the electromagnetic pull required to move the plunger nubbin <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>&prime; away from engagement with the knuckle <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. Additionally, a user would have to put the train in neutral in order to charge the capacitor, and only after the capacitor was sufficiently charged could the coupler be fired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as discussed above with respect to the conventional mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, this results in inefficient, costly power consumption. In cases where the tracks provide the voltage used to energize the solenoid <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> (without a capacitor), a user must provide sufficient voltage on the track to effect a de-coupling operation. However, if the user desires to drive the trains at a slow speed which requires less than 12 volts, the user must speed up the trains by increasing the track voltage solely for effecting the de-coupling operation, and then reduce the track voltage to return to the desired train speed/operating conditions. This results in an inconvenient and repetitive process of speeding up and slowing down trains solely for the purpose of de-coupling trains. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for reducing the voltage required to energize the solenoid <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the present invention is illustrated. The coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> includes a coupler body <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight>. The coupler body <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight> has two ends, one end <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight>&prime; for connecting the coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to the train and the other end <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight>&Prime; for connecting the coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to another coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of a different train. The coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is driven by a solenoid assembly <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>; however, any conventional driver can be utilized (e.g., DC linear motor). The solenoid assembly <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> includes a bobbin <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; and bobbin through-hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&Prime;, a solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a solenoid sleeve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>), and a solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The solenoid sleeve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> surrounds the bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; while the solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> close the respective openings at the ends of solenoid sleeve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; includes at least one lead wire <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extending therefrom which is connected to the coupler body <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight> via any known suitable means (e.g., soldering). The lead wire <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> receives a voltage from the track in order to provide power to the solenoid assembly <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the solenoid assembly <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is housed in an open portion of the coupler body <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> further includes a plunger assembly <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The plunger assembly <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> includes a plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and a plunger spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> includes an enlarged diameter head portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime; located at one end of the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and another enlarged diameter ring portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&Prime; located near the one end, thereby forming a groove <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; therebetween. The plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is a hollow ring-shaped member with an inner circumferential surface <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>&prime; defined therein. Extending radially inward from the inner circumferential surface <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>&prime; is an annular projection <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>&Prime;. Accordingly, the annular projection <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is tightly fit into the groove <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; of the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> therefore locking together the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> can also be formed from a single piece of material; however, the manufacturing cost may be increased and/or the benefits of low friction material in the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> may be lost. The integrally formed plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> define a gap <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> located between the inner circumferential surface <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>&prime; of the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and an outer circumferential surface of the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The plunger spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> functions to bias the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>/plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> toward a knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (described below) and away from the solenoid assembly <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. One end of the plunger spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is seated against the solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and the other end of the plunger spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is guided by the gap <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to be seated on the annular projection <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The end <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the coupler body <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight> which connects to a coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of another train includes a knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a knuckle pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and a knuckle spring <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> includes therein a slot <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&prime; whose functionality will be discussed below. The end <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the coupler body <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight> further includes two outwardly extending projections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> which form a U-shape. The projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has a cut-out portion extending into the projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, thereby defining an opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and two parallel arms <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The two arms <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime; each have a hole <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> extending therethrough for receiving the knuckle pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is sized to receive a portion of the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, which portion includes a hole therethrough for receiving the knuckle pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is attached to the coupler body <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight> by placing the knuckle portion into the opening <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and inserting the knuckle pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> through the respective holes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the two arms <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime; and the knuckle portion. The knuckle pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be fixed to the projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> using any suitable fastening means (e.g., washer). The knuckle spring <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is fitted between the knuckle portion and either arm <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime; of the projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for biasing the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> towards its open position (i.e., rotated away from the coupler body <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight>). Extending from the other projection <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is an inner curved surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>&prime; whose contour effects the coupling of two couplers <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> as will be discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Operation and the functional relationship between the elements of the novel coupler of the present invention will now be discussed with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. The knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> can be in a closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>or an opened position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. At least one of the couplers <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> needs to be in the open position when coupling of two trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is desired. That is, the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of one or both of the couplers <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> needs to be configured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> When two trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are ready to be coupled together (i.e., the knuckles <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the respective couplers <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are facing one another), the user enters a command on the hand-held remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to move one of the trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> towards the other (the user could of course also manually bring the trains together). Similarly to the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, as the trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> approach one another, the knuckle arms <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&Prime; of each knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> pass each other and engage the inner curved surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>&prime; of the other coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the knuckles <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are forced to rotate about their knuckle pin <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> inward against the bias of the knuckle spring <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. As the knuckles <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> rotate, the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is forced toward the solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (i.e., the rotational motion of the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> forces the translational motion of the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>). The knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> slides across the enlarged diameter head portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime; of the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> retreats downward against the bias of the plunger spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> When the two trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are pushed into each other a sufficient amount, the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> will fall into the slot <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&prime; of the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the plunger spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will force the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> into the slot <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&prime;. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> serves as a stop for preventing the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> from rotating to the open position through the bias of the knuckle spring <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. As a result, each knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is locked in the closed position, with the respective knuckle arms <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&Prime; held together in an overlapping manner (see dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b,d</italic></highlight>, which represents another coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>). Accordingly, the two trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are coupled together in a simple, one step process of simply moving the trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> against each other. In fact, a model train engine or car equipped with an open novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can latch and then unlatch with an open or closed novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, conventional mechanical coupler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> on other train cars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> When the user wishes to de-couple the trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, he/she simply enters the command on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> sends the command (via TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) over the track as discussed above to the engine board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> thereon. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receives the de-couple command and in response, pulses the track voltage to the lead wires <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in order to energize the bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; of the solenoid assembly <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Energizing the bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; generates a magnetic field. The magnetic field follows a path around the bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; of the bobbin assembly <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, through the solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the solenoid sleeve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and through a minimized gap between the solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The magnetic field causes an attraction between the solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> thereby pulling the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> toward the solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> against the bias of the plunger spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will continue to move toward the solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> until the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> engages the solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, which serves as a stop for the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, or when the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is released from the locked position. The distance between the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the portion of the solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> adjacent to the bobbin <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is configured to be sufficient to allow the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to move out of the slot <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&prime; of the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is forced outwardly away from the coupler body <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight> by the knuckle spring <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. At that point, the knuckles <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are in the open position and the trains <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are allowed to de-couple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> As the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> opens, the distance between the projection <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the knuckle arm <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&Prime; increases (see transition from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). As a result, the knuckle arm <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&Prime; of one coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> has sufficient room to move out of engagement with the knuckle arm <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the other coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a second knuckle arm <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; of one coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> further facilitates de-coupling by rotating into the knuckle arm <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the other coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in the closed position, thereby pushing the knuckle arm <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&Prime; out of its closed position. It should be noted that the knuckle configuration of the present invention is such that only one bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; needs to be fired to actuate the de-coupling, although if desired, the bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; of both couplers <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> could be fired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the present invention operates at significantly less voltage than the prior art due to its unique structure and mechanical connections. The present invention contemplates that the amount of voltage necessary to fire the couplers is approximately 6 volts, or about half the amount of voltage necessary in the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. As a result, the coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be opened at minimal track voltage without the need to first increase the track voltage to a sufficient amount, or to place the train in neutral and use charged capacitors to provide sufficient voltage to operate the coupler mechanism, as was required by the prior art. </paragraph>

Both couplers draw voltage from the track to energize their respective solenoids for producing a magnetic field comprising magnetic flux lines. The magnetic flux lines run through the plunger to create a pull on the plunger in the direction of the magnetic flux lines. The more flux lines produced and the more dense those flux lines are, the more magnetic pull applied to the plunger. Ideally, all flux lines should run through the plunger in order to optimize the full pull force available from the magnetic flux lines created by the solenoid. Accordingly, the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the present invention was designed and configured to increase the amount and density of magnetic flux as well as to create a magnetic circuit that maximizes the amount of flux lines that run through the plunger (as opposed to outside of the plunger). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> In order to increase magnetic flux, the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> provides an improved &ldquo;magnetic circuit&rdquo; that incorporates ferromagnetic material. Specifically, each of solenoid sleeve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are made from ferromagnetic material (preferably, steel) for conducting the magnetic flux lines in an intimate closed circuit. Accordingly, a greater number of magnetic flux lines that are more closely spaced (i.e., more dense) are produced. Furthermore, as the solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> surrounds the majority of the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the closed magnetic circuit produced by the configuration of the aforementioned elements of the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> increases the number of flux lines that run through the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>illustrates generally the magnetic flux lines produced by the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the present invention (the thickness of the sleeve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has been exaggerated to better illustrate the sleeve&apos;s ability to contain essentially all the flux lines within its thickness). In contrast, turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, the magnetic flux lines produced by the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are both smaller in amount and more diffuse (i.e., less dense), resulting in a less-efficient conversion of voltage to magnetic pull. In addition, some of the flux lines run outside of the plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> (adjacent the plunger nubbin <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>&prime;), thereby wasting a portion of the magnetic pull created by the solenoid wiring <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Several factors contribute to this deficiency in the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Foremost among them is the lack of ferromagnetic material for conducting the magnetic flux lines. The only ferromagnetic material found in the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is in the plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is made from non-ferromagnetic material (e.g., zinc). Furthermore, there is no sleeve, solenoid forward end, or solenoid back end to form a closed magnetic circuit around the solenoid wiring <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as there is no structural boundary for which to contain the magnetic flux lines, leaving only air as the magnetic conductor (which is highly inefficient), the resulting magnetic flux lines are diffused about a greater area surrounding the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, the magnetic flux lines produced in the conventional solenoid coupler are far fewer and less dense than those produced in the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>. Because the end portion of the plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> (including plunger nubbin <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>&prime;) is not surrounded by a ferromagnetic material (which would have extended more of the magnetic circuit through the plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>), some flux lines are lost from the plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> in the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>(flux lines moving away from plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> before running completely through plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> As a result of the structural distinction between the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the present invention and the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> will produce significantly more magnetic pull with the same amount of applied voltage. It follows that the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> will require less voltage than the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to produce the same magnetic pull. For example, if it takes 12 volts to provide the needed magnetic pull for moving the plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> out of engagement with the knuckle <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> (thereby effecting a de-coupling operation) in the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, it would take only about 6 volts in the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the aforementioned difference in voltage requirements between the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the novel solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is based on the assumption that the various mechanical interactions (e.g., plunger sliding on bobbin/housing, knuckle/plunger interface, etc.) result in the same frictional resistance in both couplers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> However, another advantage of the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is the elimination of metal-to-metal contact, which decreases wear/tear (improving reliability) as well as decreasing the frictional forces that the magnetic pull needs to overcome for de-coupling the coupler. The conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> does not include a bobbin and therefore the solenoid wiring <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is wrapped directly around the metal (e.g., zinc) housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. As a result, the steel plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is in bearing contact with the inner surface of the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. This metal-to-metal contact increases the resistive frictional forces, thereby increasing the amount of magnetic pull needed to pull the plunger, as well as adding to the wear/tear of both the plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> incorporates a spool-like Acetal plastic bobbin <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which holds the bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; around its outer surface. It should be appreciated that any low-friction plastic may be used (e.g., Nylon). Accordingly, the metal plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is in bearing contact with the plastic inner surface of the spool-like bobbin <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> within the bobbin through-hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&Prime;, resulting in less wear/tear and frictional resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Similarly with respect to the knuckle/plunger mechanical interaction, the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> incorporates metal-metal contact (steel plunger nubbin <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>&prime; and zinc knuckle <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>). In contrast, the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is made from low-friction plastic (Acetal, Nylon, etc.), thereby inducing a plastic-metal contact between itself and the knuckle. As a result, the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> greatly reduces the wear/tear and frictional resistance resulting from the mechanical movements within the coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Other improvements and advantages of the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> will now be discussed. The solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> serves other important functions in addition to completing the magnetic circuit for the flux lines. In particular, the solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> serves as a bearing for the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, thereby guiding movement of the plunger assembly <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> may be configured with an inner diameter slightly larger than the diameter of the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in order to prevent bearing metal-to-metal contact therebetween, further reducing friction and wear. As a result of the bearing contact between the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (which is also a plastic-metal interface for reducing frictional/wear), any side thrust force exerted on the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> from the coupling operation will be absorbed at the end of the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (as opposed to the portion of the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> just outside of the bobbin <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). This dramatically reduces any bending movement applied to the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which would otherwise damage the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> over time. In addition, the solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> acts as a locating feature for mounting the bobbin <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> onto the coupler body <highlight><bold>2061</bold></highlight>. These combined functions of the solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> reduce tolerance buildups in the overall design of the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Even further, the configuration of the solenoid forward end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> provides the capability to exclude the plunger spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from the magnetic path (by functioning as a spring seat outside of the magnetic path; see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>), thereby allowing the magnetic path to incorporate as much steel as possible. However, in the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the plunger spring <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is positioned within the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. This displaces steel from the magnetic circuit (e.g., by displacing a solenoid back end) of the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which contributes to fact that the magnetic path in the conventional solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is essentially all air (except for plunger <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>). As discussed above, the solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> closes the magnetic circuit and increases the amount of metal (e.g., steel) in the magnetic circuit (thereby increasing magnetic flux). As an additional enhancement for the magnetic flux, the solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> includes a conical end shape <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime; that receives a corresponding conical end portion of plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. This configuration further minimizes air gaps in the magnetic circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> provides several important functions, some of which include: (1) acting as a seat and pocket for the plunger spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, (2) acting as a bearing for the end of the plunger assembly <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> contacting the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, (3) acting as a stop for the plunger assembly <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> when the bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; is energized (importantly, this function prevents contact between the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and solenoid back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, which could otherwise allow residual magnetic fields to keep the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the energized position; i.e., precluding the ability to lock the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in the closed position), and (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) acting as the surface which latches into the slot <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>&prime; of the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. It is preferred that the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> be made of a one-piece construction, thereby minimizing parts and tolerances. The hole through the bobbin <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> serves as a bearing for the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Thus, the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> motion is guided by plastic bearings, avoiding metal-to-metal contact with its consequential high friction forces and wear. It is further preferred that the plunger cap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and bobbin <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> be made from Acetal Plastic or other low friction, high impact plastic (including but not limited to Nylon), thereby minimizing friction in the bearing and latch functionality resulting in a further reduction in the voltage required to energize the bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> In summary, the coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the present invention provides significant advantages over the conventional prior art couplers for several reasons. In particular, the construction of the coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the present invention greatly reduces the frictional forces between the moving parts resulting from the locking and unlocking of the knuckle <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> into and out of coupling position. Accordingly, the coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> avoids the wear and tear inherent in the prior art couplers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The steel back end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, sleeve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and front end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> form a magnetic path with the plunger <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which greatly enhances the flux generated in the bobbin wiring <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime;, compared to the prior art solenoid coupler <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The combination of low friction and efficient magnetic path allow the novel coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to operate under much lower voltage than the prior art. The novel configuration of the coupler <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the present invention therefore provides significant advantages over the prior art both in its structure and its function. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Smoke/Steam Unit </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Yet another feature of the present invention is a new smoke/steam unit design. Various methods exist in the prior art for producing puffs of &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; or steam from the model train, in an effort to depict a real train working as it moves down a track. This application will refer to the &ldquo;smoke unit&rdquo; hereafter, although it should be understood that the same design and principles apply to &ldquo;steam.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, an exemplary novel smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the present invention will be described. The smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> includes two resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, fiberglass material <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, an oil substance <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, and a fan <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. One resistor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can also be used, preferably in combination with a biasing member <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), but two resistors will more securely hold the fiberglass material. The smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> produces smoke by supplying the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> with track voltage. Consequently, the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> heat up and vaporize the oil substance <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> to produce the smoke while the fan <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> &ldquo;puffs&rdquo; out the smoke from the train. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The quantity of smoke outputted by the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is directly related to the power applied to the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. That is, the more voltage applied to the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the more smoke will be outputted. The smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> can be controlled in two modes, manual and automatic. The user can select in which mode to operate by inputting the desired mode on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In manual mode, the user will input on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> one of, for example, three possible quantities of smoke: high, medium, and low (it should appreciated that that any number of quantities of smoke can easily be programmed into the processor). Accordingly, at any time during operation for any train(s), the user can initiate a smoke output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> For example, if the user wants one of the train(s) to puff a high quantity of smoke (e.g., when climbing a hill, implying the engine is working hard), the user first inputs the digital address of the desired train(s) (or, if the user desires all the train(s) to output the smoke, then he/she can go directly to the next step without indicating a particular train). Next, the user enters the quantity of smoke desired (low, medium, and high) into the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> sends the request via RF signals to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which in turn sends the request to the track <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The signal from the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> searches for the selected train(s) via the digital address. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on the engine board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the train(s) will interpret the signal as a request for a low, medium, or high quantity of smoke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> adjusts the amount of voltage applied to the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, and thereby the quantity of smoke, by using a smoke system driver circuit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) that comprises a pulse width modulator circuit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> to adjust the time that voltage is applied to a resistor circuit driver <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, which controls the voltage applied to the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The fan <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> will be turned on via a fan motor drive circuit <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, to puff out the smoke. Accordingly, the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> will be able to produce the needed smoke independently of the track voltage. For example, if the track voltage is high but the request for smoke is low, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will adjust the power applied to the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> by pulse width modulating the track voltage to decrease the time the voltage is applied to the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Similarly, if the track voltage is low (e.g., in &ldquo;Conventional&rdquo; or &ldquo;Legacy&rdquo; mode, where the train(s) are moving at slow speeds), the pulse width modulator <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> will increase the time the voltage is applied to the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the voltage applied to the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> could also be controlled by using a linear voltage regulator (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Another novel feature of the present invention is the fast response time of the smoke system driver circuit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The smoke system driver circuit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the present invention uses an electronic brake (not shown) located in the fan motor drive circuit <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> to quickly stop or start blowing the smoke out of the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. In particular, the electronic brake is a FET (not shown) that is placed across the fan motor that will short out the motor when the user commands the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to stop blowing smoke. As an alternative, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can also be programmed to momentarily reverse the voltage on the motor to stop the fan <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> even quicker. Accordingly, the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> will immediately stop or start blowing smoke at the user&apos;s command. In another embodiment, the fan <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> would run continuously and a valve or shutter could be used to stop the airflow at the desired time, thereby stopping the flow of smoke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In automatic mode, the novel smoke system driver circuit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the present invention will control the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> according to the speed and load of the train(s) in order simulate a realistic steam and/or diesel train. In other words, the smoke will be outputted automatically at a rate and quantity that matches the current condition of the train(s), similarly to what takes place in a real-life train. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> The rate at which the smoke is &ldquo;puffed&rdquo; out is dependent on the speed of the train(s). There are various types of trains, each having distinct qualities with respect to their respective smoking systems. A steam engine train will output discrete &ldquo;puffs&rdquo; of smoke in response to the revolutions on the wheel. For example, for every &frac14; turn of a wheel, the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> would output one &ldquo;puff&rdquo; of smoke (of course, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be programmed, via the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, to any correlation between the wheel revolutions and the number of &ldquo;puffs&rdquo;). In contrast, a diesel engine train outputs smoke at a continuous rate. The smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the present invention works under both conditions (discrete vs. continuous). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in steam engine mode (which can be selected using the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>), the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will control the on/off switching rate of the fan <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> based on the output of the speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight>. The speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight>, as discussed above, is a direct measure of the revolutions per minute (&ldquo;rpm&rdquo;) of the wheels of the train(s). Accordingly, if the speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight> indicates that the wheels are turning at 100 rpm, then the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will command the fan <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to turn on and off at 400 times/minute (100 revolutions*4 &ldquo;puffs&rdquo; per revolution). In diesel mode, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will use steady state control of the fan <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, as opposed to on/off switching, to gradually increase the rate the smoke is outputted as the speed of the train increases. This is accomplished by the PWM <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The operation of the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> in automatic mode with respect to the quantity of smoke will now be discussed. In order to obtain the quantity of smoke to be output by the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will determine the load on the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> of a train(s) by calculating the power that is currently required to move the train(s) at a given speed. The calculated result is then compared to the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; power required to move the train(s) at the given speed, which &ldquo;normal power&rdquo; is stored in flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> for the particular motor on the engine board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This comparison will indicate to the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> whether the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> is requiring more power or less power than normal to run at the current speed. Accordingly, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will implicitly know the load on the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> of the train(s). The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will then automatically operate the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> according to the load on the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> An example will better illustrate how the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> controls the quantity of smoke in automatic mode. As discussed above, a user initiates operation by inputting on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> the desire for the system to be in automatic mode for the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the train is running under normal conditions, the comparison of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; power consumption of the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> at a given speed and the actual power consumption of the motor at the given speed will have a one-to-one ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> However, when the train goes up a hill, although the speed will remain the same as a result of the novel speed control system of the present invention and therefore the rate of puffs will not change, the power inputted into the motor will increase (which will be sensed by a voltage sensor for example) by virtue of the increased duty cycle. Accordingly, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will deduce that the load on the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> has increased. As a result, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will command that more voltage be applied to the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> by increasing the duty cycle via the pulse width modulator circuit <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> (the fan <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> will remain at the same rate because the train is moving at the same speed). The resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> will get hotter and thereby release a more dense &ldquo;puff&rdquo; of smoke. Similarly, when going down hill, the reduced load on the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> is sensed, the duty cycle reduced, and the resistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> will get less hot and thereby release a less dense &ldquo;puff&rdquo; of smoke. The density of smoke will be output in the same fashion regardless of being in diesel mode or steam engine mode. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Some other features of the present invention are now described. The processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be directed by the user via the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to automatically retrieve, for example, a brake sound when the train slows down at a given rate. For example, if the track voltage (reflecting user&apos;s desired speed) in &ldquo;Conventional Mode&rdquo; is reduced at a rate faster than 5 MPH/second, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will sense the deceleration using the feedback from the speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight> and thereby retrieve the requisite sound file to play a &ldquo;braking&rdquo; sound. As another example, if the contact between the roller (not shown) of the train(s) which rolls on the charged center rail is lost, for example if the train is derailed (i.e., speeding too fast around a corner, etc.), the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be programmed to retrieve a &ldquo;crash&rdquo; sound stored in the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Doppler Effect Features </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Each of the sounds played through the train speaker <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&Prime; can be modified to incorporate the Doppler Effect. A description of the Doppler effect characteristics of the present invention will now be provided. The Doppler effect is a well-known principle that represents the change in pitch and volume that results from a shift in the frequency of the sound waves as evidenced by the sound of an approaching object. A common example of the Doppler effect is experienced when an ambulance or fire truck approaches. As the vehicle approaches an observer, the sound waves from the siren are compressed towards the observer. The intervals between the sound waves diminish, which results in an increase in the frequency or pitch of the siren. As the vehicle recedes past the observer, the sound waves are stretched relative to the observer, causing a decrease in the pitch of the siren. Thus, by listening to the change in pitch of a siren, the observer is able to determine if the vehicle is approaching or speeding away. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> The most basic implementation of the Doppler effect in the present invention will be referred to as a &ldquo;Doppler run.&rdquo; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>graphically depicts the Doppler run mode. The user sets the volume of the train sounds at some maximum arbitrary level, such as 75 dB (this is a non-limiting example only) from the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As the model train cycles around the tracks, the user enters the command for a Doppler run. This is based on a fixed distance that the train travels, and can be pre-programmed to any reasonable distance. As one example, assuming the model track layout is approximately 25 feet of track, the fixed distance could advantageously be programmed to be 25 feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Once the user enters the Doppler run command, the volume of the train immediately drops to a fixed attenuation level, for example, 40 dB. The train processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> then monitors the distance the train travels (speed versus time) and causes the sound output from the train to rise from the 40 dB level to the maximum arbitrary level of 75 dB. The maximum volume level is obtained at approximately the mid-way point of the fixed distance (in the above example, at approximately 12.5 feet). The sound then drops back to the attenuated level of 40 dB, which is reached when the train completes the fixed distance (in the given example, at the point where 25 feet of track has been traversed). The pitch of the sound behaves in the same fashion, and is a function of the real-time speed of the train. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The Doppler run command allows a user to simulate the real-life Doppler effect on the model train track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, assume that the user has an observer stationed at one end of the track. At the point when the train is the farthest away from the observer, the user enters the Doppler run command. The sound of the train will immediately drop to the attenuated level and shift the pitch according to the speed of the train, giving the observer the effect that the train is far off in the distance. As the train approaches the observer, the sound increases until the point when the train passes the observer, at which point the maximum volume is reached. The pitch of the train increases as it approaches and then drops to a zero shift at the point when the volume is maximum. Once the train passes the observer, the sound immediately begins to decrease and the pitch is at a negative frequency shift (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). Thus, the observer is left with a sense of the real Doppler effect, as the train whooshes past the observer. The observer hears the oncoming sound followed by the receding fade in the same manner as a person standing by a real set of train tracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> The next embodiment of the Doppler effect in the present invention is called the &ldquo;Doppler repeat.&rdquo; This mode of operation is graphically depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The user enters a &ldquo;Mark Start&rdquo; command on the remote control. This resets an internal odometer inside the model train. The odometer accumulates the distance travelled by the train until the user enters a &ldquo;Mark Repeat&rdquo; command on the remote control. The accumulated distance from Mark Start to Mark Repeat is the &ldquo;Doppler loop.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> In operation, the user then enters the Doppler repeat command. The volume immediately drops to the far-off attenuation level, for example, 40 dB, and the pitch shifts according to the train speed. The model train processor then calculates the required distance for causing the Doppler peak to occur at the Doppler loop point. The volume will thereafter peak at every Doppler loop distance travelled, and the pitch shift will demonstrate the characteristics shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, until the user turns off the Doppler repeat command. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Chuff Sounds </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the smoke unit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can be programmed to automatically output sounds corresponding to the condition of the train(s) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Specifically, every time the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> sends a &ldquo;puff&rdquo; signal to the smoke system driver circuit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> in response to the feedback of the speed sensor <highlight><bold>2073</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will simultaneously retrieve from the flash memory <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> a &ldquo;chuff&rdquo; sound file. This chuff sound file is sent to the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, for every &ldquo;puff&rdquo; of smoke there will a &ldquo;chuff&rdquo; of sound, both corresponding to the speed of the train. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Further, there are three possible &ldquo;chuff&rdquo; sounds reflective of the load on the train(s): constant (normal), labored &ldquo;chuff&rdquo; and drift &ldquo;chuff&rdquo;. Again, with respect to the load on the train(s), the sound system circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> will respond via the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the load measurements on the motor <highlight><bold>2072</bold></highlight> in the same fashion as the smoke system driver circuit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. That is, if for example the train <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is going up a hill, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will sense the increase in load and will thereby alter the sound to reflect a &ldquo;labored&rdquo; chuff sound. In the same way, if the train(s) is going down a hill, the processor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will sense the decrease in load and will thereby alter the sound to reflect a &ldquo;drift&rdquo; chuff sound. In addition, the &ldquo;labored&rdquo; and &ldquo;drift&rdquo; chuff sounds can be utilized in the &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; or &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; mode of operation in the following manner: whenever track voltage is increased, &ldquo;labored&rdquo; chuffs will be played, and conversely, whenever track voltage is decreased, &ldquo;drift&rdquo; chuffs will be played. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Light Control </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> The light driver circuit <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> includes a pulse width modulator (not shown) in order to maintain the same brightness regardless of the track voltage to thereby attain the realism associated with a real-life train (i.e., a real-life train does not regulate its light output dependent on power to the engine). Of course, it is also contemplated that a user could obtain a desired brightness and colors by entering the command on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Accessory Interface Unit </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be discussed in greater detail. The AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> functions to control operation of any of the accessories (examples provided below) included in the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (it should be noted that the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can also be coupled to accessories not within the immediate track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; e.g., a gas station around the periphery of the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). The AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be powered by any suitable means, including, but not limited to, a transformer connected to a standard wall outlet (not shown) (this can be same as the transformer the powering track), or a battery. The AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is coupled to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) via an input <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The connection between the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can also be any known suitable means, including, but not limited to, a phone line or a conventional power line. The difference between the two examples (phone line or conventional power line) lies in the type of communication signal (fiber optic phone signal or voltage at given frequency) that will be sent to the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> further includes a set of output relays <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> which are coupled to various portions of the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through standard hard wiring (i.e., voltage/current carrying lines). Accordingly, the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be connected to a wide range of accessories in any configuration desired by the user, details of which will be discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> The AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> functions to operate the various accessories (i.e., turn on/off) in response to user commands on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Specifically, when a user enters a command to turn on a street light, for example, the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will output an RF signal to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In turn, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will output the command via the connection (phone line or conventional power line) to the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will then switch on/off the appropriate relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> coupled to the selected accessory to thereby turn on/off power to the selected accessory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> When a user first connects the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, he/she has the option to select any combination of accessories to be simultaneously switched with each respective relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. For example, the user can couple one relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> to a series of street lights (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) distributed throughout the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, the user can couple another relay to a track switches for changing the train path in the layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the user can couple each of the relays marked, for example, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, to a different series of accessories. Moreover, the combinations are not limited to the same type of accessories for each relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. In other words, a single given relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> can be coupled to a street light, a crossing gate, and a track switch. It is quickly apparent that the number of combinations are endless, thereby limiting the user in creating a personal track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> only to the extent of his/her imagination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Once the user couples the desired relays <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> to the respective accessories throughout the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the user will then store into memory (either TIU flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> or remote control flash memory <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>&prime;) the respective configuration. For example, if a user couples relay &num;1 to all the street lights in the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the user will then input into the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that relay &num;1 will turn on all street lights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes push-buttons <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> with alphanumeric characters printed thereon. Accordingly, when programming a particular relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, the user will be able to name the respective category of accessories that the particular relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> will switch on. The user can then store in memory the specific name the user chooses to identify each configuration. That way, the user can simply scroll through the stored names using the thumb-wheel <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and select the name which matches the accessories the user wants to turn on. For example, let&apos;s assume a user couples relay &num;1 to all the street lights, relay &num;2 to the track switches on the southern part of the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and relay &num;3 to all the crossing gates on the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Using the push-buttons <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> with the alphanumeric characters printed thereon, the user can then spell out and store the names &ldquo;All street lights&rdquo; corresponding to relay &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;Southern track switches&rdquo; corresponding to relay &num;2, and &ldquo;All crossing gates&rdquo; corresponding to relay &num;3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Anytime the user wants to operate, for example, the track switches located on the southern part of the track layout, he/she need only scroll through the stored list of &ldquo;named&rdquo; relays and select &ldquo;Southern track switches&rdquo;, and the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will send the appropriate signal to the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> corresponding to the selected relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, thereby powering and switching the track switches on the southern portion of the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Each relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> has a corresponding switch that is configured to be turned on/off based on the output signal from the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, if a conventional power line is used for the connection between the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, then each relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> can be activated, and therefore identified, by a distinct voltage frequency. For example, if the user commands relay &num;1 to turn on, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will send out a voltage at 50 Hz, whereas if the user commands relay &num;2 to turn on, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will send out a voltage at 100 Hz. Accordingly, a different frequency will be applied to the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, depending on which relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is commanded to be turned on. A three wire serial interface connection between the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may also be used, wherein one wire is a data line that is set to the value of the most significant bit of the data byte being sent. A clock line is then pulsed high then low to clock in the signal into an 8 bit shift register in the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. After 8 bits have been clocked in, the entire byte is clocked out by pulsing the third line, which is a latch. The data in the byte is therefore essentially 7 bits of address to get to the particular relay in the AIU that the user wishes to open or close and 1 bit to determine if the relay is being opened or closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Of course, various other &ldquo;identifying&rdquo; means can be used such as voltage amplitude, fiber optic signals (phone line connection), etc. The general concept remains the same; that is, each relay <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> will be configured to be triggered (i.e., turned on/off) by a &ldquo;identification signal&rdquo; sent from the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in response to a user command to turn on a particular accessory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, it is contemplated that any number of AIUs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be used for the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention, although power constraints from the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may limit the number of AIUs that can be connected to a single TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Up to five AIUs connected to a single TIU has been tested successfully at the present time, although it is anticipated that this number will improve in the future. Accordingly, a user can obtain a large number of relays <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> needed for creating the desired combinations of accessories that are to be turned on/off together. Along the same line, a plurality of TIUs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can also be coupled to the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is made possible by its unique electrical configuration. With any given set-up (e.g., AIUs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and TIUs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), the user simply will identify and store the relays <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> into memory. It is clear that relay &num;1 of AIU &num;1 can easily be differentiated from relay &num;1 of AIU &num;2 by simply coding relay &num;1 of AIU &num;2 as relay &num;21 (on the assumption that AIU &num;1 has 20 relays). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that the AIUs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will have multiple inputs that can be monitored by the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, infrared switches (so-called &ldquo;infrared track activation devices (ITAD)&rdquo;) or mechanical contact switches may be connected to the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When such a switch is opened or closed, a signal is passed from the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can activate a related action. For example, an ITAD (which functions as an infrared motion detector) may be placed near the track and wired to the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> such that when a train passes, the ITAD switches and this action is then passed to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, now knowing where the train is on the track, could then activate a crossing gate located elsewhere on the track. Any number of connection possibilities can be achieved in accordance with this feature of the present invention. For simplicity&apos;s sake, only one input to the AIUs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are shown in the figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The SCS of the present invention provides the user with a wide range of accessories for incorporation into the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to further the conception of realism exuded by the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, a user may add an accessory such as a passenger station with &ldquo;people&rdquo; waiting to board the approaching train, which will change into an empty passenger station after the &ldquo;people&rdquo; have boarded the train and the train moved on. By wiring the passenger station to an AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the user can operate a motor (not shown) to move the panel holding the passengers behind the roof of the station when a train leaves the passenger station, thereby creating a realistic portrayal of a true passenger station). Similarly, a freight station is also contemplated by the present invention, where cargo replaces the passengers. The operation to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; the cargo when a train leaves is similar to the passenger station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that many other types of accessories may be used with the present invention, including, but not limited to, houses with internal lighting, drive-thru restaurants, lights along the track, crossing-gates, flashing barricades, track switches (where two distinct tracks, indicating different paths, come together into one track and the track switch determines which track the train will go on), bridges with lighting, water towers, fire houses with fire-trucks that go in and out from the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, billboards with speaker announcements, . . . etc. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Command Record </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is the &ldquo;record mode&rdquo; for recording a list of commands inputted on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be played back at a later time. A user can push a designated push-button <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> on the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to initiate &ldquo;record mode&rdquo;. Thereafter, the user can input any command (including actuation of any accessories) to drive the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the user can input a desired speed of 10 smph for two trains on the track in &ldquo;command mode&rdquo; of operation, a desired speed of 7 smph for the remaining trains on the track in &ldquo;conventional mode&rdquo;, firing couplers, playing music, switch track switches, turn on street lights, etc. Each command inputted in the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will be stored in the flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (or alternatively, the commands can be stored in the flash memory <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>&prime; of the remote control). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> When the user has finished his/her desired chronology of commands, the user will then push the appropriate push-button <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to &ldquo;stop recording&rdquo;. The user can then name the file and save it in a fashion similar to saving file names with respect to the accessories discussed above. Accordingly, the user will be able to &ldquo;play-back&rdquo; the commands at any time in the future by simply activating the stored file. This is done by scrolling through the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> using the thumb-wheel <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and finding the file identified by the name given to it (e.g., &ldquo;My favorite commands&rdquo;). By activating the desired file name, the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will then send the appropriate RF signal to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which will retrieve from its flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> the desired file and will automatically play back the list of commands as they were saved&excl;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Saving commands in &ldquo;record mode&rdquo; can be accomplished in many modes. One mode is during actual real time operation. That is, while &ldquo;record mode&rdquo; is on, the user can input commands and operate the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> under normal conditions. The remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will function to operate the track layout in real time while simultaneously directing the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to store each command, exactly as inputted in real time with the same time delay between commands, into its flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. When the user desires to stop recording, he/she simply presses the appropriate push-button <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and thereafter names the file. At which point, the commands, as their were entered, will be stored in the flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> under the given file name. The user is then free to continue operating the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> In another mode, the user can also &ldquo;record&rdquo; commands without operating the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This provides many benefits, one of which is illustrated with the following example. Assume a daughter wants to surprise her mom for her birthday by playing &ldquo;happy birthday&rdquo; through the speaker <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>&Prime; of one of the trains (via, e.g., a CD player) while driving the train towards her mom as she enters the room. If she was required to operate the train before the mom entered, the surprise would be ruined as the mom would hear the train moving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention allows the user to &ldquo;record&rdquo; into files several sets of commands very quickly and efficiently, as well as quietly (which will allow a user to continue &ldquo;recording&rdquo; during late night hours while others are sleeping). Even further, if a user desires to input certain time delays between commands (e.g., turning on 10 street lights at 10 minute intervals), the user can do so without waiting 100 minutes during actual operation to record such a command set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Recording without operating the track layout can be accomplished in various manners. Most simply, the transformer could be physically de-coupled, or the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could be physically de-coupled from the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be commanded, via the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, to operate under &ldquo;ignore mode&rdquo;. In &ldquo;ignore mode&rdquo;, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will receive the entered commands from the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and will save them in the flash memory <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> as discussed above, but will not forward the commands onto the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This can be effected by activating an open circuit, for example, via a transistor so that the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is electrically de-coupled from the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or the AIU <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TIU Power </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is the capability to operate with any type of power source (i.e., power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) for powering the track layout <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This capability is provided by the novel electrical configuration of the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The TIU can be configured with multiple voltage inputs and voltage outputs. The voltage inputs may be fixed and/or variable. Similarly, the voltage outputs may be fixed and/or variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is capable of receiving voltage from both DC (fixed) and AC (variable) power supplies. Thus, the SCS of the present invention can be operated by any commercial power source. Moreover, the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is capable of receiving a fixed voltage regardless of the type of power source (e.g., an AC power source connected to a fixed voltage input will be converted to DC or to a different AC value). In the same manner, a received fixed voltage input can be converted to a variable output, thereby allowing the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the present invention to control track voltage independently of the power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This allows the more archaic power sources that do not have RF capability (i.e., can not receive and transmit RF signals thereby not being capable of communicating directly with the remote control <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) to operate with the same features enjoyed using a power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with RF capability. That is, a user can alter track voltage without needing to manually adjust the power source (e.g., manipulating a throttle on the power source). Moreover, with fixed voltage power sources, like a battery, previous TIU units would require replacing the battery for every different track voltage desired, which it can be quickly appreciated is impractical to say the least. By making the appropriate connections to the TIU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the present invention, a single battery can be used while still enjoying the wide range of features of the present invention which require varying track voltage (e.g., changing speeds in legacy and conventional mode). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OPERATING EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> An example of the range of features and capabilities of the present invention will now be provided. This example is illustrative, not exhaustive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> A model train layout is connected as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A model train is placed on the track. The user turns the power source up to full and leaves it there, indicating that the user is interested in operating in &ldquo;command mode.&rdquo; Once the track is powered up, the trains automatically enter Command mode. The model train sends a data packet containing information about the model train (address, operating conditions, etc.). This information is retrieved by the user through the remote control and shown on the display unit (if desired). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Once powered up, the TIU regularly sends out a &ldquo;watchdog&rdquo; packet to the trains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> If these watchdog packets are present on the track, the trains assume that Command mode remains the default mode. In the event the train ceases to receive the watchdog packets, the train assumes the user wishes to operate in conventional mode and disables the ability to receive Command mode commands. By this feature, each model train may be selected and &ldquo;started up&rdquo; independently. All model trains equipped with the engine board <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are always &ldquo;listening&rdquo; to the track for data packets addressed to them, even when the trains appear to be dormant on the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> The user is now ready to operate the train. The user first decides to turn on and test the train lights. By either pressing a button on the remote control dedicated to a particular light control, or scrolling through the commands on the remote control displayed on the display unit, the user turns on (and/or off) the various lights located on the model train, such as the head lights, marker lights, ditch lights, beacon lights, and cab interior lights. The light functions are independent of any train movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Next, the user decides to turn the model train&apos;s engine on. This is accomplished by entering the train address and the command &ldquo;engine on&rdquo; through the remote control. The model train responds with authentic &ldquo;engine start-up&rdquo; sounds. The user now desires the train to begin to traverse the track. The user enters a scale mile-per-hour command, and, if desired, an acceleration rate at which the user wants the model train to reach the desired scale mile-per-hour. For example, if the user wants the train to very slowly reach the desired speed, the user may enter a slow acceleration rate. Conversely, the user may want the train to reach the desired speed rapidly. A fast acceleration rate will then be entered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> The train will smoothly begin to move, and will eventually reach the desired speed. Once there, the speed control circuit maintains the constant speed, even as the train goes around curves and up and down hills. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> The user may also desire that authentic sounds operate in conjunction with the desired speed. Thus, the user can enter a command that will correlate the engine &ldquo;chuff&rdquo; sound with the speed of wheel rotation. Another feature that may be correlated to the speed is the smoke output. If the train is moving slowly, the smoke output can be set to lightly puff or stream smoke (or steam) from the smokestack. If the user enters a new speed, for example, one that is faster than the previous speed, the sounds and smoke will automatically increase with the increase in speed. In other words, the engine &ldquo;chuff&rdquo; sound will become more rapid as the wheel rotation rate increases, and the amount of smoke or steam will increase, thereby simulating a harder working engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> In addition to the engine sounds, the user may desire that other sounds be played simultaneously with the engine sounds. These may be sounds that are played randomly by the engine (with a command such as &ldquo;random operating sounds&rdquo;), or manually by the user entering each appropriate sound command, or by playing a customized sound sequence pre-recorded by the user. There are numerous such sounds available. A non-exhaustive list includes bells, whistles, horns, coupler slack sounds, clickety-clack sounds, cab chatter, freight yard sounds, passenger station sounds, train announcements, break sounds, maintenance sounds, dispatcher sounds, and many more. The system also allows the user to independently control the volume of multiple sounds (for example, the user can turn down the engine chuff sound, turn up the cab chatter, mute the whistle, and leave the passenger station sounds constant). The system also provides the user with a master volume control that allows the user to turn up, down, or mute all the active sounds at once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> The next feature the user wishes to activate is the Doppler sound effect. This is a one-button command on the remote control. The train sound system then activates the Doppler sound effect and the user hears a simulation of the growing and fading sounds of a train as it approaches and passes by. The realism of the Doppler sound effect can be heightened by programming it to occur at regular intervals. By so doing, the user can &ldquo;time&rdquo; the Doppler sound effect to coincide with each pass of the train by where the user is standing, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> The user now wishes to connect the model train to a consist. The user slows the train down by entering a new speed command. All sounds and smoke appropriately coincide with the change in speed. The user then hits the &ldquo;coupler&rdquo; button on the remote control and the coupler opens on the train (a sound file plays a coupler firing sound at the same time). The user can then bring the train into contact with the consist, the coupler on the consist is joined with the coupler on the train, and the train coupler closes upon joinder. The user can then, if desired, stop the train and reverse direction (both one-button controls). The user can enter another speed, and the train will pull away with the consist in tow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> The train, however, now has to work harder to pull the consist. This is reflected in the amount of smoke or steam is output, and in the engine sounds. The model train engine board monitors the amount of work the engine is expending in order to maintain the desired speed. As the amount of work increases, the model train will activate a new engine sound file that sounds &ldquo;deeper&rdquo; and more labored than when the train is moving without a load. The model train will also cause the smoke unit to produce a greater amount of smoke or steam, commensurate with the increased work load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> The user may now decide to activate some of the accessories. For example, the user may desire to turn on the lights at all the intersections. The user enters the command previously programmed by the user on the remote control (for example, &ldquo;activate intersection lights.&rdquo; This command is passed from the remote control to the TIU to the AIU, which activates the appropriate relay corresponding to the intersection lights. The lights at all the intersections then turn on. Other accessories are controlled in a similar fashion, including layout switches, signal lights, crossing gates, and much more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> The user may now want to become the dispatcher for the train. The user presses the microphone button on the remote control. Certain sounds, such as the bell and whistle, are muted, while other sounds, such as chuffing, will remain in order to maintain a realistic operation. The user speaks into the microphone on the remote control, and the user&apos;s voice plays out the speaker on the model train, while the train moves around the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> Next, the user desires to play a CD. The user enters the &ldquo;proto-cast&rdquo; command, which tells the system that sounds from an external source will now be input. The system mutes all other sounds and waits for input from the external source (such as a CD player or computer). The sounds are played from the external source and are streamed, in real time, down the tracks where they are picked up by the model train and played out the train speaker. The user can adjust the volume using the master volume control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> When the user is ready to end his or her session, the user enters a &ldquo;stop&rdquo; command. The train smoothly decelerates to zero miles per hour and comes to a stop. The user then enters an &ldquo;engine off&rdquo; command. The train responds with a series of extended &ldquo;shutdown&rdquo; sound effects. Engine lights can be automatically turned off or turned off manually by the user. Finally, the user asks the train for the total &ldquo;scale miles&rdquo; traversed by the engine. That information is passed from the train to the remote control and displayed on the display unit. The model train processor records and maintains the total amount of mileage for each session and the total for that particular engine. Thus, the user has an accurate account of the total &ldquo;mileage&rdquo; and run time in hours on that particular train, which is useful for managing the maintenance of the train. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to its preferred embodiments. It is noted that the present invention may be embodied in other forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. For example, the novel control system of the present invention, for exemplary purposes only, has been described in terms of model trains. However, it should be appreciated that the novel control system of the present invention has applicability to a wide range of model vehicles other than model trains, including, but not limited to, cars, buses, metro rails, airplanes (e.g., on the runway, or while flying using RF signals directly between the engine board of the plane and the hand-held remote), bicycles, etc. In short, any type of model vehicle that moves and can be independently controlled by a user can utilize the novel control system of the present invention. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims, and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
