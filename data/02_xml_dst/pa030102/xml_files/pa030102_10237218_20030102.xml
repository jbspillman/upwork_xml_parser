<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method for casting or molding an article of jewelry, and more particularly, to a method for producing a bored out or hollow jewelry article such as a ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There are many well known processes used in the large volume production of jewelry. Such processes include die striking, casting and electroforming, all of which are used for producing metallic jewelry articles. Such production methods are capable of facilitating high volume, high speed production with very good reproducibility. For example, using permanent-mold casting or injection molding techniques, a single mold cavity may be used repeatedly to produce, at a low cost, a virtually unlimited number of jewelry articles of intricate detail and varying size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to reduce production costs in the manufacture of jewelry articles, previous improvements have generally focused upon better equipment; very little effort has been directed to actually modifying the jewelry article that is produced in order to reduce the cost thereof. One way, of course, of reducing production costs is to reduce the amount of precious or semi-precious metal that is used in producing a jewelry article, while still achieving the visual presentation that is desired by the jewelry designer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One such prior method involves the use of an acid or water-soluble wax insert disposed in a mold cavity in order to form a mold of a partially or completely hollow article. According to this technique, a soluble wax core insert is placed in a mold cavity. Then a molten wax is injected into the mold cavity, filling the cavity and surrounding the core insert. The core insert is then removed in order to produce a wax article having a hollow core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, the use of soluble wax core inserts has been less than desirable. In the first place, there have been difficulties in achieving proper alignment of the insert and in preventing random movement or shifting of the insert during waxing or casting. In addition, the prior art has failed to teach the use of a soluble wax core insert such that a hollow or bored out space is defined within the ring which extends virtually along the entire arcuate length thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the prior art patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,718,278 to Baum, it is stated that it is not possible to produce a ring having an inner round radius design utilizing a vertically oriented mold configuration. However, the Baum process which utilizes a horizontally oriented mold configuration is less than desirable since it is not able to produce a ring which is hollowed or bored out to an arcuate content of 200&deg; and up to or approaching 360&deg;. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, in accordance with the invention, there is provided a method or process for fabricating a hollow jewelry article which is hollowed or bored out to an arcuate extent of 200&deg; or greater. In accordance with this process, a metal ring model is prepared comprising a solid shank and a metal plate supported along the internal perimeter of the shank and arcuately extending at least 200&deg; therealong. A first metal mold is produced from the metal ring model having the external shape of the jewelry article to be manufactured. From this mold, a wax model of the jewelry article is produced which is first filed down and then cast in order to form a metal model of a core insert; the core insert, like the ring model, has a plate disposed along the perimeter of the shank. This core insert is used to produce a second metal mold. This second mold may then be used repeatedly in order to form a soluble wax core insert model which is then inserted into the cavity of the first mold in order to define the hollow region of the article. A non-soluble wax is then introduced into the first mold for completely surrounding the soluble wax core insert. The non-soluble wax then hardens and the entire unit is removed from the first mold, including the soluble wax core. The core is then removed by a suitable water soluble or chemical mechanism. The remaining wax model contains a hollow core running along a substantial portion of the arcuate length thereof. The wax model is then cast in order to form the inventive ring design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Because the ring model includes a plate supported along the internal perimeter of the shank, it is possible to produce a core insert which arcuately extends at 200&deg; or greater, thereby enabling the production of a ring or other jewelry article which is bored out or hollowed within the shank thereof to an extent for greater than what is taught by the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the invention to produce a ring design having a shank which is hollowed to an arcuate extent of at least 200&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object is to produce a ring design which uses less metal but still exhibits the same physical appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Yet a further object of the invention is to produce a ring design in which the inside surface of the shank is substantially flat with rounded edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The invention accordingly comprises the several steps and the relation of one or more of such steps with respect to each of the others thereof, as well as an article of manufacture produced by carrying out these steps, and which possesses the features, properties and relation of elements, all of which will be exemplified in the process and article hereinafter disclosed and described, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> metal ring model which is used in producing a ring mold is generally indicated at <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Metal ring model <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> consists of a shank <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a setting portion <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and an internally extending plate element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> supported along the internal perimeter of shank <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Metal ring model <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has an external shape identical to the jewelry ring that is to be produced in accordance with the invention. Shank <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> preferably has a flat finger facing surface with rounded edges. Metal plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is provided for enabling production of a core insert with a supporting plate and for thereby defining the extent to which the shank of the ring to be produced is hollowed or bored out, as described. Metal ring model <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is used, as is well known in the art, to then prepare a vertically oriented mold thereof, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A, a metal ring mold produced from metal ring model <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is generally indicated at <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Ring mold <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is vertically oriented and includes a pair of metal die elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a pair of metal split side mold inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and a metal crown mold insert <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in order to define, when assembled (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 9</cross-reference>A), a cavity that is shaped like metal ring model <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> To facilitate proper alignment and assembly of die elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, locator pins <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are provided along die element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for fitting into corresponding locator holes <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> formed along die element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Die elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> also define an inlet port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for injecting wax thereinto, as later described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, crown mold insert <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has a head portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and a shoulder portion <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Head portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> has a pair of locator plugs <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> (one is not shown) which are sized to be receivingly engaged within locator holes <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> respectively of die elements <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in order to properly align crown mold insert <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> inside of mold <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In addition, shoulder portion <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> includes a series of protuberances <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on one side thereof for selective engagement within openings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> formed along die element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&mdash;this further facilitates proper fitting of crown mold insert <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> inside mold <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Each of side inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are cylindrically shaped and include inwardly directed top surfaces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A and outside radial surfaces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B. Top inside surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A of side insert <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is formed with a pair of locator pins <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and a pair of locator holes <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> for selectively and cooperatively engaging with corresponding holes and pins (not shown) formed along the top inside surface of side insert <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Because of their design, side inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, when mated together, define a space or cavity <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>) of a configuration that is shaped like that of metal ring model <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Radial surfaces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B of mold inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are also formed with protuberances <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> (for insert <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> (for insert <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>). These protuberances are selectively received in holes <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (of die element <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> (of die element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>) in order to cooperatively retain inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in proper position within mold <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Once mold <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is fully assembled, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference>A, wax is injected therein through inlet port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in order to produce a wax model <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the ring, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Wax model <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> includes a shank <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, a setting region <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and an insert element <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> supported along the internal perimeter of shank <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>; it also includes an extending sprew <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. After cutting off sprew <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, shank <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of ring wax model <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is filed down, after which model <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is cast in order to produce a metal core insert model <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Metal core insert model <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, like metal ring model <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, includes a shank <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, a setting region <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and a plate element <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> supported along the internal perimeter of shank <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Significantly, metal core insert model <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> has a slightly smaller but nonetheless identical external shape to that of metal ring model <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. From metal insert model <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, using processes well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, a metal core insert mold, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Core insert mold <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, used to form a core insert, as described below, is of a somewhat similar construction to that of ring mold <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and includes a first metal die element <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, and a second metal die element <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, which together when assembled define a core cavity <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Die element <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> includes a pair of locator pins <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> which are designed to be matingly engaged with locator holes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in order to place mold <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> in a desired closed assembled condition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Die element <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> further includes a pair of centrally disposed cavity locator pins <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which are received in holes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> formed along die element <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> in order to provide separation between die elements <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and thus define cavity <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Mold <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is also provided with an inlet port <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for injection of soluble wax into mold <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> in order to form a soluble wax model <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of the core insert, as shown at <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Core insert wax model <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is produced following injection of soluble wax through port <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and into core insert mold <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. As can be appreciated, soluble wax model <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> has the same shape, but is slightly smaller than, the shape of ring wax model <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Core insert wax model <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> includes a shank <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, a setting region <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, and an insert element <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> supported along the internal perimeter of shank <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> To fabricate the inventive ring (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), core insert wax model <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is placed inside ring mold <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 9</cross-reference>A and positioned between first and second side mold inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and under crown mold insert <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Because core insert wax model <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is somewhat smaller in size than the ring to be produced, a gap is defined in cavity <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and between first and second side mold inserts <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and below crown mold insert <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>). This gap defines the thickness of the shank wall of the final ring product, as discussed later. This gap is adjustable in size depending upon the extent to which the ring wax model is filed down in order to produce metal core insert model <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, as discussed before. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Once core insert wax model <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is precisely positioned within ring mold <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, mold <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is closed and a molten wax is introduced through port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and into ring mold <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, thereby filling the mold cavity and completely surrounding core insert wax model <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. After hardening, a wax article <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is produced and then removed from mold cavity <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in ring mold <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with core insert wax model <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> intact. Wax model <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is then eliminated from article <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by applying a water soluble or another chemical mechanism, as is well known in the art, thereby leaving behind a non-soluble wax replica or component <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the inventive ring. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is most relevant here, since it illustrates both the non-soluble <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and soluble <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> components which make up plastic article <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that is produced at this stage in the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Non-soluble component <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is used to produce a cast metal ring generally indicated at <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>. This is achieved by one of many well known methods known to those of skill in the art, such as the lost wax investment casting method. As can be appreciated, the final finished ring, as indicated at <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, includes a shank <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> defined by a wall <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and setting portion <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. Ring <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is formed with an arcuately extending opening <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> along a substantial portion of finger facing surface <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of shank <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> leading to an internal arcuately running hollow cavity <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). A small portion of finger facing surface <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> does not include opening <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, and may be used for jewelry stamping requirements or jewelry sizing needs, as is known. Significantly, in order to enhance comfort when wearing ring <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, shank <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) has finger facing surface <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> being flat with slightly rounded edges <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, the arcuate range of cavity <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of ring <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> obtainable under the current invention is on the order of 200&deg; to 360&deg;. This is because ring <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is produced by first preparing a ring model having a plate supported along the internal perimeter of the shank, which enables production of a core insert that extends at least 200&deg;. In contrast, prior art techniques can only attain an arcuate range of hollowness of no greater than 160&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Importantly, wall <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of shank <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> has a thickness of between 0.017 and 0.030 inch. The preferred thickness of wall <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is 0.020-0.22 inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained by practicing the invention and it is also understood the invention includes any and all changes or modifications thereto which would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art and which come within the spirit and scope of the inventive concept. </paragraph>
