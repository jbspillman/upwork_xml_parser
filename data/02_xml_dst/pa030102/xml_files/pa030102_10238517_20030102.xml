<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An optical disc drive equipped with a TLN signal generating apparatus is disclosed. The TLN signal generating apparatus includes a TLN signal generating circuit for generating a TLN signal (track loss signal) based on signals obtained from an optical pick-up; a digitizing circuit for digitizing the TLN signal by comparing it with a reference level; and a correction circuit for correcting the TLN signal so that it is accurately digitized by the digitizing circuit irrespective of an offset component which is a direct current component contained in the TLN signal. The correction circuit is comprised of an offset component detecting circuit for detecting a level of the offset component contained in the TLN signal; and a signal control circuit for controlling, responsive to the level of the offset component detected by the offset component detecting circuit, a level of the TLN signal generated by the TLN signal generating circuit so that the level of the TLN signal will become a level which does not receive any influence from the level of the direct component. The correction circuit can also be comprised of a signal correcting circuit which amplifies an alternating current component contained in the TLN signal without eliminating a directed current component contained in the TLN signal. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a TLN signal generating apparatus used in an optical disc drive for playing back or recording and playing back an optical disc and an optical disc drive equipped with the TLN signal generating apparatus, and also relates to an optical disc drive equipped with an amplitude adjusting apparatus for a tracking error signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Optical discs including read-only type optical discs such as an audio CD (compact disc) and a CD-ROM and recordable type optical discs such as a CD-R or the like are driven by optical disc drives. These optical disc drives are normally equipped with an optical pick-up which is movable along a radial direction of an optical disc and a sled motor for moving the optical disc in the radial direction thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The optical pick-up includes an optical pick-up body equipped with a laser diode and a split photodiode, an objective lens which is supported by the pick-up body by means of suspension springs so as to be freely movable in the radial direction of the optical disc as well as the rotation axial direction thereof, and an actuator for moving the objective lens in the radial direction as well as the axial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In these optical disc drives, data recorded on the optical disc in a spiral manner is reproduced by moving the optical pick-up in the radial direction so as to follow the track while rotating the optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When the optical pick-up is to be moved to a predetermined track on the optical disc, a track jump control is carried out. For example, when a predetermined music number (e.g. a third music) is selected, the optical pick-up is moved to the predetermined track automatically through the track jump control, thereby enabling to playback the selected music immediately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The track jump performed in the optical disc drive generally includes a rough search and a fine search. The rough search is used to jump the optical pick-up to a track which is relatively far away from the present position of the optical pick-up, while the fine search is used to jump the optical pick-up to a relatively close track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, an explanation is made with regard to the operation of the fine search. In this connection, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> is a schematic drawing which shows pre-grooves (WOBBLE) <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed in an optical disc and lands <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed between of the pre-grooves. Information (data) is recorded in the pre-grooves <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, that is pits are formed in the pre-grooves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A laser beam (comprised of a main beam and a sub-beam) which is emitted from the laser diode is reflected on the pre-grooves <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the lands <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and then the reflected beam <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is received by the split photodiode and then converted into electrical signals. Various signals such as a track loss signal (hereinafter, referred to as &ldquo;TLN signal&rdquo;, details of which will be explained later) and a tracking error signal and the like are produced based on the electrical signals produced by the optical pick-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When a fine search is to be carried out, the optical pick-up is moved to the radial direction of the optical disc (the direction indicated by the arrow &ldquo;Y&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>). Therefore, the optical pick-up traverses the pre-grooves and the lands alternately. In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, the TNL signal has a waveform in which the level of the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> raises when the main beam traverses portions defined by the pre-grooves <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the level thereof decreases when the main beam traverses portions defined by the lands <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when a track jump is to be carried out during the fine search, the number of tracks to be jumped can be obtained by counting peaks of the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In more details, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37, a</cross-reference> predetermined reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is pre-set, and a TLN signal is digitized based on the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, by counting the number that the digitized TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> exceeds the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it is possible to carry out a track jump to a predetermined track. For example, in the case where a command that moves the optical pick-up for ten tracks is given, the optical pick-up is being moved until the TLN signal obtained from the received beam exceeds the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for ten times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, actually, the waveform of the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not have the same amplitudes in the up and down directions with respect to the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and it has an offset component (direct current component). For this reason, the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is oscillated with respect to a level L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is sifted for a predetermined value from the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The offset component varies depending on various factors such as ambient temperature, deterioration due to elapse of time, tilting degree of the optical pick-up (improper skew adjustment), and loading condition of the optical disc or the like. Therefore, in the case where the offset component is large, there is a case that the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not exceed (cross) the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> even though the TLN signal is being actually oscillated. In such a case, it is not possible to digitize the TLN signal correctly. With this result, there arises a problem that it is not possible to move the optical pick-up to the designated track, because any one or more of tracks can not be counted during the fine search even though the optical pick-up has actually traversed them. In particular, in the case of CD-R and CD-RW and the like in which no data has yet been recorded, amplitude of TLN signal obtained therefrom is quite small, so that influence from the offset component contained in the TLN signal is relatively large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further, in recent years, various optical discs such as CD-R, CD-ROM, CD-RW have been developed and then widely used. Therefore, it is desired that it is possible to playback and record these optical discs with a single optical disc drive in a compatible manner. However, since the reflectances of the reflective layers of CD-R, CD-ROM and CD-RW are different from each other, the tracking error signals obtained from these optical discs are also different from each other. Further, even among the optical discs of the same type, there is a case that amplitudes of tracking error signals are different from each other due to individual differences of the respective optical discs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Specifically, in the case where an amplitude of a tracking error signal reproduced from a data disc of CD-R (having pre-pits) is supposed to be 1, an amplitude of a tracking error signal reproduced from a data disc of CD-ROM is approximate to 0.7 and an amplitude of a tracking error signal reproduced from a data disc of CD-WR is approximate to 3.5, respectively. Therefore, if amplitude adjustment would not be performed so as to meet the respective disc, a tracking servo will not be engaged properly, thus making it difficult to perform accurate recording and playing back control. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a TLN signal generating apparatus used in an optical disc drive and an optical disc drive equipped with the apparatus which can accurately and reliably grasp the position of the optical pick up with respect to the optical disc during the movement of the optical pick-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide an optical disc drive equipped with an amplitude adjusting apparatus for a tracking error signal which can adjust the amplitude of the tracking error signal in an optimum condition irrespective of types of optical discs and individual differences between optical discs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the object, the present invention is directed to an optical disc drive equipped with a TLN signal generating apparatus, in which the TLN signal generating apparatus comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> TLN signal generating means for generating a TLN signal (track loss signal) based on signals obtained from an optical pick-up; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> a digitizing circuit for digitizing the TLN signal generated by the TLN signal generating means by comparing it with a reference level; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> correction means for correcting the TLN signal generated by the TLN signal generating means so that it is accurately digitized by the digitizing circuit irrespective of an offset component which is a direct current component contained in the TLN signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to the optical disc drive described above, it is possible to digitize the TLN signal accurately without receiving any influence from the offset component contained in the TLN signal. Therefore, in the case where the optical pick-up is moved to a target track by grasping the radial position of the optical pick-up relative to the optical disc based on the TLN signal, it is possible to accurately count the number of tracks above which the optical pick-up has passed, so that it becomes possible to move the optical pickup to the target track accurately. This is particularly effective where optical discs such as CD-R and CD-RW from which a small amplitude TLN signal is obtained are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In this optical disc drive, it is preferred that the correction means includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> offset component detecting means for detecting a level of the offset component contained in the TLN signal; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> signal control means for controlling, responsive to the level of the offset component detected by the offset component detecting means, a level of the TLN signal generated by the TLN signal generating means so that the level of the TLN signal will become a level which does not receive any influence from the level of the direct component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Further, in this case, it is more preferable that the signal control means controls, responsive to the level of the offset component detected by the offset component detecting means, a level of the TLN signal generated by the TLN signal generating means so that the offset component is decreased or eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is also preferred that the offset component detecting means is constructed so as to detect a peak value and a bottom value of the TLN signal generated by the TLN signal generating means and then obtain the level of the offset component based on the peak and bottom values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In this case, it is preferred that the offset component detecting means is constructed so as to detect a median value between a peak value and a bottom value of the TLN signal generated by the TLN signal generating means or a value calculated based on the median value as the level of the offset component. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Further, it is also preferred that the offset component detecting means is constructed so as to detect a median value between a peak value and a bottom value of the TLN signal generated by the TLN signal generating means or a value calculated based on the median value as the level of the offset component. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In the EFM/CD-ROM encoder control section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such data is encoded in response to a clock signal (i.e., at the timing of the clock signal) from the clock <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and then undergoes modulation (EFM modulation) by a modulation method known as EFM (Eight to Fourteen Modulation) to form ENCODE EFM signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, these ENCODE EFM signals are formed from pulses each having a predetermined length (period) of any one of 3T-11T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, in the EFM/CD-ROM encoder control section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the clock signal from the clock <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is divided, and a SUBCODE-SYNC signal composed of pulses having a predetermined period is generated. The pulse period of this SUBCODE-SYNC signal (i.e., the time interval between adjacent pulses) is {fraction (1/75)} second for the case of the reference rotation speed (1&times;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> During the encoding described above, a synchronizing signal, that is a SYNC pattern is added to the ENCODE EFM signal based on the SUBCODE-SYNC signal (i.e., on the timing of the SUBCODE-SYNC signal). Namely, the SYNC pattern is respectively added to a portion corresponding to the head portion of each SUBCODE frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> This ENCODE EFM signal is inputted into the laser control section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the EFM/CD-ROM encoder control section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Based on the ENCODE EFM signal, the laser control section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> switches the level of the WRITE POWER signal from the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between a high level (H) and a low level (L), and then outputs such signal, thereby controlling the operations of the laser diode of the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In particular, during the period of time in which the ENCODE EFM signal is in a high (H) level, the laser control section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> outputs a high level (H) WRITE POWER signal. Namely, the laser output is increased (to a level for writing in data). Then, during the period of time in which the ENCODE EFM signal is in a low (L) level, the laser control section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> outputs a low level (L) WRITE POWER signal. Namely, the laser output is decreased (returned to a level for reading out data). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the ENCODE EFM signal level is in the high (H) level, a pit having a predetermined length is formed in the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and when the ENCODE EFM signal level is in the low (L) level, a land having a predetermined length is formed in the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Further, when the trial writing to a test area is carried out under the OPC procedure, WRITE POWER signals of 15-step levels are generated in the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and these WRITE POWER signals are outputted from the D/A converter (not shown in the drawings) provided in the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and then inputted into the laser control section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Then, based on the random EFM signal, the laser control section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> switches the level of the WRITE POWER signals from the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between a high level (H) and a low level (L), and then outputs such signals, thereby controlling the operations of the laser diode of the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This is done for each of the 15-step level WRITE POWER signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In this way, under the OPC procedure, trial writing to a test area can be carried out with laser light having 15-step output levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Further, when writing data in the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, laser light at a read-out output level is emitted from the laser diode of the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> onto the pre-groove of the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the light reflected therefrom is received by the split photodiode of the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The WOBBLE signal having a waveform shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is outputted from this split photodiode. As was mentioned above, the WOBBLE signal includes the 22.95 kHz signal at the reference rotation speed (1&times;) and the signal obtained by biphase modulating the ATIP information and further frequency-modulating it at a carrier frequency of 22.05 kHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> This WOBBLE signal is inputted into the WOBBLE signal detection circuit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, where it undergoes digitization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The digitized WOBBLE signal is then inputted into the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the frequency-modulated ATIP information in the WOBBLE signal is demodulated to obtain the BIDATA signal (biphase signal) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. This BIDATA signal is a pulse signal having a length of any one of 1T-3T. Further, by biphase demodulating and then decoding this BIDATA signal, it is possible to obtain the ATIP information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Further, in a digital PLL circuit (not shown in the drawings) provided in the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a clock is generated based on the BIDATA signal to obtain the BICLOCK signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. This BICLOCK signal is used for timing for decoding the BIDATA signal (described later). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The BIDATA signal and the BICLOCK signal are respectively inputted into the SYNC signal generating/ATIP decoder <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In the SYNC signal generating/ATIP decoder <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the BIDATA signal is biphase demodulated based on the BICLOCK signal, and the biphase demodulated BIDATA signal is then decoded to obtain the ATIP information. Further, the ATIP-SYNC signal (used as the first synchronizing signal) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is also generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the ATIP-SYNC signal pulse is generated when the SYNC pattern included in the BIDATA signal is detected. The period of this ATIP-SYNC signal pulse (i.e., the time interval between adjacent pulses) is {fraction (1/75)} second for the case of the reference rotation speed (1&times;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> This ATIP-SYNC signal is inputted into the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Further, the decoded ATIP information is inputted into the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In this way, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can obtain information concerning a specific position on the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (the absolute time) from this ATIP information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned SUBCODE-SYNC signal from the EFM/CD-ROM encoder control section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is inputted into the SYNC signal generating/ATIP decoder <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, after which such SUBCODE-SYNC signal is respectively inputted into the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the SYNC signal generating/ATIP decoder <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a chart showing the frame format of the ATIP frame. As shown in this drawing, the frame format of one ATIP frame is comprised of 4-bits for synchronizing signal (Sync); 8-bits for minutes (Min); 8-bits for seconds (Sec); 8-bits for frames (Frame); and 14-bits for error detection code (CRC: Cyclic Redundancy Code). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the ATIP information of each of the ATIP frames undergoes an error detection process (to determine whether or not the ATIP information is wrong). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In this ATIP information error detection process, if the results of a predetermined operation performed on the data of the Sync, Minutes, Seconds and other data of the ATIP frame match the error detection code (CRC), such a state is defined as a &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, and if the results don&apos;t match the error detection code, such a state is defined as a &ldquo;ATIP error&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In this case, if it is found that the ATIP information is wrong, namely if an ATIP error is detected, a pulse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> will be generated in the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as an ATIP error signal, and then it is outputted, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The ATIP error signal which is formed from the pulse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is inputted into a counter (counting means) <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> provided in the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Then, the number of the pulses of the ATIP error signal is counted by the counter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, and the number of the pulses of the ATIP error signal is defined as the number of ATIP errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In this regard, because this error detection process is carried out on the ATIP information for each ATIP frame, a maximum of 75 ATIP errors can occur in 75 ATIP frames (in one second at the reference rotation speed (1&times;)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In this connection, a detection means for detecting such ATIP errors is constructed from the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The counted value of the ATIP error is stored in the memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and is also transmitted to the computer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> via the interface control section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be utilized in examining the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (to judge the recording performance of the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The ATIP-SYNC signal inputted into the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is utilized to the timing of renewal of ATIP time information. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The SUBCODE-SYNC signal inputted into the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is utilized for compensation (interpolation) of the ATIP time information and the measurement of the ATIP error described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Further, the SUBCODE-SYNC signal inputted into the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is utilized as a reference signal for synchronization in the same manner as the ATIP-SYNC signal described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In this connection, the synchronization is carried out such that the timing of the SUBCODE-SYNC signal in the EFM data generated when writing data becomes substantially synchronized with the timing of the ATIP-SYNC signal obtained from the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the SUBCODE-SYNC signal and the ATIP-SYNC signal are normally allowed to shift up to&plusmn;2 EFM frames to each other at the respective position on the entire optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> When data (signals) are to be played back (read out) from the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the level of the WRITE POWER signal supplied from the laser control section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is maintained at a predetermined DC level corresponding to a read-out output, and in this way, the laser output is maintained at the read-out output level. Normally, the read-out output (the output of the main beam) is set to be equal to or less than 0.7 mW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when data is being read out from the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, laser light at the read-out output level is emitted from the laser diode of the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> onto a predetermined track of the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the light reflected therefrom is received by the split photodiode of the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Then, electrical currents (voltages) corresponding to the quantity of received light are outputted respectively from each light-receiving portion of the split photodiode of the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and these currents, namely, each signal (detection signal) is respectively inputted into the HF signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the PU drive and control signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> In the HF signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, these detection signals undergo addition, subtraction and the like to generate an HF (RF) signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> This HF signal is an analog signal corresponding to pits and lands formed in the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> As described above, this HF signal is inputted into the HF signal gain switching circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and then amplified. The amplification factor (gain) of the HF signal gain switching circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is switched by a gain switching signal supplied from the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> These PEAK and BOTTOM signals are used, for example, to measure the amplitude, to adjust the amplitude of the tracking error signal, to calculate the &bgr; value in the OPC (Optimum Power Control) procedure, and to determine the presence or absence of the HF signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> In the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the HF signal is digitized and then EFM demodulated to obtain an EFM signal. This EFM signal is a signal formed by a pulse having a length (period) corresponding to any one of 3T-11T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Then, in the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an error correction (CIRC error correction) which uses an error correction code referred to as a CIRC (Cross Interleaved Read Solomon Code) is carried out twice on this EFM signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In this case, the first CIRC correction is referred to as a &ldquo;C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> error correction&rdquo;, and the second CIRC correction is referred to as a &ldquo;C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> error correction&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Further, the case where error correction can not be carried out by the first CIRC correction, that is by the C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> error correction, is referred to as a &ldquo;C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> error&rdquo;, and the case where error correction can not be carried out by the second CIRC correction, that is by the C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> error correction&rdquo; is referred to as a &ldquo;C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> error&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, if a C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> error is detected in the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> during the C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> error correction, a pulse <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is generated and then it is outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> error signal comprised of the pulses <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is inputted into the counter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Then, the number of the pulses of the C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> error signal is counted (measured) by the counter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> as the number of C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Now, because one subcode frame is comprised of 98 EFM frames, a maximum number of 7350 C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> errors can occur respectively in 75 subcode frames (in one second at the reference rotation speed (1&times;)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In this regard, it is to be understood that the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> constitutes a detection means for detecting the C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The counted value of C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> errors is stored in the memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and is also transmitted to the computer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> via the interface control section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be utilized in examining the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (to judge the playback performance or the recording/playback performance of the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the EFM signal after CIRC error correction has been carried out is decoded (converted) into a predetermined format data, namely a DATA signal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Further, in the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the BITCLOCK signal and the LRCLOCK signal are respectively generated based on the clock signal from the clock <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> This BITCLOCK signal is a serial data transfer clock. Further, the LRCLOCK signal is a signal for discriminating the L-channel data and the R-channel data in the DATA signal. In this case, the high (H) level of the LRCLOCK signal represents the L-channel data, and the low (L) level of the LRCLOCK signal represents the R-channel data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Now, in the case where normal data other than audio data is recorded on the optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the EFM signal thereof is also decoded into a DATA signal comprised of the above-mentioned 16-bit L-channel data and 16-bit R-channel data. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> This ECC/EDC is an error correction code used in a CD-ROM MODE <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> format. With this error correction, it is possible to reduce the bit error rate to a degree of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;12</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Next, in the CD-ROM decoder control section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the DATA signal is decoded into predetermined format data for communication (transmission) based on the clock signal from the clock <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and this decoded data is then transmitted to the computer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> via the interface control section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Further, if no HF signal becomes inputted (i.e., if the EFM signal becomes unsynchronized with the specified period), the level of the FRAME SYNC signal is switched from a high (H) level to a low (L) level at the respective EFM frame unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> In this regard, it is to be understood that, in the case of the reference rotation speed (1&times;), the length (period) of one EFM frame is 136 &mgr;sec, and 98 EFM frames form one subcode frame. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> In this connection, because each of P-W data is comprised of one bit, respectively, and one subcode frame is comprised of 98 EFM frames, there are a total of 98 bits for each P-W data in one subcode frame. However, because the first two EFM frames are used for the SYNC pattern (synchronization signal), there are actually 96 bits for each P-W data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Next, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a chart showing the format of the 96 bits of Q data.

Further, the SYNC pattern is outputted 75 times every second in the case of the reference rotation speed (1&times;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Further, in the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the Q data is renewed after the SUBCODE-SYNC signal pulse has been detected.

<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> The reflected beam reflected from the pre-groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is received at the light receiving portions <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the split photodiode, and then detected signals a, b, c and d each having a level corresponding to the quantity of the received light are outputted from the respective light receiving portions <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Further, the reflected light of the sub-beam from the land <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is received at the light receiving portions <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the split photodiode, and then detected signals e and f each having a level corresponding to the quantity of the received light are outputted from the light receiving portions <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the reflected light of the sub-beam from the land <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is received at the light receiving portions <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the split photodiode, and then detected signals e and f each having a level corresponding to the quantity of the received light are outputted from the light receiving portions <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The TE signal is represented by the following Equation (1). Here, k is a constant. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> When the main beam is positioned at the center of the pre-groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or the center of each land <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the above Equation is ((a&plus;d)&minus;(b&plus;c))&equals;k&lcub;(e&plus;g)&minus;(f&plus;h)&rcub;, so that the level of the TE signal becomes zero (zero level). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> When the rough search is to be carried out, the sled motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is driven to move the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the radial direction, so that the laser beam emitted from the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> traverse the pre-groove and land alternately such as an order of pre-groove, land, pre-groove. The reflectance of the laser beam of the pre-groove is lower than that of the land, the quantity of the light reflected on the land is less than the quantity of the light reflected on the pre-groove. For this reason, the TE signal given by the Equation (1) becomes a signal having a waveform shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in accordance with the displacement in the radial direction, and a wave of one wavelength (one cycle) is produced every time upon passing of the optical pick-up above one pre-groove, that is one track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Therefore, by counting the number of peaks or bottoms of the TE signal with a counter (not shown in the drawing) incorporated in the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, it is possible to know the number of pre-grooves, that is the number of tracks above which the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has passed, thereby making it possible to move the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the target track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> For example, when the optical pick-up is to be moved for 1000 tracks through the rough search, the sled motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is driven to move the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and at the same time the number of peaks and bottoms of the TE signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is counted, and then the sled motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is stopped when the counted number reaches at 1000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be made with regard to the fine search. In the fine search, the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> send a driving signal to the second driver <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> while grasping the radial position of the optical pick-up (objective lens) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> based on the TLN signal and the moving direction of the optical pick-up (objective lens) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> based on the TE signal (phase difference between the TE signal and the TLN signal). In this way, a control signal is fed to the actuator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the second driver <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, so that the actuator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is driven to move the objective lens in the radial direction. Further, the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> controls the driving of the sled motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the first driver <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> such that the optical pick-up body follows the objective lens. In this way, the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is moved to the target track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> The TLN signal is represented by the following Equation (2). Here, k&prime; is a constant. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> When the main beam is positioned at the center of the pre-groove <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the value of the first term (a&plus;b&plus;c&plus;d) at the right side of the equation becomes maximum, while the value of the second term (e&plus;f&plus;g&plus;h) becomes minimum, so that the level of the TLN signal becomes maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> As the main beam is being far away from the center of the pre-groove, the level of the TLN signal becomes small. When the main beam becomes positioned at the center of the land, the level of the TLN signal becomes minimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is moved into the radial direction, the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes a signal having a waveform which is changed (oscillated) substantially in a predetermined cycle as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. In this TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a wave of one wavelength (one cycle) is produced every time upon passing of the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> above one pre-groove, that is one track. Namely, since the number of bottoms (waves) of the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponds to the number of tracks (the number of pre-grooves) above which the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has passed. Therefore, by counting the number of peaks by a counter (not shown in the drawing) incorporated in the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, it is possible to know the number of pre-grooves (the number of tracks) above which the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has passed, thereby making it possible to move the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the designated track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> For example, when the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is to be moved for <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> tracks through the fine search, the actuator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the sled motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are driven to move the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and at the same time the number of peaks of the TLN signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is counted, and then the actuator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the sled motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are stopped such that the counted value becomes <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> (5) Rotation Number Control (Rotation Speed Control) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> In the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the rotation number (rotation speed) of the spindle motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is controlled during recording or playback for instance so that the linear velocity becomes constant. The rotation number control can be achieved by the methods include a method using a WOBBLE PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal, namely, a spindle servo (WOBBLE servo) which uses the WOBBLE signal; a method using an FG PWM signal, namely, a spindle servo (FG servo) which uses an FG signal; and a method using an EFM PWM signal, namely, a spindle servo (EFM servo) which uses the EFM signal. These will be described below in the order mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> The WOBBLE PWM signal is a signal for controlling the spindle motor, and it is generated by the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The WOBBLE PWM signal is a digital signal (continuous pulse) having a level of 0-5V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> This WOBBLE PWM signal is inputted into the PWM signal smoothing filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and undergoes smoothing in the PWM signal smoothing filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, namely, the WOBBLE PWM signal is converted into a control voltage (control signal), and it is then inputted into the driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, based on such control voltage, the driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> rotationally drives the spindle motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> In this case, the WOBBLE servo controller <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adjusts the pulse width (duty ratio) of the WOBBLE PWM signal so that the frequency (period) of the WOBBLE signal becomes the target value (e.g., 22.05 kHz at the reference rotation speed (1&times;)). In this way, the spindle servo is engaged to set the rotation number (rotation speed) of the spindle motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at the target value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> The FG PWM signal is a signal for controlling the spindle motor, and it is generated by the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The FG PWM signal is a digital signal (continuous pulse) having a level of 0-5V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> This FG PWM signal is inputted into the PWM signal smoothing filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and undergoes smoothing in the PWM signal smoothing filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, namely, the FG PWM signal is converted into a control voltage (control signal), and it is then inputted into the driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, based on such control voltage, the driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> rotationally drives the spindle motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a FG (Frequency Generator) signal corresponding to the rotation number (rotation speed) of the spindle motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is outputted from the Hall element <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. This FG signal is digitized by the FG signal digitization circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and such a digitized signal is then inputted into a frequency measurement (period measurement) section (not shown in the drawings) of the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> In the frequency measurement section of the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the frequency (period) of the FG signal is measured based on the clock signal from the clock <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Then, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> adjusts the pulse width (duty ratio) of the FG PWM signal so that the frequency (period) of the FG signal becomes the target value. In this way, the spindle servo is engaged to set the rotation number (rotation speed) of the spindle motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at the target value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> The EFM PWM signal is a signal for controlling the spindle motor, and it is generated by the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The EFM PWM signal is a digital signal (continuous pulse) having a level of 0-5V level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> This EFM PWM signal is inputted into the PWM signal smoothing filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and undergoes smoothing in the PWM signal smoothing filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, namely, the EFM PWM signal is converted into a control voltage (control signal), and it is then inputted into the driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, based on such control voltage, the driver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> rotationally drives the spindle motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In this case, the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> adjusts the pulse width (duty ratio) of the EFM signal so that the EFM signal, that is a period of a predetermined pulse selected from the 3T-11T period pulses becomes the target value in anywhere on the optical disc. In this way, the spindle servo is engaged to set the rotation number (rotation speed) of the spindle motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> at the target value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, the operations in a fine search will be described in details. As described above, when the fine search it to be carried out, the radial position of the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is grasped by counting the number of bottoms of the TLN signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> so that the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be moved to the target track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> In this case, as described above, a reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is preset. Then, the TLN signal is digitized by comparing the level of the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, by counting the number of pulses of the digitized TLN signal, it is possible to detect how many tracks have been traversed during the fine search (track jump). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> (6) Eccentric Component Producing Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> As described hereinbelow, in this optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an amplitude adjustment for the tracking error signal and an offset adjustment for the TLN signal are carried out, respectively. When these adjustments are to be carried out, it is required to hold peaks and bottoms of the tracking error signal and the TLN signal stably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> In order to stably hold the peaks and bottoms of the tracking error signal and TLN signal, it is preferred that the interval of the adjacent waves (peaks or bottoms) is narrow and that the interval of the adjacent waves (peaks or bottoms) of the TLN signal is narrow. In this case, in the case of optical discs having larger eccentric components, the interval between the waves of the tracking error signal and the interval between the waves of the TLN signal become narrow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> However, among various types of optical discs, there is one having less eccentric component. For example, CD-R has less eccentric component. In the case of such an optical disc having less eccentric component, the interval of the waves of the tracking error signal and the interval of the TLN signal are relatively wide. Therefore, it is difficult to hold the peaks and bottoms of the tracking error signal and the TLN signal stably, thus leading to poor accuracy in the amplitude adjustment and the offset adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> For this reason, in the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention, when the amplitude adjustment of the tracking error signal and/or the offset adjustment of the TLN signal are to be carried out after the focus servo has been engaged, the tracking actuator is actuated to perform a beam scanning in the radial direction of the disc so that the interval between the waves of the tracking error signal and the interval between the waves of the TLN signal become narrow, and the amplitude adjustment and the offset adjustment are carried out under this state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a circuit configuration of an eccentric component generating apparatus provided in the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the eccentric component generating apparatus is generally comprised of a pulse signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which generates a predetermined pulse signal, a three-state buffer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which outputs a predetermined pulse signal supplied from the pulse signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> when the amplitude adjustment of the tracking error signal and the offset adjustment of the TLN signal are to be carried out after the focus servo has been engaged, and a driving system for the tracking actuator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> An enable terminal of the three-state buffer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. When the amplitude adjustment of the tracking error signal and the offset adjustment of the TLN signal are to be carried out by the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> after the focus servo has been engaged, the three-state buffer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is changed into an enable state, thereby a pulse signal is outputted from the pulse signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through the three-state buffer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the driving system of the tracking actuator is generally comprised of a CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which is constructed from e.g. a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) which outputs a first tracking PWM signal (TR(&plus;)) for carrying out a beam scanning toward the outer circumferential direction of the optical disc and a second tracking PWM signal (TR(&minus;)) for carrying out a beam scanning toward the inner circumferential direction, a first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for driving a tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a second differential amplifier (buffer) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a third differential amplifier <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> An output terminal of the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which outputs the first tracking PWM signal is connected to an inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> through a resister R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An output terminal of the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which outputs the second tracking PWM signal is connected to a non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> through an integrating circuit which is constructed from resistors R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An output terminal of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is connected to a non-inverting terminal of the second differential amplifier <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and it is also connected to an inverting input terminal of the third amplifier <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> through a resister R<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Further, an output of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is also returned to the inverting input terminal in a feedback manner through an integrated circuit which is constructed from resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> An output terminal of the second amplifier <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connected to its inverting input terminal in a feedback manner as well as connected to one end of the tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. An output terminal of the third differential amplifier <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is connected to its inverting input terminal in a feedback manner through a resister R<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and it is also connected to the other end of the tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Further, a reference voltage (Vref) is applied to the non-inverting input terminal of the third amplifier <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> through a resistor R<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> In connection with the driving system for the tracking actuator described above, the output terminal of the three-states buffer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> so that the pulse signal fed from the pulse signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is supplied to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> when the amplitude adjustment of the tracking error signal and the offset adjustment of the TLN signal are to be carried out by the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> after the focus servo has been engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> In this regard, it is to be noted that the resisters R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the resisters R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are also used to realize a part of the PWM signal smoothing circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (which is a circuit for smoothing the first tracking PWM signal and the second tracking PWM signal). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, an explanation is made with regard to the operation of the eccentric component generating apparatus. In this eccentric component generating apparatus, when for example a beam scanning toward the outer circumferential direction of an optical disc is to be carried out, the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> sets the pulse width of the first tracking PWM signal (TR(&plus;)) so as to be relatively wider than the pulse width of the second tracking PWM signal (TR(&minus;)), and then supplies these PWM signals to the inverting input terminal and the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, respectively. In this way, the minus difference at the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> becomes large, and an output of such a state is supplied to the tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through the second and third amplifiers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, so that the tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is driven so as to perform a beam scanning toward the outer circumferential direction of the disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when a beam scanning toward the inner circumferential direction is to be performed, the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> sets the pulse width of the second tracking PWM signal (TR(&minus;)) so as to be relatively wider than the pulse width of the first tracking PWM signal (TR(&minus;)), and then supplies these PWM signals to the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, respectively. In this way, the plus difference at the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> becomes large, and an output of such a state is supplied to the tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through the second and third amplifiers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, so that the tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is driven so as to perform a beam scanning toward the inner circumferential direction of the disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> The above described driving control for the tracking actuator is a driving control which is normally carried out at a seek time or the like. However, when the amplitude adjustment for the tracking error signal and the offset adjustment for the TLN signal are to be carried out after a focus servo has been engaged, the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> produces first and second tracking PWM signals which have the same pulse width and the same phase, respectively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), and then supplies these signals to the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in this case, since there is no difference between the respective PWM signals at the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the tracking actuator is brought into a stopped state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> Next, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> supplies ON/OFF control signal to the three-state buffer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through an input terminal <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, thereby making the three-state buffer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which is normally kept in a disable state to be turned into an enable state so that for example 48 Hz pulse signal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) is supplied from the pulse signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In this connection, it is to be noted that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) the zero level signal between the high level and the low level of the pulse signal which appears before the output of the pulse signal is an output of the three-state buffer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> under the unstable condition (high impedance condition). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when a high level pulse signal is supplied to the inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the signal level at the inverting input terminal becomes larger than the level of the second tracking PWM signal at the non-inverting input terminal, so that a minus difference is generated during the period of the high level of the signal. As a result, the tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is driven by the output produced by the minus difference, so that the beam being emitted onto the disc is scanned toward the outer circumferential direction in a large degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when a low level pulse signal is supplied to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the signal level at the non-inverting input terminal becomes smaller than the second tracking PWM signal at the non-inverting input terminal, so that a plus difference is generated during the period of the low level of the signal. As a result, the tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is driven by the output produced by the plus difference, so that the beam which has been scanned toward the outer circumferential direction as described above is in turn scanned toward the inner circumferential direction in a large degree. These operations are repeated in a cycle of the pulse signal from the pulse signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the beam scanning control utilizing the pulse signal, the relatively wide interval of the adjacent waves of the tracking error signal is changed into a relatively narrow interval as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>). Namely, since the beam is traversed onto the track (pre-groove and land) by this beam scanning, a component (eccentric component) corresponding to an eccentric component which would be caused by eccentricity in an optical disc is produced (see a portion of the waveform shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>) in which the interval between the adjacent waves is relatively narrow). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> Further, though not shown in the drawings, the relatively wide interval of the adjacent waves of the TLN signal also becomes narrow in the same manner as the tracking error signal described above. Namely, since the beam is traversed onto the track (pre-groove and land) by this beam scanning, a component (eccentric component) corresponding to an eccentric component which would be caused by eccentricity in an optical disc is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Therefore, not only in the case where a loaded optical disc has a large eccentric component but also in the case where a loaded optical disc has less or no eccentric component, it is possible to prevent undesired situation in which a waveform of the tracking error signal or the TLN signal is expanded (an interval between adjacent waves becomes wide). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Specifically, since the interval of adjacent waves becomes narrow as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>), it is possible to stably hold peaks and bottoms of the tracking error signal and TLN signal in the peak/bottom detection circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>). As a result, it becomes possible to accurately and reliably perform the offset adjustment for the TLN signal and the amplitude adjustment for the tracking error signal which will be described below in more details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Although the above description was made with regard to the case where the beam is scanned toward the inner circumferential direction or the outer circumferential direction by driving the tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. However, in the present invention, it is also possible to control movement of the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> toward inner and outer circumferential directions of an optical disc by driving the sled motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For this purpose, the sled motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is driven by the pulse signal described above, so that the same effect as described above can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> Further, in the present invention, it is also possible to construct the apparatus such that the beam scanning is carried out toward inner and outer circumferential directions of an optical disc by driving both the sled motor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the tracking actuator coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> (7) Canceling Operation for Offset Component of TLN Signal </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Normally, the TLN signal contains an offset component (direct current component). This offset component fluctuates due to various factors such as ambient temperature, deterioration resulted from elapse of time, tilting degree of an optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, loading condition of an optical disc and the like. Therefore, the TLN signal does not always fluctuate within a certain amplitude level with respect to the reference level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Specifically, when the offset component becomes large as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not intersect the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In such a case, it is not possible to digitize the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> accurately. With this result, it is no longer possible to count the number of the tracks above which the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has traversed. This makes it impossible to move the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the target track. Namely, it is not possible for the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to carry out accurate track jump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> In order to solve this problem, there is one approach in which a circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is arranged at the input side of the TLN signal to eliminate the offset component. As shown in the drawing, in this circuit, the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is amplified after an offset component contained in the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been eliminated using a capacitor C<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or the like. Therefore, it is possible for the TLN signal to have a large amplitude of which center lies in the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> However, the circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> has poor response with respect to changes in output. Therefore, once the amplitude of the TLN signal fluctuates or changes, the influence of the change of the amplitude continues for a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case of CD-R having a recorded portion in which data has been recorded and a non-rocorded portion in which no data has yet been recorded, the amplitude of the TLN signal becomes large when the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> passes above the recorded portion, while the amplitude thereof becomes small when the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> passes above the non-recorded portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, when the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is moved from the recorded portion to the non-recorded portion, the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> fluctuates so that the center of the amplitude gradually approaches to the reference level. This gives rise to a problem in that the TLN signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not intersect the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> even though the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has actually traversed above tracks, thus leading to poor accuracy in the digitizing process. As a result, an error will be caused in the counted number of tracks above which the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has passed, so that there is a case that it is not possible to move the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the target track accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> For these reasons, the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with a TLN signal generating (producing) apparatus which generates (produces) a TLN signal from which an offset component is cancelled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a block diagram which shows a first embodiment of the TLN signal producing apparatus used in the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the TLN signal producing apparatus is generally constructed from a first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> which produces a TLN signal based on the difference of the amount of light between a main beam and two sub-beams, a peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for detecting a peak value and a bottom value of the TLN signal fed from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> for applying a reference voltage which is used to cancel the offset component in the TLN signal into a non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a second differential amplifier (buffer) <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a third amplifier (buffer) <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, resistors R<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for variably controlling a reference voltage generated by the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> based on the peak and bottom values of the TLN signal detected by the peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and a digitizing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for digitizing the TLN signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> In more details, an output of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> which generates the TLN signal is connected to its inverting input terminal through the resister R<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in a feedback manner. A signal from the main beam which is formed by summing the detected signals a, b, c and d (RF signal: a&plus;b&plus;c&plus;d) is supplied to the inverting input terminal of the amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through a resister R<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a signal from the two sub-beams which is formed by summing the detected signals e, f, g and h (k&prime;(e&plus;f&plus;g&plus;h)) is supplied to a non-inverting input terminal of the amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through a resister R<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is used to match the level of the latter signal to the level of the main beam signal. The output of the amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is supplied to the peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as the TLN signal. Further, this TLN signal is also supplied to the digitizing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and digitized therein, and then it is supplied to the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through an output terminal <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> A first reference voltage of e.g. 2.5V and a second reference voltage of e.g. 1.25V are applied to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to be able to variably control a reference voltage outputted from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> between 1.25V and 2.5V in 256 levels (8 bits), for instance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> The reference voltage outputted from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is supplied to an inverting input terminal of the second differential amplifier <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. An output of this second differential amplifier <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is connected to its non-inverting input terminal in a feedback manner. The output of the second differential amplifier <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is also connected to a non-inverting input terminal of the third differential amplifier <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> through a resister R<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An output of this third differential amplifier <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is also connected to its non-inverting input terminal in a feedback manner. Further, a voltage of e.g. 3.75V is also applied to the non-inverting input terminal of the third differential amplifier <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> through a resister R<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The output of the third differential amplifier <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is also connected to the inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through a resister R<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, in the case where the value of the resistance of the resister R<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is represented by r<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the value of the resistance of the resister R<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is represented by r<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the values of the r<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and r<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are respectively set so as to have a relationship represented by r<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>/r<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&equals;&frac12;. In this way, the reference voltage outputted from the third differential amplifier <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, that is the reference voltage to be inputted into the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is variably controlled between 2.1V and 2.9V in 256 levels (8 bits), for instance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be made with regard to the operation of the TLN signal generating apparatus of the first embodiment having the above structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> This TLN signal generating apparatus is operated in accordance with the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> so as to cancel an offset component of the TLN signal. The process of this flow chart starts at the time when a focus tray is completed (a focus servo is engaged) after an optical disc has been loaded to the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this connection, it is to be noted that this flow chart is designed so that an offset component of the TLN signal with respect to the reference voltage of 2.5V is cancelled, that is the center of the amplitudes of the TLN signal is set to be 2.5V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> supplies an address data setting signal for initializing the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> so as to set an output voltage thereof to be an initial value of 1.875V which is a median voltage value between 1.25V and 2.5V. This means that an input voltage to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is set to be an initial value of 2.5V which is a median voltage value between 2.1V and 2.9V. Then, this process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this connection, it is to be understood that the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> produces, when it is initialized by the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a reference voltage of 2.5V (corresponding to a converted value of an input voltage to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) which is an analogue signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), and then outputs the reference voltage in response to a reference clock signal for signal transmission supplied from the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This reference voltage is applied to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through the second and third differential amplifiers <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> initializes the variable V stored therein, and then the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This variable V is a value which is used to generate a reference voltage for canceling the offset component of the TLN signal from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Since the value of the variable which has been used when the optical disc was loaded can not be used as it is, the value is once initialized in this Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> carries out the beam scanning in the radial direction of the loaded optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by means of the eccentric component generating apparatus as was described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> so as to produce the eccentric component described above, and then the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this way, the TLN signal (having a waveform of a narrow interval) containing a predetermined eccentric component as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is outputted from the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> detects a peak value and a bottom value of thus generated TLN signal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), and then supplies the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with these values as a bottom hold signal and a peak hold signal, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is kept in a waiting condition for a predetermined time until the eccentric component produced in Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes stable, that is until the TLN signal becomes stable so that an accurate peak hold signal and bottom signal can be supplied. After the predetermined time has elapsed, the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> carries out sampling of the peak hold signal and the bottom hold signal from the peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by means of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and then acquires the sampling results in the form of digital data. Then, the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> carries out calculation on the acquired peak hold signal and bottom hold signal to obtain &frac12; value of the sum of these signals, which is used to determine the center value (C) of the amplitude of the present TLN signal. Then, the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> detects a difference between 2.5V which is a target center value of the amplitude of the TLN signal and the center value (C) of the amplitude of the present TLN signal which was obtained in Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. When it is determined that the difference value is zero, the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and in this Step the eccentric component generating apparatus is controlled so as to stop the beam scanning in the radial direction of the disc which was started at Step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and thereby all the routine of the program shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is ended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if it is determined in Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that the center value (C) of the amplitude of the present TLN signal is less than 2.5V, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> carries out control so that the reference voltage outputted from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> becomes 2.5031V (that is, 2.5V&plus;0.0031V) (which is a converted value of an input voltage to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) by incrementing the preset value of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> by one, and then the process returns to Step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the routine comprised of Steps S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are repeatedly executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> Further, if it is determined in Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that the center value (C) of the amplitude of the present TLN signal is greater than 2.5V, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> carries out control so that the reference voltage outputted from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> becomes 2.4969V (that is, 2.5V&minus;0.0031V) (which is a converted value of an input voltage to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) by decrementing the preset value of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> by one, and then the process returns to Step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the routine comprised of Steps S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are repeatedly executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> As described above, the reference voltage outputted from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> (which is a converted value of an input voltage to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) is variable between 2.1V and 2.9V in 256 levels with 2.5V as its center. Therefore, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> controls the reference voltage one by one level in a variable manner until it will be determined that the difference between the center value (C) of the amplitude of the present TLN signal and 2.5V is zero, and for this purpose the routine comprised of Steps S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are repeatedly executed. When it is determined at Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that the difference between the center value (C) of the amplitude of the present TLN signal and 2.5V is zero, that is when it is determined that the center value (C) of the amplitude of the present TLN signal is 2.5V, a determination is made that the offset component of the TLN signal has been cancelled, and then all the routine of the program shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is ended after the Step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the TLN signal producing apparatus of the first embodiment, it is possible to cancel the offset component contained in the TLN signal by carrying out variable control for the output voltage value of the D/A converter which generates the reference voltage, and this has a good response for fluctuation of the amplitude of the TLN signal. In this way, the TLN signal becomes always intersected with the reference level L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as was described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, so that it becomes possible to accurately digitize the TLN signal by the digitizing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (the PU drive and control signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). With this result, since it is possible to accurately count the number of tracks above which the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has traversed, accuracy in the fine search can be remarkably improved. In addition, even if an optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in which no data is recorded or an optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a recorded portion and a non-recorded portion is used, it is possible to move the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the target track accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> Although the above explanation has been made with reference to the example in which the initial value of the reference voltage outputted from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is set to be a voltage vale of 2.5V (which is a converted value of an input voltage to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) which is a median value of the variable range, and from this state the reference voltage is gradually varied based on the difference between the center value of the amplitude of the present TLN signal and the target value (target voltage value). However, besides the above example, the present invention can be applied to a modification in which the initial value of the reference voltage outputted from D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is set to be a voltage vale of 2.1V (which is a converted value of an input voltage to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) which is the minimum value in the variable range, and from this state the reference voltage value is gradually raised based on difference between the center value of the amplitude of the present TLN signal and the target value (target voltage value). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> For better understanding, examples of the respective waveforms of the TLN signal, the bottom hold signal and the peak hold signal under this variable control are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) to (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> Further, on the contrary to the modification described above, the present invention can be also applied to another modification in which the initial value of the reference voltage outputted from D/A converter <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is set to be a voltage vale of 2.9V (which is a converted value of an input voltage to the non-inverting input terminal of the first differential amplifier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) which is the maximum value in the variable range, and from this state the reference voltage value is gradually lowered based on difference between the center value of the amplitude of the present TLN signal and the target value (target voltage value). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, these examples can be constructed so that the difference between the center value of the amplitude of the TLN signal and the target value becomes zero only by one time adjustment of the reference voltage value. In this regard, it is to be noted that all of these examples can achieve the same effect as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> Moreover, although in the first embodiment described above the offset component canceling operation is to be carried out at the time when an optical disc has been loaded, it is also possible to carry out such a canceling operation not only at the time when an optical disc has been loaded but also at every time upon a focus servo being engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> Hereinbelow, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33, a</cross-reference> second embodiment of the TLN signal generating apparatus of the present invention will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> is a block diagram which shows a circuit configuration of the second embodiment of the TLN signal generating apparatus used in the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, the TLN signal generating apparatus <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> constitutes a part of the pick-up drive and control signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which generally comprises a TLN signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, and a high boost filter (signal correcting circuit) <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> for correcting the TLN signal supplied from the TLN signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, and a digitizing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for digitizing the TLN signal fed from the high boost filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> The TLN signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is constructed from a differential amplifier <highlight><bold>751</bold></highlight> provided with an operational amplifier OP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> The high boost filter <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is generally composed of resisters R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an operational amplifier OP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Namely, a serial connection circuit comprised of the resister R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected in parallel to the resister R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and an output side thereof is connected to a minus terminal of the operation amplifier OP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the minus terminal is connected to an output side of the operational amplifier OP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the resister R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Further, a reference voltage Vref is applied to the plus input terminal of the operation amplifier OP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the resister R<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, this high boost filter <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> has characteristics in that amplification factor increases linearly within a frequency band from 10 Hz (first frequency) to 1 kHz (second frequency), so that it has an amplification factor of about 1 time (0 dB) when the frequency is less than or equal to 10 Hz and amplification factor of about 5 times (14 dB) when the frequency is less than or equal to 1 kHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> The TLN signal generated in the TLN signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is inputted into the high boost filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and it is corrected therein. Namely, when the TLN signal is passed through the high boost filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a direct current component and an alternating current component less than or equal to 10 Hz pass therethrough without being amplified, so that an alternating current component higher than or equal to 1 kHz is amplified by about 5 times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> Normally a frequency of the TLN signal upon the track jump is about 2 to 3 kHz. Therefore, only a necessary component in the TLN signal is amplified by about 5 times by passing the TLN signal through the high boost filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> The TLN signal which has been corrected by the high boost filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is inputted into the digitizing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> as described above, and then digitized in the digitizing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Thus digitized TLN signal is inputted into the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and it is then used for a fine search. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> shows the TLN signal before passing through the high boost filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>), and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> shows the TLN signal after passing through the high boost filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> As shown in these drawings, the level of the alternating current component of the TLN signal after passing through the high boost filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (point P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> is greater than that of the TLN signal before passing through the high boost filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (point P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. Therefore, the TLN signal which has passed through the high boost filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> always intersects with the reference level without receiving any influence from the offset component contained in the TLN signal. As a result, since it is possible to accurately digitize the TLN signal, the number of tracks above which the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has traversed can be counted accurately, thereby making it possible to remarkably improve the accuracy at the fine search. This means that even if an optical disc in which no data has yet been recorded or an optical disc which has a recorded portion and a non-recorded portion is used, it is possible to move the optical pick-up <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the target track accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> In this connection, it is to be noted that the amplification factor of the alternating current component in each of the first and second frequencies at the high boost filter <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> and the frequency (frequency band) of each of the first and second frequencies can be adjusted (set) in a desirable manner by changing any one of the size of any one or more of the resisters R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the capacitance of the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> In the above, the second embodiment of the TLN signal generating apparatus of the present invention was described with reference to the drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment and the structure of the respective components or elements may be replaced with other components or elements having the same function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> For example, instead of the high boost filter used in the second embodiment, other circuits can be used if they have a function that amplifies an alternating current component contained in the TLN signal without eliminating a direct current component contained in the TLN signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) Amplitude Adjustment Operation for Tracking Error Signal </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> As was described above, in recent years, various optical discs such as CD-R, CD-ROM, CD-RW have been developed and then widely used. Therefore, it is desired that it is possible to playback and record these optical discs with a single optical disc drive in a compatible manner. However, since the reflectances of the reflective layers of CD-R, CD-ROM and CD-RW are different from each other, the tracking error signals obtained from these optical discs are also different from each other. Further, even among optical discs of the same type, there is a case that amplitudes of tracking error signals are different from each other due to individual differences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> Specifically, if an amplitude of a tracking error signal reproduced from a data disc of CD-R (having pre-pits) is supposed to be 1, an amplitude of a tracking error signal reproduced from a data disc of CD-ROM is approximate to 0.7 and an amplitude of a tracking error signal reproduced from a data disc of CD-WR is approximate to 3.5, respectively. Therefore, if amplitude adjustment would not be performed so as to meet the respective disc, a tracking servo will not be engaged properly, thus making it difficult to perform accurate recording and playing back control. For these reasons, the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention is provided with an amplitude adjustment apparatus which adjusts an amplitude of a tracking error signal into the optimum state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> shows a circuit configuration of the amplitude adjustment apparatus. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, the amplitude adjustment apparatus is generally composed of a differential amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which generates a tracking error signal, a D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> which outputs an tracking error signal having an optimum amplitude by multiplying the tracking error signal from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> by an optimum coefficient, a differential amplifier (buffer) <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> provided at the output side of the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, a peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which detects a peak value and a bottom value of the tracking error signal from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and a control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for variably controlling the coefficient M in the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> in e.g. 256 levels (8 bits) based on the peak value and bottom values of the tracking error signal detected by the peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In this regard, it is to be noted that in this embodiment, the coefficient M is represented by the following Equation (3). </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Coefficient <highlight><italic>M&equals;N/</italic></highlight>256 (here, <highlight><italic>N </italic></highlight>is an integer from 0 to 255)&emsp;&emsp;(3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> In more details, an output of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is connected to its inverting input terminal in a feedback manner. A reference voltage (Vref) is supplied from an input terminal <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to the inverting input terminal of the amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> through a resister R<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and a tracking error signal in the form of a push pull signal is supplied from the input terminal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to a non-inverting input terminal of the amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> through a resister R<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Further, the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is constructed so that an output thereof is returned to its non-inverting input terminal in a feedback manner, and the tracking error signal from the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> which has undergone the amplitude adjustment is supplied to an inverting input terminal of the amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the tracking error signal outputted from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is supplied to the peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as well as the CD servo controller <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through an output terminal <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> In this regard, it is to be noted that the tracking error signal supplied from the input terminal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is amplified by the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to a required and sufficient level, and then it is inputted into the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> where it undergoes the amplitude adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a description will be made with reference to the operation of the amplitude adjustment apparatus for the tracking error signal having the above described structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> The amplitude adjustment apparatus is operated in accordance with the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> to carry out the amplitude adjustment for the tracking error signal. The process of this flow chart starts at the time when a focus tray is completed (a focus servo is engaged) after an optical disc has been loaded to the optical disc drive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then the process proceed to Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this connection, it is to be noted that this flow chart is designed so that an amplitude adjustment is carried out in such a way that the value of the amplitude of the tracking error signal becomes approximate to 1.5 Vpp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> supplies an address data setting signal to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> for initializing the coefficient M in the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> into zero (that is, {fraction (0/256)}), and then the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> carries out the beam scanning in the radial direction of the loaded optical disc <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by means of the eccentric component generating apparatus as was described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> so as to produce the eccentric component described above, and then the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this way, a tracking error signal containing a predetermined eccentric component as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) (that is, a tracking error signal having a waveform of a narrow interval) is outputted from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, and then it is supplied to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> The D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> carries out amplitude adjustment by multiplying the tracking error signal supplied from the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> by the coefficient M (&equals;0) which has been initialized by the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and then outputs the tracking error signal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) which has undergone the amplitude adjustment in response to a reference clock for signal transmission supplied from the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The tracking error signal is supplied to the peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> detects a peak value and a bottom value of the tracking error signal which has undergone the amplitude adjustment, and then supplies these values to the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a peak hold signal and a bottom hold signal, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is kept in a waiting condition for a predetermined time until the eccentric component generated in Step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> becomes stable, that is until the tracking error signal becomes stable so that an accurate peak hold signal and bottom signal can be supplied. After the predetermined time has elapsed, the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> carries out sampling of the peak hold signal and the bottom hold signal from the peak and bottom detecting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by means of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and then acquires the sampling results in the form of digital data. Then, the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> detects a difference value (pp: peak to peak) between the acquired peak hold signal and the bottom hold signal, thereby detecting the amplitude value of the present tracking error signal, and the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> determines as to whether the amplitude value of the tracking error signal detected in Step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is less than 1.5 Vpp which is a target value. The value of 1.5 Vpp described herein means the minimum amplitude value. Therefore, in this Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a determination is made to know as to whether or not the amplitude value of the present tracking error signal exceeds the minimum value which is the value that will not affect the tracking servo system in the subsequent stages. In the case where &ldquo;NO&rdquo; determination is made in this Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, that is to say in the case where the amplitude value of the present tracking error signal is equal to 1.5 Vpp or slightly greater than 1.5 Vpp, the process proceeds to Step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in order to show that the amplitude value of the tracking error signal is in an appropriate value, in which the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> controls the eccentric component generating apparatus so as to stop the beam scanning in the radial direction of the disc started at Step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and thereby all the routine of the program shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> is ended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the case where &ldquo;YES&rdquo; determination is made in the Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, that is to say in the case where the amplitude value of the present tracking error signal is less than 1.5 Vpp, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> increases the coefficient M which is multiplied to the tracking error signal at the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> by {fraction (1/256)} by incrementing the preset value N in the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> shown in Equation (3) described above in order to perform the amplitude adjustment for the tracking error signal again, thereby the process returns to Step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and then the routine comprised of Steps S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is executed repeatedly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> As described above, the coefficient M which is to be multiplied to the tracking error signal at the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is variable within <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> levels. Therefore, the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> carries out the variable control for the coefficient M one level by one level (that is, {fraction (1/256)} at a time) at Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> until it is determined that the amplitude value of the present tracking error signal becomes greater than 1.5 Vpp which is a target value, and for this purpose the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> executes the routine comprised of Steps S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> repeatedly. Then, when it is determined that the amplitude value of the present tracking error signal has become greater than 1.5 Vpp at Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a determination is made that the amplitude value of the tracking error signal has become the optimum value, and then all the routine of the program shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> is ended after the Step S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has been executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> As described above, the amplitude adjustment apparatus makes it possible to control the amplitude value of the tracking error signal into the optimum value by performing the variable control for the coefficient which is used in a multiplication process for the tracking error signal. Therefore, it is possible to adjust the amplitude value of the tracking error signal to a constant value irrespective of different types of optical discs such as CD-R, CD-ROM and CD-RW and individual differences in the same type optical discs, thereby making it possible to obtain a constant gain in the tracking servo system and a stability of the tracking servo system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> Although the above explanation was made with reference to the case where the control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> gradually increments the coefficient which is used in the multiplication process for the tracking error signal {fraction (1/256)} by {fraction (1/256)} from 1, it is also possible to decrement it one {fraction (1/256)} by {fraction (1/256)} from 2 in a contrary manner. Alternatively, it is also possible to previously set a coefficient suited for a frequently used optical disc in the D/A converter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> as an initial value, and then increment or decrement the coefficient by a predetermined number from the initial value. The same result described above can be also obtained in this modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> Although in the foregoing the description was made with regard to the embodiments of the TLN signal generating apparatus used in then optical disc drive and the optical disc drive equipped with the TLN signal generating apparatus as well as the amplitude adjusting apparatus for the tracking error signal according to the present invention, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, and it goes without saying that the structure of each component or element cane be replaced with other structure having the same function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> For example, the optical disc drive according to the present invention is not limited to a CD-R drive described above. The present invention can be applied to other various disc drives which can play back or record and playback optical discs having a pre-groove such as CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RAM and the like and which can only play back optical discs such as CD (compact disc), CD-ROM and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the TLN signal generating apparatus used in an optical disc drive and an optical disc drive equipped with the TLN signal generating apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to digitize the TLN signal accurately without receiving any influence from the offset component contained in the TLN signal (track loss signal). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> In particular, according to the structure of the first embodiment, since the level of the TLN signal is controlled by adjusting the reference voltage value which is used when the TLN signal is generated, the apparatus can realize a good response to the fluctuation of the amplitude of the TLN signal. Further, according to the structure of the second embodiment, since an alternating current component contained in the TLN signal is amplified without eliminating a direct current component contained in the TLN signal, it can also realize a good response to the fluctuation of the amplitude of the TLN signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> Further, in the case where the optical pick-up is moved to a target track by grasping the radial position of the optical pickup relative to the optical disc based on the TLN signal, it is possible to accurately count the number of tracks above which the optical pick-up has traversed, so that it becomes possible to move the optical pick-up to the target track accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the optical disc drive equipped with the amplitude adjusting apparatus for tracking error signal, it is possible to adjust the value of the amplitude in a constant value irrespective of types of optical discs and individual differences between the same optical discs. This makes it possible to hold a gain in the tracking servo constant and to obtain stability in the tracking servo operation. </paragraph>
